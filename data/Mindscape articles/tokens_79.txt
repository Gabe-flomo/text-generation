and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll in episode i have a conversation with an old 
of mine who happens to also be an enormously respected scientist and writer janna levin like me janna maintains 
an active research program a professor of physics at columbia university in barnard college where she thinks about black 
and cosmology and astrophysics in various ways but also a broader effort to interact with other disciplines and with 
general public but we choose slightly different ways of going about that broader impact kind of sector of our 
in particular what janna has done is mastered a way of writing about science that is fundamentally narrative in 
and tone her books that explain science to a broader public really read like novels and in fact one 
them is basically a novel she mixes the human side of science with the actual research being done better 
anyone else that i know sc so talk a little bit about her research always where things come from 
some sense but mostly about the book written and why she chooses to write about science in this way 
most recent book which i recommend that you read is called hole and about the discovery of gravitational waves 
building of the ligo observatory and all the effort that went into that over the years so this conversation 
as an interesting companion piece to my conversation with kip thorne from just a couple of episodes ago as 
was there he was one of the people who was interviewed by janna for his efforts in helping to 
ligo and make it happen so you get different sides of the same story which is interesting to compare 
this talk has two old friends talking at great length lots of laughs i think gonna enjoy this ride 
music sc janna levin welcome to the mindscape podcast janna levin ah thanks for having me sc so as 
reminiscing here prerecording known each other for a long time we were graduate students but not at the same 
you started out at mit and i went to harvard so tell us a little bit about the trajectory 
like what you started trying to study and where you are now jl well mostly we usually talk about 
meeting story chuckle sc that yes welcome to tell that jl which is what were we on we were 
what were they called tram tram sc the t the t is the subway jl the t oh god 
cute in boston called the t sc the red line yeah jl and i think i was reading birrell 
davies quantum field theory in curved spacetime as you do as you do sc right clearly trying to attract 
yes chuckle jl during rush hour laughter and then this tall skinny dude is literally over me like i 
birrell and davies quantum fields in curved laughter sc no leaving out the best part i was with a 
i knew who was trying to hit on you jl oh yeah right right sc and tried to save 
by saying you reading a book on quantum field theory in curved chuckle jl so basically yes you yes 
he was mad at me afterward yeah jl was he he should be well no he be i was 
mad at you chuckle so so a benefit and basically been friends since which is kind of hilarious sc 
extremely hilarious but you jl we studied a lot we studied a lot together sc there were a lot 
problems sets jl a lot of problems sets a lot sc general relativity jl discussions about whether coffee should 
milk in it or not how much coffee should be drunk after midnight laughter sc at am when in 
middle of a problem set this is very important decision making jl crucial so i would say that chuckle 
terms of trajectory i was definitely not that kid who thought i was gonna be a scientist and i 
it really late i had really negative ideas about science and physics in particular which is really kind of 
in retrospect chuckle like my punishment in life was to become a physicist and have sc right jl redefine 
identity so i think that one thing that you and i always really enjoyed when we were even students 
the sort of creative aspect of physics and how there are different solutions and different ways to approach things 
that like cracking the walnut you find these really clever insights and just this pleasure this pleasure to be 
to the universe through this medium which is wild that it works and i feel like you and i 
grew up together with that learning not like high school college level but like feeling it using it sc 
because in graduate school that you first get to sort of be right up close and personal with the 
in some sense right jl right right right and still asking the most naive questions then sc i hope 
yeah jl and so sweet so sweet laughter sc and a lot of people do something in grad school 
then end up doing it for their lives right jl yeah sc which is not exactly what done jl 
true sc tell us what science you did in grad school jl well gosh i was kinda lost in 
school to be honest because i at my happiest point chuckle but i was definitely working on alternative theories 
gravity and space time stuff and how to interpret the big bang but i think it was my best 
i know not my best work i think that a lot of that came later with sort of more 
in lots of different subjects and less trying to prove something to somebody sc right jl graduate school was 
much about making sure your professors thought a certain thing about you so that you could go sc yeah 
and my most creative work definitely came i think later when i felt less of that less constrained by 
other people thought sc and yeah so you got into a whole bunch of interesting buzzwords stirred together with 
theory and topology and cosmology and black holes jl still like all that stuff sc yeah still like all 
stuff laughter sc so what does it mean jl all good stuff sc how does that come together to 
science jl well funny so i think that right from a distance it looks like none of the things 
in have a coherent theme but they all do really which is basically spacetime physics basically the coherent terrain 
which all the other stuff plays out so even when done chaos theory which i learned a lot from 
people just by collaborating with other people who were very thoughtful about dynamical systems the best way to learn 
is from other scientists so very much borrowing and sharing and collaborating on chaos theory from people like neil 
it all happened in a curved spacetime where we were interested and one of the most interesting questions was 
is usually defined as a loss of predictability over time an exponential deviation over time but you define a 
time in relativity the whole point so suddenly you have this does it mean to be chaotic are there 
and chaos really does mean that there are not functional solutions sorry my phone laughter jl god damn it 
thought i put it on silent that there are not functional solutions to the equations of motion unambiguous it 
ambiguous whose time what time so a lot of the fun we had was to try to make understandable 
of chaos that were the same for all observers in spacetime sc well this actually puzzled me about chaos 
always puzzles about chaos maybe because i learned relativity first in relativity time is up to you you can 
time however you want jl right sure so you could have a logarithmic time or something like that where 
chaos goes away sc no the other way around thinking if two things diverge only linearly with time define 
to be log time jl right right right overlapping conversation jl and make it exponential sc so did you 
is there other ways jl yeah so what we realized is that in a lot of these systems what 
can look at is the possibility of large sets so for instance large numbers of orbits around black holes 
they merge or escape or are stable that you can begin to find fractal sets in the space of 
and fractals are unambiguous declarations of chaotic behavior because happening with a fractal which is so smart that nature 
is it figures out a way to pack tons of information in the smallest space possible right so our 
can remain volumewise smallish chuckle but surfacewise very large by having lots of fractal folds sc because the brain 
a twodimensional sheet crumpled up inside of our head jl exactly crumpling it up making it a fractal allows 
to have this huge surface area without scaling up the volume which we support on our little necks with 
sc and so what are you looking at in the black hole throwing a particle at it and seeing 
it comes out jl so we would yeah an example two black holes can be arranged to be completely 
with charge and gravity balancing so charged so electromagnetically repulsive but massive so gravitationally attractive and you can tune 
just on paper to be perfectly stable sc these are not real experiments these are thought experiments yes jl 
are not real experiments this does not exist in astrophysics but the orbits of stuff around those two will 
like a pinball game be like a complex game of pinball and so what you can do is look 
the fractal set of possibilities so how many little things you throw in there fall in how many little 
escape how many little things are stable and if you start to try to very precisely define whether stable 
or escaping no matter how precise you try to make those definitions you still find a mixture of all 
sc right jl and classic fractal behavior that you look closer and closer and you still pinpoint what happens 
subtle subtle dependence and the tiniest difference in the initial condition leads to the exactly opposite outcome so what 
did show was that the fractal dimension was related to things like the lyapunov exponent which is measures in 
sc tell us what that jl i know oh geez sc you said it sorry chuckle jl no my 
oh my god that was a really naughty laughter so if it was just ordinary space we would say 
the time scale over which there was a divergence of predictability was set by something called the lyapunov exponent 
because of what you raised about the ambiguity of time and relativity different for every different observer so we 
basically able to show that the fractal dimension was the same for all observers sc right okay good jl 
it was a combination of things like lyapunov time scale and spatial time details matter but everybody would agree 
the fractal was there sc and this is a classic thing that physicists like to do that you can 
of calculate something one way but you worry that it depends on how you calculated it so you look 
something you can show everyone would agree on this no matter how they calculate it jl yeah physics is 
hard in that way laughter jl physics is nothing if not hard sc tell the audience that been telling 
very easy the whole time laughter jl yeah so what you want is a measure of something the same 
all observers really what you strive for so as you well know in relativity you say time is the 
for all observers you say space is the same for all observers but you can say that a space 
interval sc right jl which is a measure in the fourdimensional space time which is the same for all 
and really gratifying and that you can orient all your interpretations around that invariant sc and did this interest 
the chaotic behavior particles going around black holes lead you later to think about real astrophysical black holes that 
out there jl it did oh my god this and i think and i also suffer from this a 
bit which is that in our youngest years being most fascinated with the most abstract most surreal maybe not 
physically relevant sc right jl because there was something about it that just appealed to our taste sc yeah 
for the audience out there there are astrophysicists who are as i keep saying relatively down to earth despite 
astrophysics right worried about real stuff we see it in telescopes we understand the underlying physics but then some 
us who go right to the edges of what we understand which is a little fuzzier jl yeah and 
think that still that pull for me but a part of as i started to sort of think about 
contribution and what comes back to you i wanted to see something predicted and verified sc yeah about nature 
the end of the day right jl about nature at the end of day this and i love to 
it an unrequited love for nature laughter jl we love her she does not love us back laughter sc 
true jl she is quite indifferent to us laughter sc very indifferent playing hard to get jl she is 
hard to get so i think that there was this sense of god if there was one thing just 
thing and then go back to my insane abstractions but one thing that was verifiable while i was alive 
would feel so good it would be so fun it would be very childlike sc right jl just exploratory 
then the instant gratification chuckle sc and they pay us to do this and yeah jl so yes it 
lead me from being completely theoretical imagined models of black holes to a minute there are real black holes 
there pretty cool there are things that we can say about them that people said yet still in some 
accessible to so i started getting really into more how black holes could contribute to electronic circuits and weird 
like that sc but wait a minute i think that the typical person listening is going electronic circuits i 
jl yeah chuckle sc a little lab room and i put things together and a light bulb comes up 
how do i stick a wire into the black hole and light a light bulb or what jl so 
one of these things that i learned as a student but always never really understood and one of the 
i try to tell my students now is that if you understand something keep leaning on it because maybe 
crack something that everyone else has been glib about and this was sort of one of those examples which 
black holes have no hair meaning they cannot support complicated things like magnetic field lines that magnetic field lines 
you remember in high school throwing iron shavings around a magnet and seeing the path of the field lines 
out that you see with your eyes but that the iron filings traced out for you that you see 
that really looks like sc yeah jl coming out of the top of a head chuckle and then usually 
into the chin chuckle jl so sc perfectly spherical head jl chuckle a hair beard sc and the earth 
such a magnetic field neutron stars have very big magnetic fields but black holes no jl neutron stars exactly 
holes though formally proved cannot support the hair of magnetic fields meaning they just have them so i was 
confused about that because as you said neutron stars have these big magnetic fields they can be a trillion 
that of the earth literally the strongest magnets in the universe neutron stars almost black holes but not quite 
dead stars that make it to be black holes and if a black hole swallows one which we suspect 
quite frequently what happens to the magnetic field and there was always this very glib argument and i think 
it just by not accepting the standard lore and just sort of scratching at it sc just being stubborn 
just being stubborn chuckle realized that this phase where the huge magnet is whipping around the black hole and 
to create an electronic circuit so if i disconnect a light bulb out of a lamp i know i 
a lamp here and i disconnect the light bulb and i hold it in my hand in principle absolute 
electricity magnetism no relativity no black holes nothing fancy if i wave a magnet around strongly enough i will 
up that light bulb sc right jl it need to be plugged into a battery or the wall or 
so i create electricity by waving magnet sc because the magnetic field stretches away from the magnet so even 
you see it something stretching from the magnet to the light bulb jl yes varying magnetic fields create electric 
sc it is not spooky action at a distance jl not spooky action at a distance completely predictable totally 
totally natural and so basically what we have we have this magnet whipping around near the speed of light 
the black hole and creating actually an incredibly powerful electronic circuit i know how we were the first ones 
point this out this is basically from like laughter sc but there is so many things like that like 
have pointed this out therefore i think about right and then you lose the chance jl yeah yeah and 
this nohair theorem which is so lovely say that a black hole have a magnetic field it says it 
only have the magnetic field consistent with these certain circumstances sc the stuff around it jl exactly and charge 
we can get into later so fun i was drawing circuit diagrams for the biggest most powerful batteries in 
universe sc well it seems like just doing it for fun but where a lot of great science comes 
right why care about chaos and black holes or electric circuits and black holes part of the motivation might 
not jl fun sc well this is going to lead us to the super secrets of the universe just 
of cool jl it is cool totally sc and were the super secrets sometimes get revealed jl yeah and 
think when people and i know you and i have also had this conversation privately but when people say 
like murdering to dissect it make you feel glum or despair that the universe is this mathematical machine sc 
see god there in the black hole yeah jl i know how you can walk away from this and 
feel meaning sc right jl not feel exactly the opposite which is are we so fortunate to be connected 
the origin of the universe through what a gift and that so meaningful and so moving so we absolutely 
this for emotional reasons chuckle sc yeah and which is fine there are no other reasons right where the 
come from laughter jl exactly sc and this is a great segue right into what i mostly wanna talk 
was been extraordinarily successful in addition to the science at things science adjacent especially in telling stories telling stories 
about science or scientifically inflected and written several books a memoir a novel and a narrative history so in 
case a story going on so it i know whether you either wanna tell us about the first book 
tell us about the underlying motivations throughout them jl yeah i super interested in structure in writing and i 
we are all taught to write very very badly chuckle and i was a philosophy student four philosophers and 
this is also another conversation we have to get into later i learned to write so badly and i 
it and i sc because of the philosophers yeah jl because of the philosophers i love philosophers sc sure 
physicists would have taught you just as badly jl oh my god even worse even worse writing passive construction 
it was shown by and it is known that whatever terrible but i grew up loving books and loving 
and loving fiction not so much nonfiction actually not a huge nonfiction reader so it was so much the 
of fiction fiction is so rich and so complicated and so interesting so every time i sat down to 
a book i would be lost in terms of structure structure was always the hardest thing what am i 
structurally not what am i trying to say that was in some sense more accessible sc you had that 
yeah i kinda knew what that was but how to say it was so challenging and time and time 
i would throw away entire books the second book especially which ended up being a novel i tried to 
as a straight forward nonfiction expository math proof sort of discussion about what can be known and what be 
the unknowability of certain mathematical facts sc this is the book about turing and gödel jl yeah turing and 
and it just was wrong and so i threw away an entire book in order to write this other 
which was a novel which structurally seemed to be truer which was to say there are some facts we 
know simply by listing the data in mathematics we would say the transformation rules from the axioms do not 
yield a theorem which is verifiable within the context of that you know the word looking that theory sc 
formal system yeah jl that formal system and so the whole idea of the novel was there are some 
we can only get to by stepping outside by being fictionalized or by being a narrative or by being 
different sc right once you say that of course it has to be a novel right jl chuckle exactly 
it became a novel with an unreliable narrator who know the truth but is grasping for the truth and 
was such a pleasure to write it was such a pleasure once it was a terrible pain before i 
that but once i made that decision it just became this fluid i just knew what i was doing 
is there something besides the obvious that drew you to turing and alan turing famous computer scientist and kurt 
famous mathematician logician i mean both fascinating characters but did sorry this is the one book of yours i 
so i have to confess that right from the start laughter jl okay gonna go out for drinks and 
it to you laughter sc did yeah well download the audio book right now were they close did they 
jl no they never met sc they never met like who guessed that you wrote a novel about them 
but they knew each other they were very influenced by each other sc how do they fit together jl 
think oh wow a good question sean because i think the way people rarely ask me that because they 
together that well except for cumulatively their proof is about limitations on what we can know but i think 
was fascinated by the fact that turing became such a coolhearted atheist and that gödel continued to believe in 
afterlife where he would be reincarnated and find a more platonic existence in a pure mathematical state like i 
think that despite the fact that they started in the same intellectual mathematical core that they had these wildly 
beliefs and actually why i think i paired them sc why why we just be very straight forward realizing 
and i know who these people are but maybe not everyone does jl yeah fair enough sc who is 
turing jl like i said alan turing became very famous as a very young mathematician for realizing that there 
some numbers that were uncomputable meaning literally if you tried to mechanized thought and so here he invented the 
so this is why alan turning is most famous just point blank for inventing the entire idea of the 
which at the time was a word for people who calculated things but we now understand as a machine 
to do lots of flexible stuff sc yeah jl and they used to be called universal turing machines after 
but idea was to imagine mechanizing thought and figuring out a way in which theorems work and proofs work 
in that process he proved that there were numbers that could never be computed in a form shorter than 
number itself sc right jl so say i have a number it goes on and on for infinity the 
to generate that number is exactly as long as the number sc right jl no shorter which is not 
of the number two or three and fours we can write a very short code sc well the number 
it is true laughter jl the two plus two is five right orwell laughter sc but the square root 
jl yes the square root of two is actually an irrational number but it is computable in a very 
code sc exactly jl so the difference between square root of two and these other numbers was that there 
no code that could be written no mechanized system that could be devised that would yield the number any 
quickly than just randomly tossing the die of what the next digit should be after the decimal point okay 
it sounds very abstract but what it means is that there are facts about numbers simple numbers numbers between 
and one about which we will never know anything not only that but an infinite number of such numbers 
only that but the largest infinity of the numbers between zero and one sc yeah most numbers jl most 
are numbers about which we will never know anything okay so this is a cutting revelation in the time 
people are trying to recover from the wars and trying to find solace and rationality and trying to find 
sense so this belief that everything can be rational and noble and suddenly this kick in the teeth sc 
yeah this is all not only in the aftermath of world war ii but in the early days of 
century we had this optimism about mathematics russell and whitehead hilbert that had this jl hilbert sc gonna set 
some axioms gonna prove every true thing jl totally so here sc not gonna happen jl laughter turing is 
strange character lovely but very likely autistic openly gay and persecuted for his homosexuality and also contributed significantly to 
war effort turning the tide in favor of the allies and yet sc breaking codes jl breaking codes and 
is convicted of homosexuality and given hormone treatments which leave him depressed and devastated and suicidal and so it 
largely believed that he takes his own life he was obsessed with snow white which had recently been aired 
screened and he bit from a poison apple an apple that he dipped in cyanide and so some people 
things which might be apocryphal but that the mac symbol of the halfeaten apple the apple with the bite 
of it is a reference to turing turing does invent the computer in this indirect way because he what 
thinking about is mechanizing thought sc yep jl and then he not only says i bet i could build 
machine that could think as well as we that machines could think that ai so really the father of 
but then he says are machines that laughter jl so then he becomes this sort of cool atheist that 
gives up all of this other stuff and says simply are and i think been playing catchup with turing 
since sc right yeah and meanwhile austrian logician kurt gödel was he from austria or germany jl gödel yeah 
austrian sc home of any number of famous brilliant crazy people really jl i think i have a little 
of a thing for crazy brilliant people laughter sc you should move to austria laughter jl i do pretty 
in new york sc yeah okay laughter jl gödel was so fascinating he predates turing and he makes the 
blow so hilbert as you said is this brilliant mathematician the most powerful mathematician of the era turn of 
century and hilbert calls for a proof that all true facts among the numbers can be proven to be 
he literally mean he wants a list of an infinite number of proofs he sc but that it can 
done jl he just wants a proof that it can be done and everyone expects that this is true 
you expect this is true so gödel is the one who deals the first blow before turing really influenced 
work even though they never met and gödel shows really so lovely the way he does it that there 
facts among the numbers that can never be proven to be true and his is sc true facts jl 
facts sc well at what is the technical statement that either the formal system is jl true yeah sc 
there are true facts that be proven jl and he rejected inconsistency so either a boldfaced paradox in math 
he rejected or there are facts that be proven to be true and that is largely where people side 
would be much worse if one plus one was sometimes two and sometimes three laughter jl much worse sc 
put it past those mathematicians they come up with all sorts of crazy ideas jl yeah and so gödel 
that blow but he was a strange character he was very isolated and very withdrawn and had strange ideas 
the afterlife jl platonism he really believed in math was real in a physical sense i can never draw 
circle but no such thing as a perfect circle in reality but he believed that the and maybe right 
know chuckle that the mental experiment of a perfect circle is sufficient to prove it exists and i think 
and interesting i know laughter sc yeah he was a little crazy gödel but but they have this thing 
common where something that always slips through your fingers the more you tighten your grip right jl yes sc 
true about the universe that we can never grasp jl yes what gödel did and oh sean we should 
about this later laughter jl what gödel did which was so clever was he constructed a sentence which basically 
this true statement can never be proven and then he translated it through a very clever cipher into a 
arithmetic statement that was just like about numbers and proved that that equation was correct and therefore unprovable which 
true sc if it were provable it would have to be incorrect because the statement said unprovable yeah jl 
it is possible that you try to construct such a sentence and you cannot mathematize it and you prove 
but he mathematized it perfectly and there it was sc and ever since then every mathematician been trying to 
things and getting stuck is always wondering this one of the things that is not jl is this unprovable 
yeah rarely true jl so i know sure you get asked this a lot too which is you think 
never and my argument is until somebody proves to me we can never know it and that can happen 
we have examples of that in history in turing and gödel then we keep trying sc and then so 
are fascinating stories obviously very important human intellectual history blah blah blah so at what point did you say 
right way to tell this story is via a story via a novel jl i think just i failed 
badly at telling it as nonfiction it just working it it interesting it it would have not i just 
like sometimes we experience an element of truth in the solar plexus like we just feel it through the 
and that that spoke so much more even to the premise of there are things that we can only 
by stepping outside and looking in i mean that is really ultimately lesson is that you know true because 
step outside of the mathematical system and you reflect on it and you can declare true and that there 
something about narrative that allowed you to do exactly that sc right jl so i basically wanted to structure 
narrative on the premise of the theorems but i thought it would reach people much more than if i 
them to go through the agony of diagonalization method laughter sc okay but just between us that was an 
elegant and compelling rationale for why we but did you have that before you wrote the novel or did 
come up after you wrote it jl oh i no again i only had it after i failed at 
the nonfiction first laughter sc no but before you wrote the novel version did you say like maybe i 
to step out of the jl yeah sc okay jl by then by then by the time that i 
given way most so written three books and almost every one i write the wrong book first and i 
out and then i figure out what the right book is to write sc your process jl my process 
i it was painful it it feel good until i abandoned that first approach and then thought i mean 
gonna try and a lot of it is just worrying you have permission all sort of like that a 
bit do i have permission to do this am i gonna get slammed by my colleagues is my editor 
be furious is my agent gonna kill me so i have overcome all laughter sc any one of which 
perfectly reasonably implausible right i mean these things happen jl they they all basically showed up at my door 
torches sc yes laughter jl but even my last book the third book was the same way i kept 
to do the right thing to do what was expected of me and failing and then just you have 
terrible moment where you decide okay worse laughter jl a bad book sc right jl or getting some flack 
every single time my agent my editor and my scientist friends have all stepped up so in reality it 
all in my mind basically the fear sc yeah well but you had this previous experience already written one 
and that book the universe got its i have said it before and happily say it on tape was 
of my favorite books of all time jl oh i love that sc and a combination of narrative your 
narrative right jl yeah sc which is yet another daring thing to do not supposed to do that as 
scientist with an explication of the science of cosmology and the topology of the universe jl mmhmm that book 
definitely written because i thought we would never know the answer scientifically and so you know sc the answer 
jl whether or not the universe was infinite or finite so this was a question we were asking again 
we could because it the math was fun the math was accessible sc a big question jl a great 
did i honestly at no point working on it scientifically did i think it was gonna be answered observationally 
because what year are we talking here that writing jl oh man like fifteen years ago probably sc early 
jl little after the turn of the early and honestly probably never a question gonna answer the universe could 
finite it could be wrapped onto itself but just so big never see it around and i knew that 
was likely not that i was foolish scientifically thinking we were gonna observe it but the question was fun 
it was fun to do and i think the whole book was about what happens to these ideas if 
measurable and this anxiety about being disconnected not only from other people because what i work on and what 
work on is so weird and difficult to grasp but because it might not even end up in the 
right so basically could these be wasted years i was fantasizing about something real scientifically but not necessarily measurable 
but this was a special case it intrinsically unmeasurable there were for certain answers we could have measured it 
if the universe had been small and topologically interesting and if jl right but if you had put a 
to my head i would have said not that small laughter sc yeah and you would have been right 
would have survived jl and i would have been right sc yes laughter jl i mean there was no 
of me that was pushing it as this is gonna be my big mark in life but it was 
the beauty also and the fascination of talk about narrative the idea that if light wraps around the universe 
can look far enough away and far enough into the past that i could see myself or the milky 
or i could see sean and i studying for physics sc and how the universe got its spots literally 
that is literally how the universe got its spots sc yeah but so at what point do you then 
i mean everyone we know has written a book about cosmology but then you decided to put your personal 
in there right is that something that came in later did you get resistance from your editor and publisher 
yeah i think that that one actually i knew how i wanted to write it because partly at the 
i had no to write a book at that point we come from a field where you can write 
book when coming down from the mountain with the tablet sc right do your thing first jl do your 
first sc do your real work jl come back as a professor emeritus and declare the results and this 
much more we are never gonna have this and so it was sort of turning it on its head 
i so i thought a lot about how i like that tone of know things that i am sharing 
you in my and i think that that contributed to my really negative idea about physics when i was 
kid and scientists when i was a kid is that they simply recite facts or know facts or have 
and that sc so it was therapy writing this book laughter jl well it was definitely like physics is 
not knowing and the fun and the experiment and the experience that leads you to be so lost from 
normal pleasures of life and traveling all the time and separated from your closests and your dearests and so 
think it was much more a clear decision to not write the definitive book of factual information but to 
write about the struggle sc the fact that it was in process was a feature not a bug jl 
sc in progress jl yeah yeah sc but okay but why did you put you into it is this 
because you wanted to reflect the sort of psychological state you were in while doing the research jl you 
i think i was disciplining myself not to sound the word not to sound authoritative i think by choosing 
person to speak to which in this case it was letters to my mom somebody i respect but is 
a physicist that it was a way for me to be respectful to my audience not authoritative sc right 
exactly and to experience that humility of the not knowing and so i think why i chose her as 
target audience and i just thought not just declare that my target audience why pretend otherwise why not just 
writing this to sc do make the subtext text yes jl yes just do it just be blunt and 
think it really helped me find the voice for a first book especially where you struggle to find voice 
yeah and even when books are written not by famous scientists but by journalists or whoever they generally wait 
the result is in hand jl right sc and so there is this idea of a rational reconstruction we 
the story how it makes sense not how it happened jl right okay sc and you got to tell 
story in all the messiness so many mistakes you make and blind alleys you go down jl oh yeah 
yeah actually the last book was so much about that so really funny rai weiss who won the nobel 
along with kip thorne and barry barish for the discovery of gravitational waves kept saying to me when he 
that there was a laughter jl he kept saying what are you gonna do about the sc the book 
wanna write it yeah jl are you gonna do by the and i was like my god rai i 
love to write that the book was about not knowing you know the tension the anxiety the reality of 
like looming palpably sc so the book was about gravitational waves the it was originally about the search for 
waves jl it was about it was originally about the search for gravitational waves sc then turned into the 
of the discovery of gravitational waves jl well only an epilogue sc only in the epilogue jl and again 
way i would i could never had i known about their i mean not sure i could have maintained 
sense of the tension and the anxiety and all of that stuff them climbing mount everest aspect of that 
i know if i could have reproduced if i had known it succeeded sc right jl so it was 
great to write it not knowing if they were gonna succeed that the failure was real and looming as 
real possibility sc but again you threw away tens of thousands of words jl yeah laughter sc how was 
book different in the first conception jl i had a lot more stuff about physics i had a lot 
pedagogical stuff and it and it what i was doing is i was chickening out i was burying these 
because i was really scared to talk about rai and kip sc it never goes away jl and i 
these guys they were really important people to me statesmen of the field and kip especially i became very 
with rai during the writing of the book but known kip since i was what something like that and 
been this wonderful supportive inspiration and to write about him made me incredibly uncomfortable sc because there is dirty 
in the ligo story right jl there is there is sc not all peaches and cream jl not all 
and i was trying to bury it i was chickening out basically and that was a point where my 
dan frank was fantastic i knew i was doing it but i sure if other people would notice sc 
hoped they jl right and dan was like is this he was like pulling your sc why we still 
editors anyway jl and in literally twentyfour hours i threw away half the book and it was so easy 
disconnect it just belong there it was like literally like two disconnected pieces jammed together and i took one 
i threw it away and there was the book sc but it sounds like someday in the future gonna 
jl yeah exposition of black holes sc well and diagonalization theorem of infinity jl right exactly sc like all 
pedagogical things written and never seen the light of day jl right in there i think especially with gödel 
turing that there were better versions written but you know black holes is sort of my thing sc yeah 
i i got a little jive for me and black holes we got something going on assuming go and 
that one sc that would be good jl but you know i have to say the most amazing thing 
both kip and rai is that on the day of the discovery the day that the instruments about which 
was writing and that they designed recorded the first sound of black holes colliding by coincidence i printed a 
of the book one for rai and one for kip and sent it to them and what was amazing 
that neither of them told me not to say something so for instance kip took issue with certain things 
what he did being the scientist all the way through to the very bitter end presented me with all 
evidence of the contrary argument and i included the counter argument but he never said it never said never 
he said instead also the counter sc a true scientist jl a true scientist and rai too rai was 
like it but laughter jl my favourite quote like it but and he said a shame in the public 
but it have to be in your and that quote is in the book laughter sc good good and 
he liked it more jl and he approved the quote yeah laughter exactly sc right having it be that 
jl exactly sc but so your third book was in yet another mode right you had this sort of 
exposition first and then you had a historical novel and in this one almost like the new journalist right 
you are going embedding yourself in the ligo experiment talking to people recording conversations i presume jl yeah that 
i honestly for the first six months i think to record not a journalist laughter jl dummy and then 
was like jesus i gotta start recording this because i was transcribing so frantically afterwards trying to remember exactly 
was said that i i did learn i gotta start to so yes now i record my conversations chuckle 
yeah and so what what did you learned by that experience and what was it like to be a 
jl you know it was i quite enjoyed it i think i have a lot of respect for experiments 
i am notoriously not allowed anywhere near a lab i mean i burn water laughter jl i burn boiling 
frequently so a sense in which like i had a crush on the experiment and it was just this 
homage it was this respect and so the journalism was really pleasurable because it was just observing and i 
remember these funny observations just watching so many of the experimentalists a team and not all of them are 
the ground obviously but no sense of strict hierarchy as though everybody knew what to do and they would 
kind of i said slowly like not space station slowly but this sort of sense of just theirs and 
of people all knowing what to do kind of mindblowing right sc yeah jl and that real they built 
real based on things that we do on paper and that connects and just it has my total admiration 
never stop surprising me but you know jl i mean you know like total admiration and i think that 
of the reasons why i got along with the experimentalists so well is that was so obvious on my 
that i was i was just there laughter sc such a fangirl jl i know i was like such 
fangirl laughter but yeah they did it sc and your journalism just talkinghead interviews you were there at the 
places you visited field work et cetera jl yeah i really think i was trying to write that book 
a novel that was the target the target was rai as a character rai has lines rai says stuff 
dialogue and that it could be fiction for as long as i can maintain it it could literally have 
and read as though rai was a fictitious character with lines and that came from rai that idea because 
speech is so spectacular the rhythm of it chuckle the cadence the swearing chuckle i groomed a lot of 
swearing out which sc oh well the cut will come later yeah laughter jl yeah the and it just 
am it was almost subjournalism i mean i know who am i to tell their story rai tells his 
kip tells his story barry tells his story even robbie vogt who had a very dark relationship with ligo 
the end tells his story and i interpret i sit there and try to say what the truth is 
i simply convey as best that i can what they say so it really should be like a novel 
not a narrator who declares to you what the truth is and real but you get caught up in 
characters and you decide for yourself sc when you write a book like i mean two sides obviously right 
have some standards chuckle sc you wanna write a good book you have a vision but then an audience 
reads it we get a feeling from what saying about how certain circumstances under which just the right thing 
do to tell things in this narrative way rather than a straightforward guidely pedagogical way how does the audience 
it are they outraged that not just giving them the simple drawing of the interferometer jl yes actually oh 
god a good point really funny the biggest complain ever gotten about this book is that it have figures 
it was a really clear decision with dan my editor and i we talked about it if really a 
in that spirit you put pictures in and so can it be conjured up solely with the words and 
think that because people anticipated a nonfiction book they demanded figures it was literally the only complain consistently gotten 
jl and i think we made the right call but i get that it was uncomfortable sc and mostly 
of expectations right not that it work just that i wanted they expected something else jl right these books 
figures why your book have figures and i would say that mostly i feel people really got it i 
the figures aside i get that hard to visualize so i appreciate that there are novels that can put 
in because doing the opposite playing with that sc yeah playing against type jl like dave eggers plays against 
and puts figures in his books i get it totally so this was a call but most people i 
really got it they got that it was a climbing mount everest story they got that it was sort 
a tragic comedy in some sense chuckle occasionally it would be totally misunderstood like somebody would be like if 
you had known they succeeded you would have written a book about and like my god sc yeah you 
you get it jl that you did that you get it and that happens okay sc and we pass 
this without expressing our mutual admiration for the exquisiteness that is the ligo experiment jl it is sc the 
they did this i remember inviting people to give talks just ten years ago and they would give talks 
ligo the update what we wanna do and the audience members who were physics faculty professors were like shaking 
heads like never do jl yeah not gonna happen laughter literally thought the proverbial they we we implicate people 
was fair it was actually fair to be critical of it sc yeah it was not just a few 
people jl no no no these sc a lot of people jl really smart really insightful really thoughtful people 
every reason to believe it would fail and if not the interesting story i know what is but they 
measure the vibration of what is it the mirrors at forty kilograms jesus i should know that i have 
read my own book sc you should read this book i can recommend a good book jl and this 
what happens laughter by less than the width of a proton over four kilometers what a stunning technological sc 
done it several times now jl had it failed if it had failed it would have failed nature provide 
like already established nature love us back sc no jl nature trying to make us feel good sc this 
one of the rare cases where we sort of got lucky right jl yeah sc we were certainly very 
to find something but the things that ligo found were a little bit bigger and more spectacular than we 
expected jl oh yeah i love that i love that out of the gate black holes and the reason 
i called the book hole was rai said to me in august right before the discovery obviously neither of 
knew if we detect black holes this thing is a failure and that is also rai at his most 
he could have been a politician and said as long as we succeeded technologically and as long as we 
neutron stars or blah blah but he he was so honest to the end we do not detect black 
this thing is a so i was like black hole sc so for those of us who read the 
yet i did read the book for those of you out there in podcast land how many years of 
career was rai weiss working on ligo jl probably i would say so he was a young man at 
who also succeeded on other fronts but mostly because they told him not gonna get tenure working on this 
they literally he was building an instrument that was like a meterandahalf in this sc gotta start on your 
jl gotta start somewhere sc yeah on your table jl in this ramshackle structure on a table the now 
kilometers long so he chuckle sc and a billion dollars jl and a billion dollars that a meterandahalf gonna 
it but at the time he was working on this little demo prototype his colleagues were saying things like 
do better looking out the laughter they were like the sun blew up you you hear it with this 
he was like true if the sun blew up i hear it with this like do better looking out 
sc journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step jl so discouraging and what got to love 
rai is that he said gonna spend three years doing an industry study to determine if feasible how big 
expensive what the technological cost and requirements will be to make this so this is fifty years of his 
i mean fifty years of his life and you have to remember and a lot of people think the 
turned on and it was immediately successful well in the year it was running while those black holes that 
detected in two thousand fifteen were colliding they were orbiting each other and it was still too quiet for 
very sophisticated instrument between two thousand and two thousand fifteen to detect anything silence and the gravitational waves were 
and they were washing over the earth and they could not be measured and so to be able to 
to phase two the advanced machine and turn it on and to say two weeks before the detection could 
sc and my understanding is that from the talks i heard some people say that they heard different things 
i heard talks saying that that is exactly what they expected i heard talks saying in other words we 
on ligo we probably see anything but when we turn on advanced ligo we probably jl true yes sc 
to the national science foundation and the government for saying we are gonna give you a billion dollars to 
something that see anything right jl yeah absolutely first generation machine kip and rai and barry were all really 
that they guaranteeing a detection maybe if they were extremely lucky but they absolutely were saying fully anticipate having 
go to a second generation to advanced ligo before make a sc so possible that you have written more 
oriented science physics books than any other person jl laughter i know sc i know i know jl probably 
out there who do does it include people who publish laughter sc yeah well there is that laughter jl 
get a lot of letters sc what the heck so do i jl i think we should start a 
page sc jl for all the people who write us letters sc just to point them in that direction 
yes sc but you know the classic story right i think i heard it attributed to john wheeler where 
would get letters from different crackpots and then he would put them in contact with each other jl oh 
god brilliant sc and he would say you should talk to this and but both of them would come 
and saying did you point me to him a laughter sc crackpotness is not transitive right like they think 
everyone else is also a crackpot except them jl priceless sc it work anyway did we learn something about 
efficacy of this kind of way of talking about science is there something we get science is done by 
beings true but a cliche but true jl yeah sc and you could you could have written books about 
builders or something like that jl i no sorry i want you to finish your thought i think an 
question sc do we learn something specific about the way that science is done that is different and interesting 
telling the stories as stories per se jl i mean to my mind yes and i think that i 
the abstraction of science i love it what moved me when i was frustrated that people were still trying 
figure out what immanuel kant meant it drove me insane because it be locked in one mind it has 
be shareable and there was something about math and physics that is transcendent it belongs to all of us 
is saying did einstein sc nobody learns relativity by reading papers right jl right you learn it because we 
own it as soon as he gave it to us a gift ours a ours we can use it 
a hammer and something about that that just broke my heart when i discovered that when i realized what 
really was when i got away from this negative foolish stereotype of reciting facts when i realized my god 
is a tool been given to me and it belongs to and i think that something about that that 
to our humanity we inherited these concepts these abilities because evolutionarily involved under forces dictated by physics you know 
our minds such a wonderful thing and so i think that to dispel the sense of is solely about 
to realize that this is very much about humanity and something shared and something that could unite us and 
was this moment when they announced the discovery of the gravitational wave detection and i know it was hard 
understand and that people really sure what it was but honestly sure you had a similar experience it was 
the whole world paused sc yeah jl i was i was doing interviews remotely with qatar you know qatar 
qatar jl i apologize for my pronunciation instinctively qatar amazing it was like a moment where we all realized 
a second under the same sky sc yeah yeah i wrote a book about the higgs boson which is 
jl exactly sc discovery of that magnitude had in the last ten years jl exactly sc an international team 
people working together in exquisite harmony jl i think people should think about the nobel peace prize for these 
because they really are internationally transcendent culturally racially religiously transcended experiments that involve the whole world working together on 
completely benign yet what could be more worthy of the nobel peace prize than something like that sc well 
had this quote sadly forget who from but in my book the united nations worked as well as atlas 
cdf collaborations at cern we would have world jl yes and then the irony during my interview with al 
tv was that they were about to ask me and they prepped me they were like gonna ask you 
question about what this means for i had to say something rousing laughter about how all under the same 
and the universe and then they were like sorry we have to take a break for the war in 
jl and i was like damn sc well the skies will still be there tomorrow but the present does 
itself sometimes jl yeah sc i think interesting i forgot to say this is just coming back to something 
but this idea of being a journalist and going in there and doing interviews you said you enjoyed it 
i when i wrote the higgs boson book jl yes you were very journalistic in that book too sc 
was and i like it jl you like it sc i mean married to one of the great science 
so i know how done well jl yes jennifer ouellette sc and i not me right jl yeah sc 
so i said interviewing is not for me and i say this as interviewing you for the podcast so 
happened what went terribly wrong jl chatting sc well no the difference was then i wrote big and again 
interviewed people but i looking for anecdotes and stories i was trying to figure out what they were thinking 
i talked to philosophers and biologists and whatever and that i loved right jl right sc so much better 
i am at caring about the human stories laughter jl i tell you i remember you specifically telling me 
gonna be the one to describe the beard on his face and i had one line about robbie vogt 
is one of my favorite lines on the book if allowed to say that about my own book i 
if that sounds bad but about how he looked at me through wilted orchids because his he had it 
literally like wilted orchids i do like that sc yeah no exactly you have to do what good at 
i recognized my jl yeah right i remember we had this conversation so fascinating sc yeah jl and maybe 
other aspect of journalism i enjoy as much which is really how journalism is written for papers sc no 
tom wolfe hunter s thompson kind jl right yes exactly laughter a long form sc there you are jl 
knows not glad about it it would be so fun to be short form and sc do it jl 
out but i do it long form sc even some of my writer friends i amazed them by saying 
enjoy writing books like me a words ahead of me at my jl that yeah i mean it takes 
a while to do the whole structure and think about what the different architecture of the new book is 
be and always lost in it and it takes me that long to do it how long it takes 
sc but i wanna give you a chance before we go to plug your big i wanna call it 
new project but here in new york and you have this amazing public event series that doing out there 
brooklyn out there in the suburbs jl yeah i love it laughter sc tell us what it is jl 
we are now up at columbia and barnard and i call this upstate manhattan laughter sc here we are 
and i yeah jl in the parks and a sweet hour away which we can take a ferry to 
wall street is pioneer works which is a cultural center in red hook red hook is slightly inaccessible because 
the ground cannot support a subway system so laughter so you have to get there by boat or foot 
bus but it is also a kind of pristine part of new york city because of it and my 
dear dear friend dustin yellin started pioneer works there he bought this old iron works factory from and renovated 
to become a cultural center and the founding artistic director is gabriel florenz just been incredibly visionary and aggressive 
interesting and unafraid and so it started mostly as an art center sc pioneer works jl yeah pioneer works 
we brought science in there now we have a very strong science presence in some sense our science events 
the biggest events we do we we do not fully understand our audience but they come out for it 
been to one of you were in one of my events sc i was jl which was such a 
sc look people love it people love science presented in an accessible way jl people love it they do 
and doing it in a particular way but certainly very accessible jl yeah i think what doing which trying 
understand retroactively is people feel like the scientists are coming to their house okay so free open to the 
and very much in this cultural community center open and welcome and people hang out in the garden and 
stay late and they talk sc and booze jl and booze and food laughter we do popup exhibits a 
of my was like was in the longest beer line and i got to the front and it was 
genetics laughter sc bonus jl yeah exactly so some things making people feel like theirs sc to be fair 
of beer not that of where the beer was coming from jl yes now right we give them genetically 
beer sc they were in the wrong line okay good chuckle jl they were in the wrong line so 
think that right people want it to feel like theirs and so we talk at a really high level 
do sc oh yeah jl and as you know from our event i prep people in part because i 
them to have lectures and i want them sc yes no powerpoint or anything like that jl no powerpoint 
like that and sometimes we have to stop frank wilczek won the nobel prize a good friend of both 
ours who came from mit to give a talk said something like as you all chuckle the higgs field 
sc famous last words jl and i was like sc you do that jl no but okay so we 
and we translate sc right jl but we let frank talk as frank talks sc but a i never 
that idea that part of the charm is the scientist coming to our house another twist on the idea 
telling the human side telling the stories bringing people into our house and i think that and this podcast 
also in the service of the same ideal that there be a dividing line between science and other parts 
human jl right totally sc life whether philosophy or economics or whatever and so this is definitely contributing to 
jl oh thank you for saying that probably the most important philosophy behind pioneer works we come out of 
womb as scientists or artists we come out as both and all things every child palpates the world every 
puts things in their mouth and then tries to figure out what it is and every child develops their 
sense of time and space a forward and a backward these are fascinating revelations that children taught but they 
and every child is an artist and i wanna bring scientists to go be artists professionally not into that 
i bring artists to come i actually like the sciart mix but what i do love is just human 
rubbing elbows and feeling that they live in a bigger world and feeling less isolated sc i think of 
better place to end jl oh lovely sc janna levin thanks so much for being on the podcast jl 
sean fun as always music beautiful work both of you i found this to be a soul soother just 
i needed pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast janna levin on black holes chaos and the narrative of science three
