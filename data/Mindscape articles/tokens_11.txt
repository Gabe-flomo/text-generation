episode transcript sean carroll hello everybody welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today gonna go 
for life elsewhere in the universe i think that with the discovery of many new planets around stars over 
last few decades the idea that there might be life elsewhere in the universe has become more and more 
a scientific project of course always been looking for it been wondering been doing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence 
so forth but now we have a more focused idea of where we might look and a little slightly 
optimistic perspective on how many places there are out there where life could be sc we also talked on 
podcast previously about the idea of the origin of life if life only ever existed on earth then the 
for it elsewhere would not be very helpful but we talked to people like kate adamala to sara imari 
about why life came to exist in the first place today gonna roll up our sleeves a little bit 
think about looking for life and one thing to look for extraterrestrial intelligence very very far away today gonna 
about looking for actual living beings here in our solar system people of a certain age namely my age 
of age in the time when we were looking for life on the surface of mars with the viking 
in the it was very exciting but also a little bit inconclusive we find any life mars is a 
dry planet and these days we talk a lot about whether or not mars might have had life in 
past less so about whether it has life now sc but get the wrong idea because other places here 
the solar system where life really could exist and we are actually going to go look for it guest 
kevin hand who is deputy chief scientist for solar system exploration at the jet propulsion laboratory here in pasadena 
kevin is educated in physics and geology and biology and astronomy and planetary science and all of these things 
engineering he brings them together both thinking about what life might be and how it might arise and how 
might actually build something to go look for it his special focus has been on europa the moon of 
but he also thinks about enceladus and triton and titan and other places in the solar system typically moons 
giant planets where you can get oceans underneath giant sheets of ice which might be just the right conditions 
life to form sc kevin has a new book out called alien oceans which is exactly about this topic 
for life here in the solar system probably not technologically advanced life get too excited but very very plausible 
microscopic or primitive forms of life could exist elsewhere in our backyard and very exciting to think that gonna 
look for them i wanted to mention very briefly that we have a patreon here for the mindscape podcast 
can find links to it on the podcast webpage or just at patreoncomseanmcaroll but we also do for the 
supporters they get ad free versions of the podcast and also a monthly ask me anything episode and now 
the ask me anything episodes go public this was a vote taken by the patreon supporters so only patreon 
can actually ask questions but everyone can hear the answers sc so i will put these on youtube and 
the actual patreon post where my with the episode with my answers is put becomes public a few days 
everybody after i post it at the beginning of the month for the patreon supporters so check that out 
check out the video series that i am doing called the biggest ideas in the universe where once a 
i tackle a big idea talk about it in hopefully a compelling informal chatty kind of way then a 
of days later do a qa video about that so a lot going on here at a time when 
of us are locked down looking for things to do trying to provide content for everybody so your minds 
you gotta be thinking you gotta be moving forward brain wise in this time of quarantine and with that 
music sc kevin hand welcome to the mindscape podcast kevin hand thank you sean good to see you sc 
heard that you just got back from antarctica and did you find life in antarctica kh plenty of life 
not that hard really not really giving yourself a challenge here kh right right sc why were you there 
so our team was testing out and deploying this under ice robotic vehicle that is something that jpl has 
in as sort of a winwin robotic capability that can be used to study ocean and cryosphere ice while 
building some of the capabilities that someday we hope to deploy beneath the ice of a world like moon 
sc okay so there at a place where there is ice on top of water and sending it into 
right sea ice around antarctica sc is this something where the thing you were dealing with had a capability 
digging through the ice or did you kh no not there yet sc okay kh someday we will have 
robot encased in another robot and that other robot will have the job of getting through the ice sc 
you gonna put the whole thing on a rocket send it to europa kh send it to europa but 
doing what i just described getting through ice even thin the ice that we were dealing with in antarctica 
at the australian antarctic casey they were great partners that ice is just about in thickness at least when 
were there sc nothing kh nothing except to get through that ice and then deploy our robotic vehicle takes 
saws and ice clippers and all sorts of things and projects that work to get through even thicker ice 
earth use hot water drills and just thousands upon thousands of kilograms to get through the ice before you 
even start to sample beneath the ice and so as you can imagine if our dream of dreams is 
someday get through the ice of europa and directly study that ocean and whatever may be alive within it 
a long way go chuckle kh and so this sc how thick is the ice we think on europa 
kh well a huge debate there are the thin shellists and the thick shellists i happen to be on 
thin shell side sc but you kinda gotta plan for a thick shell if sending up a spacecraft chuckle 
to be clear by thin i mean about call it five kilometers in thickness sc right chuckle kh so 
pretty darn thick sc more than one hundred eighty centimeters kh yeah exactly not gonna chainsaw through that sc 
kh so by earth so the antarctic ice sheet above lake vostok which is one of these subglacial lakes 
the continent of antarctica the ice above lake vostok is about four kilometers in thickness sc okay kh and 
would be considered thin ice on europa sc right kh and we even really access these subglacial lakes in 
easily sc even with all of our human capability of flying down there and having people and yeah kh 
tractors full of devices to hotwater drill etcetera sc so this is depressing me this is making me think 
less likely than i imagined to easily just dig down into oceans chuckle kh welcome to my world sc 
okay kh not for the faint of heart sc so just the audience here we presume they know anything 
all so get to what europa is and why interesting but is there a mission planned to go do 
or is this just planning for a future far off things kh well so there is a mission that 
has committed to call the europa clipper mission and that mission is a flyby mission it will orbit jupiter 
fly by europa some fortyfive or more and with each flyby some of which may be fewer than one 
kilometers above with each flyby it will collect incredible imagery spectroscopy got an icepenetrating radar instrument on it to 
sound into the ice and so got all sorts of great ways of looking at surface looking into interior 
out the surface chemistry the surface geology and some of the interior geophysics and from a remotesensing mission a 
flying by sc right kh that mission does not have any lander on it part of the clipper mission 
much of what i focus on at jpl is the next step trying to get a lander down to 
surface of europa or for that matter enceladus a moon of saturn that is also incredibly compelling in the 
of alien oceans beyond earth and places where we could go to not just find evidence of life but 
extant life life that is alive today sc not just fossils kh not just fossils and incredibly important in 
of revolutionizing our understanding of biology sc sure do we know for sure that there are oceans beneath the 
on surface kh well you of course know that needs to be in quotes but based on the available 
we can make the prediction that the best hypothesis to explain the available evidence is that europa does have 
salty subsurface liquid water ocean and that evidence i like to kind of partition into three easy pieces sc 
kh kind of taking a page out of six easy pieces right chuckle kh and the first easy piece 
use spectroscopy to figure out that the surface of europa is covered in water ice sc uhhuh rather than 
or kh or rocks or whatever right think about it galileo turns this military tool the telescope to the 
sky looks at the moon looks at venus looks at jupiter and sees jupiter and also sees these four 
points of light which to him at the time he thought were just sc stars what else could they 
kh right yeah and galileo being a clever fellow named them the stars of medici because of course where 
money was coming from kh you would name them the stars of nasa where your coming from chuckle kh 
as we know he mapped those little points of light around jupiter night after night and discovered that they 
fact revolve around jupiter which at the time was heretical and got him in trouble with the spanish inquisition 
through his diligent observations we came to appreciate that jupiter has moons now those little points of light stayed 
points of light for some three hundred fifty years until astronomers like kuiper and vasilli moroz a russian astronomer 
spectroscopy to figure out that the surface of europa was made of water ice so the first easy piece 
we go from a point of light to europa having an icy surface sc right kh the next easy 
i like to make the analogy to babysitting a space craft sc okay kh what do i mean by 
sc something all done chuckle kh so babysitting a space craft well here on earth we use the deep 
network this network of antennas three of which are antennas to get the data back from spacecraft and to 
commands up to spacecraft the dsn is used for all missions and along with collecting and transmitting data from 
various spacecraft the signals that are received can be used to look at the tiny red and blue shifts 
doppler shifts associated with those signals sc sure kh and phenomenally this never ceases to amaze me with the 
spacecraft as it was flying by europa the beautiful little gravity and you know the expert on all of 
and then the fabric of space and time laughter kh but got its own little gravity well and as 
spacecraft flies by interior mass distribution and its rotation cause slight accelerations and deceleration which appear as millimeterpersecond doppler 
in the signal being sent back to earth sc so not a point mass we kh right and not 
is it not a point mass but by merit of looking at the gravity signal of europa in other 
the doppler shift as the galileo spacecraft flew by scientists on the galileo mission were able to tease out 
moment of inertia of europa sc wait sorry looking at the doppler shift of the spacecrafts kh sending its 
back to earth sc okay but influenced by europa and because europa is not a point mass it has 
shape kh right a shape sc it is not a perfect sphere what you can look at kh and 
density sc right kh right and so the rotation plus the nonuniform density puts its fingerprint on the doppler 
of the spacecraft as it flies by and then you can invert that information about the gravity structure of 
to get things like the moment of inertia from which you can then build layered models sc so you 
such and such rock such and such water such and such ice kh exactly so the second piece of 
puzzle is that the gravity data those doppler shifts necessitate that europa at least in kind of a threelayer 
has a dense core iron or iron sulfur a rocky silicate mantle and then some outer layer of roughly 
hundred to possibly two hundred kilometers in thickness of low density material and in particular the density that fits 
gravity data well is something in the range of one gram per cubic centimeter sc also the density of 
glasses of water in front of us right now kh exactly right and so the second piece of the 
follows on the first the first says you know that europa is covered in ice the second piece of 
puzzle tells you that water in some phase be it liquid or solid extends down for one hundred to 
hundred kilometers now the gravity data was not of sufficient sensitivity to differentiate between the density of water and 
density of ice sc sure a miracle they could do anything at all astronomers are just geniuses at taking 
tiniest bit of data and stringing a tale based on this kh oh remarkable sc remarkable yeah kh but 
always feel compelled to point out we scientists often have the easy part of the job is the engineers 
really make this possible they make the data possible without their precision you get that millimeter per second velocity 
that able to measure so the second piece of the puzzle not yet at an ocean that requires the 
piece of the puzzle a liquid water ocean a salt water ocean sc right because given the first two 
it could just be all ice kh right exactly so a third piece of the puzzle i like to 
the analogy to adhering to airport security sc okay kh what the heck do i mean by that sc 
do you mean chuckle kh so for the moment disregard those big cylinders that we sometimes now have to 
in and you know we feel like being zapped in a thousand ways go back to those doorways the 
metal detectors when at an airport and walking through one of those doorway structures passing through a pulsating timevarying 
field that timevarying magnetic field gives rise to electric currents in any conductor that you might have in your 
or on your person those induced electric currents as we know from faraday and enm those induced electric currents 
rise to induced magnetic fields and within the little doorway there are sensors to detect induced magnetic fields so 
walk through with a conductor in your pocket that gives rise to induced electric currents which gives rise to 
magnetic fields and the alarm goes off sc yeah all been there kh all been there then you get 
patdown you miss your flight laughter kh so with the galileo spacecraft the alarm went off the galileo spacecraft 
on board a magnetometer a fancy compass and as it flew by europa it detected an induced magnetic field 
had long been measuring the galileo spacecraft had long been measuring magnetic field and from that data we knew 
magnetic field is tilted by nearly ten degrees sc from rotational axis kh exactly and so if europa magnetic 
has a timevarying component so the galileo spacecraft had mapped that out reasonably well and as it flew by 
on a handful of occasions it detected an induced magnetic field what the heck could be giving rise to 
induced magnetic field europa did not have a standard dipole the way the earth does it did not have 
intrinsic field it had this induced field well you could say maybe the time varying component of magnetic field 
interacting with iron core a good conductor sc yep that makes sense that will be my answer yeah kh 
off the alarm well you do the math and the modeling and i did a lot of this a 
of years ago and tried to fit things the core is just too small and too far away sc 
kh what about that rocky mantle turns out that rocks silicon rocks are not conductive enough to explain the 
but what fits the induced magnetic field data of europa beautifully is a nearsurface conducting layer now from piece 
one and piece number two we know that that nearsurface region of europa is water in some phase sc 
kh and so the best answer to the induced magnetic field data at europa is a salty liquid water 
the salt provides the conductivity that sc water by itself would not work but salty water would work kh 
by yeah sc and liquid water is better than ice kh right yeah you can kind of play around 
some mushy ice scenarios but even in that essentially at an ocean anyway sc i mean both remarkable that 
can say all that about a little dot in the sky the galileo looking in his telescope also very 
that we could be wrong chuckle sc right like you said we never know for sure a lot of 
evidence but presumably the clipper will give us much more evidence kh right sc what year is that coming 
well so hopefully the mission will get to the launch pad in the two thousand twentythree to two thousand 
timeframe sc okay kh either launch would hopefully get us out to joi jupiter orbit insertion and ultimately flybys 
europa in the late sc okay kh and a lot of that uncertainty is in what launch vehicle we 
go on sc but it could be roughly five years to get there kh yeah on the low end 
to three and a half four on the higher end closer to six and a half seven sc yeah 
and then the lander say that everything works and you get the lander you get the money you get 
launch date when would that be arriving at jupiter kh ahh sc this is your baby right this is 
thing you should know you should have a quick snappy answer to this chuckle kh sadly sadly there is 
plan for a europa landing right now sc okay but say the kh right sc would be okay kh 
yeah sc and even that does not have a drill gonna go through the ice gonna land on the 
kh right so the pathway is flyby land and then get deeper into the subsurface before we can do 
melt probe or something that gets into the ocean directly we need to do a lot of ground truth 
directly get onto the surface of a world like europa or enceladus to see how hard that surface is 
it takes to drill or melt into it how thick the ice truly is in the region of where 
wanna someday go through and i should say that as great as the remote sensing will be the clipper 
is a habitability mission be able to further constrain the ocean the ocean chemistry the ice shell chemistry and 
geology but unless europa is extraordinarily generous with her chuckle sc which nature sometimes is not chuckle kh right 
going to find signs of life with a remote sensing mission sc sure kh to detect biosignatures you need 
get on the surface sc i mean there is a theory that at least some people have that you 
detect really really complex molecules and even if you know that they had some particular biological function you might 
no nonorganic way of making them is that something feasible with just the clipper kh true and so clipper 
on board two very capable mass spectrometers one of which a coinvestigator on and these are really exciting instruments 
we hope to fly similar instruments through the plumes of enceladus someday and in both case whether flying through 
plumes of enceladus or perhaps plume on europa instruments such as those mass spectrometers could give us an inventory 
organic compounds carbon compounds that provide compelling evidence for a highly selective process that might point to biology sc 
kh because really at the end of the day biology is selective and abiotic processes for generating carbon compounds 
not so you basically go from a poisson distribution to a picket fence sc sorry this is your fancy 
way of saying if not organic you get a lot of light tiny kh if not biological sc if 
biological sorry i used organic in the casual way but you scientists just mean carbon when you say organic 
understand kh yeah sc carbon chemistry so if not kh but there is a nuance there carbon dioxide of 
is carbon chemistry and not organic so lots sc yeah okay hydrocarbon chemistry these scientists man this is why 
wanna have scientists on my podcast just too picky chuckle but anyway you could imagine lots of sort of 
crazy nonbiological chemical reactions that would occasionally spit out a long molecule but only in the presence of many 
tiny molecules kh right sc whereas a truly biological thing might give you this anomalously large concentration of really 
molecules kh and coupled with that so life as we know really hard to pin down some of the 
of life as we know what do we think would be universal for the most part the community biologists 
etcetera a general convergence on biology however you frame it is selective it will form larger molecules by utilizing 
pool of smaller subunits in the case of life on earth that is for proteins amino acids sc proteins 
dna kh right exactly sc not randomly chosen collections of carbon molecules yeah laughter kh right and so if 
take rna dna proteins and just break them up going to see a pattern that has a fundamental unit 
on say amino acids linked together one two three so on and so forth right so just not a 
smatter sc yeah kh now back to the alien oceans and having missions that could fly through plumes on 
or enceladus absolutely there could be some incredibly compelling evidence but even after that gonna wanna land chuckle yeah 
oh yeah no then you wanna land more than ever right true kh and with those chemical analyses not 
gonna see the life not gonna be able to put that under a microscope until you get down on 
surface and grab a scoop of it and one of the things that makes me nervous about depending on 
for analyzing say plume material is the small quantities that you actually get as you fly through a plume 
when we talk about flying through a plume on enceladus or europa not like flying through old faithful up 
yellowstone or sc right with the fires here in la kh right or even a snow making machine at 
ski resort these plumes at the flybyaltitudes say fifty kilometers or so very diffuse and so collecting nano leaders 
on a good day micro leaders of sample whereas if on the surface collecting a full scoop worth of 
sc and hard to know what you found i mean i was a kid you were a kid when 
viking landers landed on mars and we all thought they were gonna tell us whether there was life and 
did some chemistry experiments and the answer is maybe some hints but we kh however so the viking was 
phenomenal mission sc in the oh my goodness kh in the so i like to compare the viking missions 
the incredible achievement of the viking missions the sort of robotic pioneering work that was done in the that 
analogous to putting humans on the moon sc yeah kh right a miracle that nasa did that back in 
day when it comes to viking and life detection a really important nuance that often gets lost in the 
and when i talk about europa lander viking often gets thrown back at me from the naysayers who like 
or who like the search for life they say know what looking for and the viking failed and it 
the mars program for that is a tremendously false read of history for a number of different reasons but 
really important to appreciate is that the viking biology payload was largely designed to look for living microbes sc 
kh microbes that were cooking along living and breathing sc metabolising eating and drinking yeah kh metabolising exactly right 
so the viking lander again miraculously scooped up some sample poured it into a little agar plates little sugar 
essentially and did a host of different experiments looking at consumption of gases release of gases some of the 
were isotropically labeled but all of those results required microbes to actually be living and metabolising and as we 
hard to do even in the lab sc yeah kh and so it was a tremendous achievement but the 
in which we search for biology now is to look for the chemistry of life the structures of life 
on viking the measurement the instrument that kind of put to rest some of the ambiguous results about the 
experiments was the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer which did not detect any organic compounds at the level of parts 
billion and so the conventional wisdom is if you got any carbon you got life sc yeah kh at 
in terms of searching for life as we know it and so the gcms results superseded any ambiguity on 
biology result sc but this gets into what i really wanted to use this opportunity for is to talk 
what life is or might be i mean looking for life in the solar system we know a lot 
what it is previously on the podcast had kate adamala talking about making synthetic life in the lab we 
sara walker talking about what life is from the information theory perspective get down and dirty with like the 
and what might be going on so how do you conceptualize what life might be when imagining what we 
do to look for it kh yeah a great question with a myriad of ways to answer it and 
and foremost when it comes to searching for signs of life be it on mars within alien oceans in 
outer solar system on europa enceladus titan etcetera or on extrasolar planets or with seti signals i think really 
to not get too precious about life what do i mean by that the search for life comes under 
scrutiny sometimes very valuable scrutiny but oftentimes that scrutiny is disproportionate to the way in which other scientific questions 
under scrutiny and in part because we i think imbue this question with a certain amount of preciousness sc 
well we take the answer seriously but look certainly someone who thinks that both the investigation of how life 
and our search for it is way underfunded and emphasized within the scientific community kh excellence chuckle sc preaching 
conversion an official mindscape position that we should spend more money and effort understanding where life came from kh 
yeah right but let me give you an example in geology the question what is a mineral sc yeah 
but fine still operationally building instruments kh right sc you need an answer even if not the perfect answer 
right so if we can remove sort of the precious layer of how we think about life and biology 
we get to some operational approaches and fundamentally life is a layer on top of geology life alleviates chemical 
in the environment to accelerate the increase in entropy and i need to tell you that chuckle sc we 
increasing entropy our favorite thing kh but to that end life does it in a very chemically specific way 
harnessing the energy available in chemical systems to do work sc the free energy as we said kh that 
free energy exactly sc yes right yeah kh and so sc and that sorry you and i know what 
means but just to be clear very roughly speaking for those of you read eternity to you know that 
a system has energy you can roughly divide it into useful energy and useless energy right the useless energy 
just all entropy and temperature the useful energy that you can do work with the free energy talking about 
kh right and it gives free so josiah willard gibbs huge fan one of these vastly underappreciated physicists sc 
of the first great american scientists also kh oh and can we divert into gibbs sc yeah no these 
are free kh so yeah gibbs just vastly underappreciated incredibly humble and just lived a very simple life at 
none of as much as i love einstein einstein sort of established the crazy physicist archetype right sc he 
yeah kh and so some of that persists and in order to be a genius and brilliant you must 
something weird about you laughter if not the crazy hair you must have crazy tattoos etcetera etcetera and to 
so artificial gibbs was just an ordinary guy with great thoughts and so i find very refreshing to read 
gibbs sc well and still thinking about the significance of these concepts for ideas like the origin of life 
you can kh yeah sc and i will agree that it makes sense that one of the things life 
is turn this free energy into higher entropy energy not completely clear that laws law of physics that says 
that should happen or under what condition it would happen or is it probable so what we have to 
of empirically figure out kh right and so yeah dive into gibbs free energy for a minute so as 
said you can think about energy in a couple of different ways the heat and change in entropy get 
done with that chuckle and then the work and oftentimes when we think about work we think of pdv 
and change in volume sc a piston pushing it in there it pushes back doing work yeah kh yeah 
or to go to physics we can think of work as force times distance sc mmhmm kh and force 
course is ma or mg in the case of planet earth and so when we think about the work 
we can think of mgh mass times the gravitational acceleration times the height to which you hold sc lift 
yeah kh drop it well gibbs had this great insight in that within chemical systems there should be some 
equivalent to mechanical work and that chemical equivalent comes with something like chemical potential sc right kh and that 
potential times the change in mass of a given compound within a system yields you some of that energy 
to do work sc so can we think of this as if you have hydrogen and oxygen in a 
it has the ability to light on fire and do some work kh right and so brilliance so entropy 
how do you think about aggregations where do things aggregate and gibbs obsessed over this he thankfully so sc 
for us kh clausius and boltzmann etcetera had preceded him and so he basically said this aggregation and the 
and volume changes missing a certain aspect of how we do the fullcost accounting for energy and changes in 
and gibbs said you know what if i have something like hydrogen and oxygen these two and he loved 
use this term so are these new parts that get created from old parts so hydrogen and oxygen come 
to make water and so in any given system you might have the initial parts some compounds and then 
the end you have new parts and so his addition to the energy equation which folds into gibbs free 
is that chemical potential for each compound for each chemical in that system to then react with other compounds 
to form new parts so he really helped complete the full accounting for the conservation of energy sc okay 
we gotta get from here to life somehow chuckle kh okay right so sc i gave you that digression 
kh but beautiful physics it sc beautiful physics and i love it and i could go on kh okay 
back to life and why the heck life arises and here talking just about life as a chemical system 
yep kh certainly there is life in silico all sorts of kind of broader ways yeah sc artificial versions 
yeah but strictly speaking for life as a chemical process that we currently call biology i think it is 
you allow me to use a loaded term i think it is motivated by that requirement of the universe 
increase entropy and in so doing alleviate chemical disequilibrium in the environment sc yeah kh and so any place 
got gibbs free energy available enzymes and how you get to an enzyme is tricky but enzymes allow you 
overcome a bit of a hump to then release that stored chemical energy sc right metaphorically like the spark 
could light the hydrogen and oxygen on fire right kh right sc some ability for entropy to increase lurking 
in the chemicals all around you but you have to allow it to get there somehow and that kind 
enzymatic process is what saying leads to life is life is life adjacent chuckle kh right and so there 
numerous hypotheses for the origin of life itself but i think one of the most compelling suspects in the 
of how life arose perhaps on earth and perhaps elsewhere is the reduction of carbon dioxide how do you 
carbon dioxide and pull off the oxygens and do something else with it sc mmhmm kh and sometimes this 
into the acetylcoa pathway that is part of modern biology sc take your word for that chuckle kh but 
on minerals may have been the sort of first catalytic environment that where kind of the protoenzymes that allowed 
the reduction of things like carbon dioxide to then form organic compounds and then to be a template for 
and eventually the formation of vesicles that would some day be called cells sc yeah i mean i wanna 
too deeply into this we gotta talk about various moons in the solar system kh right sc but maybe 
quick overview of metabolism replication compartmentalization the most important ingredients for life kh so well so a metabolism firster 
i think and where gibbs free energy comes into play you need a motivation for the energy dynamics of 
sc why you tell us the opposing school of thought kh well i think so much opposing just a 
of different camps are trying to figure out where the intersection of metabolism information storage and current compartmentalization all 
together sc everyone agrees you need these three things kh exactly sc people put different emphases on what is 
crucial step kh right sc but replication and information seems to me from my reading of the community to 
the thing that most people are focusing on whereas saying a metabolism kind of guy kh right now the 
molecule side what many of us like to call the top down side kind of lowhanging fruit we have 
information molecules sc we know what rna and dna are in us now right kh and so we can 
at the rna world the idea that the earliest information molecule was some form of rna or polynucleic acids 
etcetera but the ladder down stops at those pnas sc to you mean down to simpler and simpler things 
on kh right right so a top down approach you can climb all the way down to polynucleic acids 
variations there in but how do you actually bootstrap sc where do you get them from just from chemicals 
around in a warm small pond kh exactly right and so as much as i love the millerurey sc 
were kh yeah getting amino acids and then some more complex compounds from a spark discharge experiment that had 
pretty simple compounds like methane and water and ammonia in it you then get amino acids and some of 
building blocks of life amazing right just mind blowing back in the sc this is the and so yeah 
as i recall that was basically the conclusion is not that hard to make amino acids out of random 
kh right sc and they thought yeah tomorrow do proteins and then do dna but that just turned out 
be kh further along a little mouse is gonna run out of the lab sc yeah exactly much harder 
right and that from that progression in the to now where of course had the genetic revolution leslie orgel 
others really spearheaded the rna world and that was phenomenal work and in going back to viking right so 
year after viking lands hydrothermal vents are discovered sc here on earth kh here on earth sc not on 
mars chuckle kh no right chuckle more europa for them right sc yeah kh but so much happened in 
late just one of my favorite scientific periods so hydrothermal vents are discovered sc under the oceans tell us 
a hydrothermal vent is why we care kh right so hot springs at the bottom of the ocean new 
crusts is forming or fractures in the oceanic crust are allowing chemical reactions to proceed that drive hot water 
all sorts of interesting chemistry and so part of what was exciting about the discovery of the hydrothermal vents 
that along with the astonishing ecology the biology that was found there the tube worms the zoarcid fish the 
etcetera these also started to become recognized as cauldrons for interesting mineralogical and potentially organic chemistry to serve as 
place where processes perhaps related to the origin of life could occur sc and part of that is simply 
is dynamical you not gonna imagine the lifeforms in something just sitting there stationary you need some shakeup something 
is knocking things around and hopefully falling into good patterns kh right and one of the things that i 
like about the hydrothermal vents model for the origin of life is motivated by a metabolismfirst approach got compounds 
out the fluids are full of things like hydrogen and methane compounds that have electrons they just wanna give 
sc energy kh energy coming back to gibbs free energy and there are minerals that also want to give 
electrons and the ocean around it wants to accept those electrons so a lot of really compelling chemistry that 
around hydrothermal vents the downside and the argument often put against hydrothermal vents is all that damn water laughter 
and water is not deadly kh right well but it is to certain chemical reactions so when you link 
amino acids together that process that polymerization spits out a water molecule so if linking two amino acids together 
a liquid water environment trying to introduce a new water molecule into a place full of water molecules not 
advantageous sc right kh chemistry like to proceed in that direction sc yeah kh and where many of my 
who do brilliant work on like in warm tide pools on the flanks of some ancient continent where you 
lap up some primordial soup and then it gets baked in the sun and desiccated that desiccation process a 
better environment for concentrating things and linking things together sc and they showed it on star trek that that 
how life formed here on earth kh so it must be true sc yeah chuckle kh right now so 
there are different camps as far as informationfirst metabolismfirst compartmentalization and then layered on top of there is a 
diagram of environments that we see here on earth hydrothermal vents tide pools hot springs and other things what 
find so exciting about these alien oceans beyond earth these worlds like europa enceladus and titan is that we 
just do this experiment sc yeah kh right sc well done it a handful of times put it that 
right kh what do you mean done it though sc indeed the solar system has done it kh oh 
right so the solar system is running these experiments sc yeah kh we can go into our own backyard 
own solar system backyard and just look in the ice and in the oceans of these ocean worlds of 
outer solar system and say you got life life originate and i do think these worlds are great places 
second independent origins of life sc so let me see if i have the picture we know that certain 
are necessary the compartmentalization the replication the metabolism we know all necessary but we know the order or what 
to what or anything like that various hypotheses and part of the problem is even though we have a 
of life currently on earth and even very simple organisms still a stretch to say what the first organisms 
like right kh right sc we definitely say that so if we were able to look at other environments 
there was also the possibility of these things going on we could learn a lot kh right and this 
oh just beautiful we have a chance to look at what is contingent and what is convergent in biochemical 
is dna rna and protein chemistry the only game in town if you run the clock again does biochemistry 
on that solution sc so the answer kh we gotta go to europa sc no but what do you 
do you think that dna is necessary for life kh so what i can say with confidence i love 
i love doing mars exploration a beautiful world sc but kh but there are two things first and foremost 
search for life on mars is primarily a search for life in the past as preserved in the rock 
and sc because there was running water on mars but not now kh right mars had a wet and 
past and warmer past and we think that mars was definitely habitable and i for one think that mars 
likely had life based on what i know of life on earth i would predict that if the origin 
life is sc a big if yeah okay kh big if right but if you grant me that then 
had life and there should be evidence of life on mars sc yes i would argue that we have 
zero information about whether it was easy or hard kh one hundred percent sc because our existence does not 
kh right but the best way to turn that from zero to nonzero sc right look somewhere else for 
exactly sc right okay but you did you say you bet that mars probably had life kh right sc 
you we have a lot of evidence that it had the conditions kh right now the problem is say 
go to mars and we find some beautiful rocks and beautiful stromatolites rocks that preserve perhaps the microbial fabric 
fossils dna rna large information molecules do not last for a long time in the rock record now in 
subsurface of mars there could be living life and i would be thrilled to go and explore mars for 
but even if we found dna based life on mars razor would still tell me quite count on that 
a second because earth and sc too close kh too close neighbours planetary buddies just sending stuff back and 
sc swapping bodily fluids kh yep throwing the baseball asteroid impacts ejecting stuff sc and in fact we have 
from mars here on earth and people look for evidence of life in them kh exactly this just speculation 
actually have examples the outer solar system is much harder to say contaminate with earth rocks or mars rocks 
so if we went to europa or enceladus or a titan with a robotic vehicle and we found dna 
life that to me would strongly point to a second independent origin with a convergent biochemical evolution towards dna 
that is would be phenomenal sc can you name at least one plausible alternative to dna kh no sc 
okay kh i wish i could sc but we admit that that might just be our lack of imagination 
right now steve benner in florida has done some beautiful experiments on adding additional base pairs so there are 
interesting synthetic biology experiments that have been done sc heard about that i think that kate adamala also talked 
this yeah kh yeah sc so the the gcta might not be the whole alphabet kh right not the 
alphabet in terms of you can push at least in the lab the dna molecule to have added base 
is that biologically acceptable sc yeah kh we know those experiments it gone from cool chemistry to actual biology 
really compelling sc okay so we will at least have the ability to so one thing that we could 
obviously the fact that if we learn that life elsewhere the big thing the second thing is it dna 
similar kind of chemistry sure that some people in the audience are thinking it too cold out there to 
life way beyond the orbit of kh yeah yeah yeah sc are we even talking about these moons not 
the goldilocks kh right so this comes back to the fundamental game changing aspect of these ocean worlds beyond 
europa ganymede callisto three moons of jupiter titan and enceladus two moons of saturn and even curious moon triton 
are worlds where liquid water is maintained and sustained in large part through tidal dissipation tidal energy pumping and 
and then heating these worlds from the interior sc but these moons are orbiting gihumongous planets kh exactly so 
knows and loves the tides on earth on europa dealing with europa is about the size of our moon 
europa is orbiting jupiter which is some three hundred eighteen times as massive as the earth and just getting 
and squeezed like a ball of taffy and the predictions are that if you stood on europa you might 
and fall in the diurnal cycle the daily up and down which is equivalent to earth days you might 
and fall with the tides about thirty meters or nearly one hundred ft per europan day sc alright so 
your dramamine if gonna visit europa kh exactly sc but yeah injecting a lot of energy into the ice 
would almost crazy to think that some of it heat up and make a liquid water kh right so 
traditional habitable zone the way we normally thought about planets in the early days of astronomy and planetary science 
that the habitable zone is defined by the distance from your parent star and habitability was conceived of as 
a liquid water ocean on your planet surface in contact with a nice atmosphere and then off to the 
sc yeah kh and in that kind of conception of the habitable zone you had this at least in 
solar system goldilocks scenario where venus earth and mars were kind of like those little bowls of porridge in 
goldilocks story venus is too close to the sun gets too much energy any water that it once had 
baked out too hot mars too far away too cold any water that it once had froze up now 
story of venus and mars is much more complicated sc it turned out to be more complicated matter kh 
and they at points in the past did have liquid water but at least in the modern epic planet 
is in that goldilocks zone where it has liquid water on the surface in contact with our nice thick 
and the reason we have that ocean our ocean is because of energy from the sun from our parent 
kh what these ocean worlds of the outer solar system are teaching us is that another way to get 
business of maintaining and sustaining liquid water done tidal energy dissipation in part coupled with radiogenic decay in other 
the decay of heavy elements uranium thorium even potassium provide enough internal heat so as to keep some liquid 
liquid and on europa we think that the tidal energy dissipation could lead to an ocean a global liquid 
ocean of some one hundred kilometers in depth sixty miles in depth ten times the depth of the mariana 
the deepest region in our own ocean and so that tidal energy is really changing the way we think 
habitable environments in our own solar system sc would it almost always be the case that throughout the universe 
just the solar system as we know it these kinds of so basically two possibilities one is heated by 
star and like the earth the other is a satellite of a giant planet and regardless of what the 
is doing heated by these tidal stresses kh yeah sc would those would that second option always come with 
ice sheet around it kh yeah so for the most part and the answer is yes get to titan 
a second titan also has an atmosphere but i do wanna give the heavy elements the credit that due 
radiogenic decay can last for a long time pluto and still kinda understanding pluto as this beautiful dynamic world 
cares if a planet or a dwarf planet or what have you i just love it as a world 
may well have a liquid water ocean perhaps with some ammonia or other antifreeze mixed in and if pluto 
in fact have a liquid water ocean it is sustained through the trickling out of heat from the decay 
these heavy radiogenic elements kh coupled with that interesting thermal physics associated with ice shells all of these ocean 
rely on ice being a good insulator ice is a great blanket but there are different kinds of ice 
serve as better blankets than others so on europa enceladus ice one ice that we can grab out of 
freezer the sort of traditional ice and if ever built a snow fort or walked into an igloo or 
like that you know that you can actually stay pretty warm if surrounded by frozen water sc told that 
snow that does the insulating not the ice kh well yes but even ice sc my vast igloo experience 
in here kh yes so snow the porous material is definitely better but even ice sc okay gotcha kh 
not a tremendously good conductor of heat but then this other aspect clathrates so a kind of ice that 
to trap various molecules clathrate means cage or to encage and so on pluto the ice of pluto the 
ice is mixed with nitrogen and methane and perhaps some ammonia and stuff and that mixture may help pluto 
a better thermal insulation to keep its ocean sc there could be life on pluto is what you telling 
kh well so sc if we let ourselves dream a little bit chuckle kh right right so no chuckle 
cause i saw the and episode very upset that been demoted from planet status laughter kh ooh not seen 
so where pluto kind of falls short is the way i like to frame this is the keystones for 
are you need liquid water you need the elements to build life and to the best of our knowledge 
as we know it at least needs a smattering of fiftyfour elements from the periodic table the most significant 
which are the chnops the carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur then you need iron and some heavy 
then the third key stone is you need some energy and that comes back to gibbs free energy you 
some chemical disequilibrium kh europa and enceladus and perhaps even titan i think satisfy those three keystones i think 
oceans of europa and enceladus are mixing with a rocky sea floor that rocky sea floor gives rise potentially 
hydrothermal vents which gives rise to the elements needed to build life and the energy needed to power life 
might have a lot of the compounds and water needed for satisfying the liquid water keystone and potentially the 
keystone methane as i mentioned is a good molecule and so life could eat or make that but part 
what i worry about with pluto is whether or not got enough of the heavy elements whether or not 
sc so tiny kh yeah sc yeah kh but its density is sufficient to indicate that gotta be some 
for action sc you seem to hint that titan was a weirdo also kh titan is my favorite place 
search for weird life sc weird life kh life unlike life as we sc i wanna qualify any life 
is not on earth as pretty weird but you mean substantially different kh right and where coming back to 
operational approach to searching for life where we can start to slice and dice things in a very pragmatic 
when i look out at europa and enceladus titan also has a liquid water ocean beneath its icy shell 
that ocean may be mixing with rocks i can generate an hypothesis about the prospects for carbon and waterbased 
out there in our solar system sc right kh and that hypothesis is founded on observations of life here 
earth so life on earth is water and carbonbased water is the solvent carbon is the key building block 
we can look at all the extreme environments on earth antarctica the hydrothermal vents etcetera and saying water and 
life is tenacious sc always a little bit of life everywhere on earth anyway chuckle kh right sc whenever 
say that i feel like raising my hand and saying not equally hospitable to life all these different right 
mean less kh right sc in the desert in antarctica than there is in the rain forest kh one 
percent sc okay but a little bit of life little microbial life everywhere kh right and please be aware 
oftentimes when i talk about the search for life and life on earth as beautiful as the penguins were 
antarctica or the giraffes of the african savanna are etcetera multicellular life metazoans these larger creatures are boring as 
laughter kh and the reason for that is we all just represent the tiniest of twig on the vast 
tree of life sc yeah not a lot of diversity within the metazoans kh right for all of the 
diversity we all are heterotrophs where we eat carbon compounds and breathe oxygen to essentially do a fancy camp 
burn from penguins to sea slugs to giraffes all doing the same metabolic process sc whereas kh microbes holy 
laughter kh they have figured out a way to eat anything and everything from acids to bases and doing 
at high pressures low pressures you name it sc yeah which is extraordinarily reassuring for the search of life 
life elsewhere kh exactly and so when i talk about the diversity of life on earth and how we 
our study of life on earth to provide a bridge for assessing habitable environments beyond earth in that microbial 
sc okay not gonna find penguins on the ice shelf of europa kh well birds i mean come on 
kh i rule out octopi or things like that sc distract from titan going into the weird life kh 
we can make an hypothesis about water and carbonbased life on europa and enceladus and even within the water 
of titan and that water and carbon hypothesis is rooted in our understanding of how microbial life works on 
those oceans if you transported microbes on earth to those worlds the evidence that we have today would indicate 
those microbes could survive so we can design spacecraft to test that hypothesis of water and carbonbased life water 
the solvent carbon is the building block titan along with having this deep ocean beneath its icy crust also 
this crazy methane cycle the surface temperature and pressure of titan so the atmosphere is thick on titan primarily 
but the temperature and pressure of titan is such that methane exists in all three phases solid liquid sc 
point kh triple point exactly so solid liquid and gas similar to where earth resides in terms of its 
being at the triple point of water and so got these seasonal cycles going on and raining down methane 
ethane and potentially larger organics and on its surface the cassini spacecraft helped reveal all of these methanedominated lakes 
seas and this is where things get weird laughter sc a lake of methane kh a lake of methane 
already pretty weird yeah kh yeah and so could you have weird life on titan where the solvent the 
of life get mixed and combined on earth water where the solvent is liquid methane i know the answer 
that question nobody really does sc no kh chemically the difference between liquid methane and liquid water is that 
is a polar solvent and methane is nonpolar water molecules have a slight positive and negative charge on them 
to the way in which the electrons arrange themselves in the two hydrogens and oxygen methane does not have 
sc methane is like a perfect little tetrahedron kh yeah and so in chemistry like dissolves like so water 
very good at dissolving other polar compounds in part what allows the chemistry of our biology to work and 
course as you know from mixing oil and water oil is for the most part nonpolar and sc yeah 
out kh separates right sc and kind of useful kh kinda useful right now if you flip the tables 
have a nonpolar solvent like methane could you get enough interesting chemistry done to really drive biochemistry sc yeah 
there is water there sc it would be different kh it would be different and thankfully last year last 
if my memory serves a blur nasa selected a mission to get back out to titan this phenomenally exciting 
called dragonfly by my friend zibi turtle and out of the applied physics laboratory in maryland this is a 
which hopefully will launch in the mid sorry get out to titan in the mid sc okay i was 
say way out there hard to plan that far but okay kh too many missions so it gets out 
titan in the mid parachutes down through the atmosphere gets rid of its heat shield and all that and 
starts turning on these rotors so just like the quad drones that you see and somewhat sc yeah sending 
drone to titan chuckle kh right so sending a sc sending one to mars also i know kh right 
the mars helicopter has just got one set of rotors on it the titan dragonfly mission is much larger 
size of a dining room table and along with looking at the geology and geochemistry of titan looking at 
dunes and all of the interesting things that are happening in the world of titan also going to be 
for signs of life sc if it gets shot down by ornery locals be a great success right kh 
long as we get a picture of them before they shoot us down sc is there yeah a camera 
the drone i hope right kh yeah just a beautiful mission and fun about titan my friend and brilliant 
and engineer ralph lorenz has done this calculation now if you could survive on titan as a human a 
of caveats there sc yeah kh and have your own icarus wings you could fly sc you could fly 
low gravity thick atmosphere kh exactly sc glad that calculation was done yeah tax payer dollars at work kh 
laughter kh so but that in part helped lead to the viability of doing a rotor craft mission that 
land on titan in search for signs of life sc wow kh now primarily with that mission and a 
on that mission be looking for evidence of perhaps waterbased life that has been erupted from below but also 
our eye towards the discovery driven aspect of science sc yeah who knows right kh what yeah what if 
is life that has originated and evolved in these methaneethane rich lakes sc is the trick that we even 
how to look for that so we have to design an experiment actually looking for certain chemicals kh right 
here again we come back to that issue of specificity life being very selective we think that even if 
is based on some chemistry unlike life as we know it even if life is weird compared to the 
water and carbon based life that we know it will still have that selectivity and specificity where it is 
on fundamental chemical units sc like certain molecules more than others kh right and so if you do an 
with something like a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer you might see a pattern even in weird life that distinguishes 
from the abiotic processes that are just random and link together atoms by atoms sc i suppose we should 
in a word for enceladus the other place we should look kh enceladus is phenomenal sc yeah when i 
people talk there are there are certainly people who think that of all these enceladus is the one that 
the most likely to have life i know you might not be in that but there are enceladus partisans 
kh and these worlds are all beautiful and meritorious of exploration sc like your children yes you love them 
kh right enceladus just to enceladus is the new kid on the block the new shiny object and so 
cassini mission just ended and we have a lot of new data on enceladus and so a lot of 
about enceladus and enceladus was very generous laughter kh wonderfully so so enceladus coming back to europa and the 
of ocean that took that kind of detailed physics the galileo spacecraft did not observe any plumes erupting out 
ice shell we now think got some curious evidence using the hubble space telescope and some galileo data for 
rich plumes coming out of europa but when cassini flew by enceladus bang there it was these plumes erupting 
of the icy surface of enceladus now initially skeptics myself among them viewed those plumes as perhaps just a 
of the ice and clathrates perhaps and other things we see jets of material elsewhere in our solar system 
see comets producing jets so early on some of the evidence for enceladus could have been explained by these 
being analogous to cometary jets where just causing the out gassing but as the cassini spacecraft flew by and 
the plumes of water it also revealed that the plumes have methane and carbon dioxide a smattering of organics 
for me what really turned the tide was the discovery of salts sc okay the definition of a salt 
so a salt something with cations and anions traditionally you think of salts as like sodium chloride potassium chloride 
chloride magnesium sulphate all sorts of stuff where you can take a positively charged cation and combine it with 
negatively charged anion sc so that means the life would be tasty kh laughter kh no why are salts 
in terms of evidence for an ocean on enceladus if you just had water in the plumes of enceladus 
water mixed with carbon dioxide and methane and even small organics those are all things that we see in 
sc okay so no biggie in some sense kh no biggie in some sense now still very exciting sc 
cool but yeah kh right sc but we see them a trillion comets in the oort cloud chuckle kh 
and comets the way we get those compounds like methane and some of the organics is through the ice 
things like methane and potentially ammonia and then it gets photolytically processed uv light from the sun processes it 
produces these larger organic compounds so at enceladus you could be very conservative and say this evidence of an 
this is just photochemistry combined with some devolatilization of the ice but with salts we really see salts on 
sc right kh salts are a harbinger of water rock interaction liquid water leaching through silicates sc right kh 
for me when the cosmic dust analyzer on cassini returned evidence of salts that was sc so sign of 
not a sign of life but once you have the water then maybe life appropriate kh right and so 
me the cassini observation of the plumes and identifying that the plumes of enceladus have salts that gives me 
large degree of confidence that actually sampling plumes that are connected to a liquid water ocean below sc and 
we have evidence that an icy crust on the top kh of enceladus yeah yeah absolutely that goes back 
the first piece of the puzzle analogous to europa and i should of course mention that for both europa 
enceladus the geology of the icy surfaces point to very very young ice sc which is good kh right 
has to be resurfacing this material some sort of geological cycling of the ice with something below repaves the 
of europa and the ice of enceladus to give you a surface with no craters at least sc right 
not quiet kh not quiet right now at enceladus as the story would unfold from cassini additional evidence would 
the ocean hypothesis the moving of the ice shell a decoupled ice shell a shell that is freeflowing and 
from a rocky interior that was observed on enceladus sc oh okay i know that so that really clinches 
deal in some sense kh yeah the elaborations sc gotta be some liquid layer in between the ice and 
rock kh right and then there is also evidence of hydrogen and other things that actually point to potentially 
hydrothermalism active hydrothermal activity within enceladus even things like silicon nanograins have been discovered sc okay so the people 
are very excited about enceladus are not just whistling dixie a lot kh right and incredibly excited about enceladus 
rub on enceladus though if you do a oneforone comparison with europa sc keeping in mind talking to the 
of the europa lander chuckle kh well not a pi the europa dead so sc oh dead kh well 
technology development effort sc well okay kh planned to go to the launch pad yeah in order to get 
to be sc but a europa guy kh yes but an enceladus guy too published on enceladus not as 
as europa but just doing a again a full calibration europa is kilometers in diameter about the size of 
moon a moon that we understand very well i mean very well given the data available we think that 
has been around for the history of the solar system we think it formed around jupiter as jupiter was 
and we think that the ocean itself of europa has been there for the history of the solar system 
billions of years yeah kh yeah now coupled with that some interesting chemistry that occurs within ice shell and 
and hopefully get to that but enceladus when it comes to this issue of time i mentioned the keystones 
habitability liquid water elements and energy a fourth potentially fundamental keystone is time long has that convergence of keystones 
now that may not be important it may be that life arises very quickly but if i were a 
man i sc more time the more chances right yeah kh right and so enceladus there is a significant 
within the planetary science community right now about first and foremost makes enceladus tick the full tidal energy evaluation 
enceladus and how long has enceladus and its ocean been and part of the thread that people have pulled 
is the rings of saturn rings are not particularly stable sc right kh so the rings of saturn according 
some again this is a heavy debate a wonderful debate a beautiful debate this is why we love doing 
we do but a camp in the saturn community that says the rings of saturn tell us that something 
happened not too long ago because otherwise those rings should have either collapsed been pulled into saturn or been 
evolved out sc not too long ago might be millions of years kh tens of millions of years a 
chuckle sc not just a few decades ago chuckle kh right so the time scale is geologic and astronomic 
so some of the hypotheses are that maybe the rings of saturn were created one hundred million years ago 
a kuiper belt object a pluto sized object careening into saturn and hitting a large moon breaking it up 
the rings and a bunch of the small moons etcetera and so there is a camp that says that 
rings of saturn are young and potentially some of the smaller moons including enceladus could be quite young and 
enceladus and its ocean are young then i kind of view enceladus as this like fizzing alkaseltzer tablet perhaps 
incredibly interesting chemistry but i kind of am a little more interested in a stable world like europa that 
know has been around for a long time sc yeah has been and this is good the issue of 
because i would like to put everything in a bigger context here i think that our listeners probably are 
to say that microbes are awesome but what they would really like is little aliens flying around in spaceships 
not gonna find that in the solar system i think is most likely but maybe elsewhere in the universe 
what can we learn from looking at these other places in the solar system that might tell us something 
the likelihood of life multicellular life intelligent life technological life elsewhere in the world kh right so this is 
great question that actually folds into the second aspect of europa and enceladus and some of the chemistry that 
find very compelling about europa that is potentially lacking on enceladus and this comes back to gibbs free energy 
redox chemistry the coupling of reductants with oxidants and we touched on this earlier a reductant is a compound 
wants to give away an electron an oxidant is a compound that wants to accept an electron and the 
i like to think of my in physics and just biochemical batteries and you connect the positive and negative 
on sc let the electrons flow kh exactly so life alleviates chemical disequilibrium in the environment the same way 
when you buy a battery at a corner store that battery will store energy for a long time and 
trickle out but you can put that battery in a flashlight you can connect that battery to a circuit 
allow those electrons to flow and in so doing you get work done you get the work of shining 
on something or running a little remote control car or what have you and the battery runs out a 
faster because completed the circuit biology does that in our environment around earth there are all sorts of geochemical 
and the microbes tap into that sc who was the biologist who said that life is just an electron 
for a place to rest chuckle kh i know but whoever it was was brilliant sc a good quote 
that was true yeah kh my friend and colleague everett shock loves to say that the energy is being 
to eat a free lunch chuckle kh and so getting energy out of this chemistry available in the environment 
so why is this important and how does this tie back to your question of squid in europa another 
of what intrigues me about europa potentially being a better place to search for life is the chemistry of 
hydrothermal events active sea floors are great places for reductants and we see that on planet earth hydrogen methane 
pump out of our sea floor and microbes love the reductants but if all you have is the reductant 
all you have is the negative terminal on the battery the circuit is not complete sc yeah nowhere for 
electrons to go kh nowhere to go right so you need an oxidant you need a source of oxidants 
on earth a lot of the oxidants are things like oxygen and sulfate etcetera etcetera and got tons of 
on enceladus not clear to me that it has a source of oxidants so it could have an active 
floor pumping out the methane and hydrogen but if no good source of oxidants then it might be kind 
game over from a gibbs free energy standpoint from a what life can utilize standpoint europa has this beautiful 
also somewhat frustrating surface environment where by merit of being embedded in magnetic field icy surface is being bombarded 
charged particle or radiation kh electrons energetic electrons tens of kev to tens of mev electrons ions protons etcetera 
careening into surface ice and that radiation chemistry that radiolytic processing is splitting apart water in the simplest case 
apart in the things like h oh some of the h escapes some of the hydrogen escapes and oh 
combine with another oh to from what is hydrogen peroxide exactly the same stuff that you buy at a 
to disinfect a cut kh we know thanks to bob carlson and colleagues and the galileo spectrometer that hydrogen 
exists within the surface ice of europa further to that we also know that thanks to observations by john 
and wendy calvin using ground based telescopes oxygen exists within the ice of europa and we know that things 
sulfate and other very useful oxidants exist within the ice of europa in large part from that radiation process 
if the ice of europa is getting mixed into the ocean below you now have this beautiful scenario where 
radiation and the radiolytic processing in the surface ice creates that positive terminal of the biochemical battery so if 
oxygen peroxide sulphates etcetera get mixed into the ocean they could be combined with reductants from the sea floor 
help power life sc yep okay kh and so people often say the radiation of surface problematic it can 
destroy evidence for life is it gonna make landing there yes and yes chuckle kh but the upshot of 
radiation is that it could also be central to that third keystone of life the energy component of life 
sulphate microbes love sulphate but as i mentioned oxygen is also present in ice oxygen is critical to the 
of large multicellular life on earth sc okay wait that was a big leap you just made there chuckle 
yep good good laughter sc i mean we first need to make nuclear cells kh right sc on actual 
life happened pretty quickly multicellular life took forever kh well i know if it happened quickly so we know 
life debate about this but some say that the first evidence for life is at the billion years ago 
in time which would put it about seven hundred million years after the origin of the planet itself eight 
million years somewhere in that range more convincing evidence is available at to billion years ago then multicellular life 
utilizes oxygen that emerge until about seven hundred million years ago six hundred fifty million years ago six hundred 
years ago sc yeah took three billion years kh right chuckle and sc of little microbes bumping into each 
i wanna get together with kh right and so this long period of those early metabolisms and then the 
of photosynthesis and people love to talk about life as darwinian selection and survival of the fittest etcetera predator 
prey and all that all well and good but i also like to say that life is also largely 
acquisitions and mergers laughter sc that was good okay kh the symbiosis that took place right sc okay yeah 
and some what similar to economics sc could you say about romance and love chuckle kh go on laughter 
swiping left and swiping right you know kh love powers everything chuckle sc but sure we can be capitalists 
it good kh right so acquisitions and mergers what do i mean by that well in the early days 
gene transfer there was all sorts of back and forth of open source life was open source give me 
code give you my unix red hat etcetera chuckle so horizontal gene transfer dominated in the early days then 
things really started to sc so by which we mean for those who know not just that a little 
and you split and you duplicate your genes and the only thing that happens with the occasional mutation but 
literally you take in dna from your neighbor or give dna to your neighbor kh right exactly sc which 
crazy talk but okay kh so looking at the biological github and sc yeah forking and splitting and whatever 
is you do yeah kh but then as things got a little more complicated you start to be more 
and less porous and then instead of just grabbing genes those early microbes started to subsume other microbes bacteria 
up other archaea back then who knows what they actually qualified as but singlecelled organisms engulfed other organisms they 
their capability just like a google would acquire what the heck is google acquiring everything right laughter sc yeah 
know some selfdriving car yeah chuckle kh so this acquisitions and mergers strategy is very true in the history 
life on earth sc but when did that happen when did kh so a lot of debate about the 
scales for when do mitochondria and organelle which once upon a time was an independent microbe when did that 
incorporated when do the cyanobacteria that really did the business of photosynthesis when did they get incorporated into other 
and even the nucleus a lot of debate about that and within the biology community once upon a time 
were prokaryotes and eukaryotes no nucleus and got a nucleus but what the tree of life is telling us 
what the study of life on earth is telling us is that a lot more to it sc not 
simple i know yeah it never is that simple why you should do physics instead of biology kh f 
ma chuckle sc exactly all you need kh but so fast forward to the emergence of multicellular life i 
get to the squids on europa sc no i know chuckle kh thankfully life on earth began to utilize 
energy from the sun our apparent star and was able to start converting the to oxygen and the initial 
of that pumping of oxygen into our atmosphere caused the ocean to rust out essentially oxidizing a lot of 
iron in our ocean forming what we now see as banded iron formations which are where we go to 
iron and then once the ocean rusted out we started building up oxygen in our atmosphere and once oxygen 
got to a sufficient level a few microbes started to realize that if they teamed up they could collaboratively 
the oxygen and some of the organics in solution to do the metabolism that we now know and love 
depend upon which is that heterotrophy of eating organics and burning them with oxygen sc so saying the transition 
multicellularity was not just a bunch of random bumping into each other but it was opportunistic kh totally opportunistic 
about it like if we go back to the battery analogy a lot of microbes have figured out ways 
survive on the tiniest of watch battery methanogens and sulphate reducers operate with tens of kilojoules per mole of 
negative change in gibbs free energy compare that to the hundreds of kilojoules to thousands of kilojoules that are 
by larger organisms such as us and so yeah it was an energetically opportunistic innovation to utilize the oxygen 
the air as the oxidant and organics in the environment as the reductant sc so kh so on europa 
in my dream of dreams sc yeah late in the podcast we can dream a little bit let our 
down here kh so as i mentioned the radiation processing produces oxygen in the ice and the ice of 
is geologically young the surface of europa globally is tens of millions of years old a flash of a 
geologically speaking comparable to the age of our oceanic crust here on earth and those are some of the 
rocks on earth so on europa if the ice is cycling into the ocean directly and a significant if 
know much about the conveyor belt type of motion of the ice and what may or may not be 
subduction subsumption all sorts of things like that but if the ice is delivering oxygen to ocean on a 
short geological time scale you could have enough oxygen in ocean to support organisms on earth you could get 
concentrations that are found in some of the minimum zones in ocean and there you find polychaete worms and 
sc so the motivation from multicellular life might be there on europa kh it could be there even without 
sunshine sc yeah so we should tell the audience you were a consultant on the movie europa report kh 
sc and not gonna give away anything except that yeah they go to europa and they find life kh 
sc boy do they find life yeah kh yeah and if you seen the europa report the writing team 
production team the actors etcetera that was a great project to be a part of and you and i 
worked on various movie consults together and had a lot of fun sc that one was closer to the 
science than most of the ones done kh well so you know i think you and i worked on 
together sc thor yeah kh with kenneth branagh and we can come to that but for the most part 
know what your opinion is but we can add suggestions and try and guide the vector of where it 
go but at the end of the day no big rub on us if they actually take our advice 
the europa report my colleague steve vance and i were like well this is really close to and chuckle 
care a little bit more about going on here than we do on kh so if gonna do this 
you at least commit to us that gonna try and get things and they did they were absolutely brilliant 
yeah i love the movie it was a lowbudget movie that really did a very good job kh made 
something like eight dollars million dollars the zero g stuff that they did in most large budget films sc 
good movie magic kh use a vomit comet to get zero g the brilliance of that team they used 
yoga balls and had the actors on their backs and on their stomachs rolling on green yoga balls in 
little capsule to give the appearance of floating in space i love that clever way of going about things 
i hope that there are the squid in europa i think that would be very cool but sort of 
things up with the lessons for beyond the solar system that we might get from the solar system one 
thing is if we say that we really do a good job at looking at europa enceladus titan and 
either find life on all of them or on none of them how willing will you be to then 
that to lessons for the rest of the universe kh right this is a great and very important question 
we do a robust exploration of the alien oceans beyond earth europa enceladus titan pluto triton you name it 
will either find evidence of life or not i think both answers are equally profound so if we find 
then kind of off to the races the origin of life is easy life should arise wherever the conditions 
right europa type worlds are potentially ubiquitous in our universe and we could live in a biological universe conversely 
we find evidence of life on these worlds that gives us important information on hypotheses for the origin of 
that would tell me that the origin of life most likely does not occur around hydrothermal vents and it 
not occur in icy and we talk much about origins and ice but a whole another thread sc or 
just almost never occurs at all kh or it almost never occurs but in the case of not finding 
in these alien oceans beyond earth i would say then that the origin of life does require continents and 
warm tide pools and the types sc yeah that would be evidence for that yeah kh right so europa 
no continents no rivers and tide pools so we can add to the information content even with a null 
and granted a null result would be hard to come by have to explore pretty thoroughly sc but willing 
spend that money kh well and the other thing is that ocean ocean these are global oceans and so 
you sample in a few places the ocean flows around and you can at least have some confidence in 
connectivity so then extrapolating to our galaxy and the universe more broadly if we find life in our own 
if we find it on mars or within these alien oceans then i think we start to enter a 
where life on earth is a biological singularity it operates in the truest form of singularity where our evidence 
life on earth would say that it is a layer on top of biology and that gibbs free energy 
these things the laws of physics sc on top of on top of geology sorry you said on top 
geology kh physics is the base chemistry and geology are the layer there and then biology is sort of 
fancy layer sc so saying that we have enough other opportunities to find life in the solar system that 
we it really does suggest that maybe not that ubiquitous kh right and that continents and earthlike worlds are 
for the origin of life now mars serves as a good template for that if we do find evidence 
life on mars it could be a standard bearer for life existing on another world but coming back to 
we talked about earlier i would be reluctant to endow it with a second origin just because sc yeah 
tricky especially if it were very similar kh exactly and so yeah then we get to this issue of 
singularity the laws of physics as we know it the laws of chemistry geology etcetera lead to chemical disequilibrium 
free energy being a motivator for the metabolisms of life and life being kind of a tool that the 
uses to increase entropy and to accelerate us to that entropic death but if it arises only on earth 
something else is sparking the fire sc so what is final question what is your favorite solution to the 
paradox of why we have not seen life elsewhere we could imagine that life is rare that multicellular life 
rare that technological life is rare or that technological life is everywhere and just not talking to us do 
have a favorite one of these kh right so answer this in two parts first and foremost and i 
at the seti institute many years ago and one of my favorite experiences as a young scientist was approaching 
drake after a seminar and i was a young intern up at nasa ames at the time laughter sc 
the drake equation fame yes kh i said long been thinking about all this stuff and a honor to 
and all that stuff and i said what do you think would be the next intelligent species on planet 
if you fast forward the time scales for happening on planet without missing a beat he said and laughter 
really okay kh i thought he was gonna say dolphins and whales and all these things sc chimps or 
kh right but squirrels and raccoons in part because they are living and surviving and developing in such close 
to the intelligence that currently exists sc so being selected for cleverness kh right right and why i love 
answer but with respect to the fermi paradox my primary answer is we just have not done enough searching 
think a poorly framed paradox sc well fermi as i understand it the original version of the paradox was 
you could build selfreplicating probes they could fill the galaxy pretty quickly and we would notice that kh right 
turing machines etcetera you could populate the galaxy quickly would we see that that is kind people kind of 
that under the rug so i happen to think that the center of the milky way galaxy is like 
eight and a half kilo parsecs out from the galactic bulge in the boon docks like in northern canada 
to connect to the internet and saying we dial fermi paradox is like the internet well it does just 
in the right place you connected long and so i do think sc so there but we found it 
your favorite kh well i think we searched in enough ways and in enough clever ways and by clever 
mean gotta cover more of the radio spectrum but we also need to think about optical seti we need 
think about ways in which advanced civilizations would communicate with each other so answer a is we searched enough 
b comes to that we really see and one of my favorite answers to this is the dark forest 
you read the threebody problem that trilogy of books that goes into contact with alien civilizations etcetera i highly 
that trilogy and i wanna talk about it but i wanna spoil it for people sc spoil it spoil 
kh yeah spoil it sc it is worth reading i agree kh but basically the point sc cixin liu 
correct you probably have the pronunciation much better than sc well close anyway sorry kh the basic point is 
always advantageous to broadcast your existence and so we kind of take it for granted that of course if 
there going sc wanna talk to us chuckle kh right so my part a and part b answer to 
fermi paradox sc good well get some data once you get your spacecraft up there and maybe around have 
back on the podcast to talk about results from your lander kh potentially sooner than that for the love 
god known each other for a long time but listen like think about it the year you just mentioned 
thousand forty even how exciting is that sc oh very exciting this could be the century kh within the 
few decades exactly whether dragonfly going to titan clipper going to europa hopefully a lander going to europa hopefully 
mission fly through the plumes of enceladus exoplanets going gangbusters seti hopefully taking on a broader and broader search 
surveying those exoplanets within the next few decades we could potentially answer this primordial age old question of we 
gonna revolutionise biology gonna revolutionize how we think about our place in the universe and so for all of 
pains and agony of trying to operate on these time scales we do live in a beautiful time where 
might transform the universe in which we live into a biological universe sc think of a better ending place 
that kevin hand thanks so much for being on the podcast kh thanks sean a lot of fun to 
you and chat with you music one of your best maybe the best could have listened for hours hand 
articulate clear and engaging your interaction also articulate and clear enriched the discussion considerably great stuff thanks hi sean 
absolutely love and more recently biggest even though its been a little bit guttiing to have to accept that 
have forgotten so much more than i remember from my o level maths and physics of forty years ago 
i digress which sort of brings me round to the point i really enjoyed mindscape the extra length of 
episode in these particular times was a bonus and even though i had started to think that kevin could 
albert a run for his money in the eccentric scientist stakes his subject what it represents and encompasses along 
his truly passionate desire to cover everything made this episode compelling although i felt like i had worked only 
little less harder than you when i got to the end of the podcast but that is no criticism 
am not exactly overworked right now please keep them coming stay safe simon sw london fascinating conversation enjoyed the 
show i just wanted to share a video that explains that dark forest solution to the fermi paradox has 
lot of problems with it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzmctmgavkrq i loved answer of raccoons and squirrels thought about that too though not 
as much as drake and hand and come to the same conclusion the closeness to human civilization is a 
but it has also got to be that they have hands more or less capable of grasping objects like 
do a dolphin ever going to make and use tools i agree with all of the above comments this 
was so fascinating and i could have listened for hours more i would love for you to invite him 
and go into more detail about the theories around the chemical origins of life on earth great content comments
