the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll we have yet another experimental kind of podcast today our guest is 
jeffrey who is literally an experimentalist an experimental neuroscientist at university college london where she studies the cognitive map 
the brain how we find where we are in the universe and how that triggers certain neurons in our 
but not gonna be talking about neuroscience for the most part kate and i were both participants in a 
in costa rica a covley workshop on space time and the brain on this general idea of relating space 
time to how represented in brains i gave a talk while i was there on complexity and its relationship 
entropy and kate hearing the talk responded to it in her own talk talking about the evolution of complexity 
a biological and environmental context sc where things are much more subtle and nuanced and a lot of details 
as a physicist i could gloss over so together we thought that it would be fun rather than just 
interviewing her about her stuff to talk about this area of the relationship between entropy and complexity how complex 
come to be over time whether cosmologically here on earth or even within a social domain and then how 
goes away there can be catastrophes right there are extinction events the ultimate equilibration of the universe so this 
more than any other podcast ever had i think i am doing just as much of the talking as 
official guest possible that doing more of the talking than kate did but anyway both sort of trying to 
things this is neither one of us laying down the law from on high a true interdisciplinary exploration and 
think gonna find a lot of fun so go music sc kate jeffrey welcome to the mindscape podcast kate 
thank you sc so this is an unusual but fun episode i think in the sense that gonna try 
make it a twoway conversation right some podcasters just make every one of their conversations a twoway conversation i 
try to let the guest do most of the talking but gonna be a little bit more balanced here 
maybe explain why the case why you give us some of your background what you do for a living 
your respectable part of your day job kj so not a physicist at all so i have to start 
an immediate disclaimer here a neuroscientist and interested in how the brain makes an internal representation of the world 
how it creates knowledge structures and i do that by implanting electrodes into the brains of rats and mice 
listening to the signals and then trying to correlate what we can pick up with what the animal with 
sensory inputs its behavior and really trying to understand how it comprehends space and forms memories of its experiences 
all that kind of thing so that sort of led me to thinking about space and time and what 
actually means and i came up with some bigger questions and how i kind of started straying into your 
to some extent sc right well we were at a conference together a covley workshop in costa rica on 
time and the brain so those are three big topics obviously and i gave a talk where i gave 
of my usual spiel about entropy and complexity and i can rehearse that here but then you gave a 
that sort of built on that in some way were you already thinking along these lines you been you 
pretty prepared kj yeah so i had come along to that meeting prepared to talk about how the brain 
a map of threedimensional space but my talk was on the last day and by the time we had 
to that point and the physicists and the neuroscientists had exchanged a few conversations i felt that i had 
to contribute that was gonna be useful about my research and more to contribute about some other things that 
thinking a lot about so i had never actually formalized those things before so i had to kind of 
down and construct from scratch sort of an assemblage of my ideas but what i had been thinking about 
the last few months is how the nervous system has really come to be in the course of the 
of the universe and the evolution of life and how managed to navigate the various bumps in the road 
the way kj so there have been a number of major extinctions for example in the evolution of life 
of course facing another one at the moment which has been occupying my thoughts a lot so just been 
about the fact that life seems to be inherently unstable and yet seen more and more of it accumulate 
the universe has gone on and i just got curious about the dynamics of that why does that happen 
it was fantastic to be able to talk to you physics guys who all have a thermodynamic kind of 
and when you talked about complexity and entropy and all of that i just had so many questions so 
thought gonna lay out some of my questions and then we can sc yeah and here we are doing 
this is sort of the culmination of that sc cool so how should we do this you want me 
start with like i said my conventional spiel about entropy and complexity and then we can build on that 
think that your take on it is in many ways a lot more nuanced just doing the simplest physics 
where we try to get everything is a spherical and everything is very simple and as someone who cares 
life and biosphere and things like that you are very correctly saying a bit more complicated than that when 
get to the real world kj yeah so yeah i think you should start definitely sc okay so this 
something where i became interested in it because i became interested in entropy entropy for those out there who 
have escaped me talking about this is a way of talking about how disorderly or how disorganized things are 
more particularly if you have a set of tiny little constituents atoms or molecules or cells or whatever and 
are different ways to arrange them microscopically and you can see certain features of those macroscopic arrangements so you 
at my favorite example is a cup of coffee with cream being mixed into it you see where the 
is you see where the coffee is but you see where the individual molecules are so ludwig boltzmann in 
said is basically a way of counting how many ways there are to arrange the microscopic constituents to give 
that macroscopic sc so in other words we coursegrain the description in terms of what we can see about 
macroscopically and then we just count the number of microscopic states that would contribute to that way being and 
rule the second law thermodynamics it says that typically the entropy increases because very naturally if you start in 
configuration where only a small number of arrangements that look that way just by natural evolution without any direction 
will move toward a situation where in a higher entropy state there are more ways to be high entropy 
to be low entropy a very quick second law of thermodynamics intro but that makes sense right kj yeah 
do you use the second law of thermodynamics a lot as a working psychologist biologist kj not me personally 
theoretical neuroscientists think about it in terms of free energy and high inflation theory and that type of thing 
just tend to encounter it when i messed things up in an experiment it all comes out wrong sc 
is part of our daily lives certainly true kj so just to ask you a bit more about this 
because i understand how it works for a box of gas molecules say but i start to run into 
of understanding when i think about for example the entropy in a molecule of dna so it seems to 
that the number of microscopic states that correspond to that macroscopic state more more than one set of numbers 
you like so one of them is the number of microscopic states that would just lead you to a 
molecule and one of them is the number of microscopic states that would lead you to the genome for 
say kj so microscopically they look exactly the same a spiral molecule but the functioning of that molecule in 
bigger picture is completely different so i struggle with saying that the entropy of those two molecules is the 
but my understanding is that a physicist would say it sc well i think that a careful physicist would 
it depends in the sense that if you put your finger on one of the long standing controversial aspects 
the boltzmannian statistical mechanical way of talking about entropy which is that it seems to involve some human choices 
the definition of things i tried to make it sound pretty objective by saying the macroscopic features that you 
observe are how you coursegrain microscopic states into macroscopic ones but someone could say who is doing the observing 
a better observer see a different entropy than a worse to a large extent in practice not a big 
because the laws of physics make certain features microscopically observable to us and not others sc so when we 
the cream in the coffee for example even if you built a robot or even if you met an 
or whatever none of them is gonna be able to see the individual molecules and their positions and momenta 
gonna see the same things that a human being sees so there is something robust about nature that suggests 
ways of course graining into macro states but when you get to the edge cases where not a lot 
moving parts used to having number of molecules and used to having a much smaller number than that so 
a dna molecule versus some other sort of polymer of some sort yeah what exactly you count as the 
constituents and how you course grain them into macrostates can matter can be different and it might depend on 
i think which is what getting at sc two molecules that might look the same physically from just sort 
if your course graining is just how long is it how stretchy is it how bendy is it two 
might look the same but if asking what is its function in the cell those same two molecules might 
very different i think that my answer is use whatever one you want just be consistent once you start 
it so i think that the right physics answer is to say no you have to ignore the detailed 
between dna and some other long molecule i think that it just depends on what context working in and 
think also okay i think a flaw i just think something to recognize kj but are you saying that 
is a subjective thing then that contextdependent sc it is subjective in a sense but in the following sense 
same thing is true i would say about any emergent phenomenon whenever we have a microscopic description which is 
accurate perhaps perfectly precise and a macroscopic description in different terms which is only a good approximation always the 
where we have to use that macroscopic approximation if we were demon if we knew the location of every 
freeman coffee in the cup and could do the calculations in our head we need to course grain at 
but nevertheless there is something real and useful about the course graining certain ways of course graining that would 
no sense we course grain the coffee by saying in every little region of space count the number of 
molecules and cream molecules or whatever we say average the number of molecules over here then a number of 
at a completely different place for some arbitrary crazy reason sc and the reason why is because course graining 
that way would give a description that has no simple dynamics not robust the nice thing about emergence is 
throw away an enormous amount of information the locations and velocities of every individual molecule but what you keep 
still somehow representing a true pattern in the dynamics kj yeah i kind of get that but i still 
a fundamental issue so if you take a stretch of dna that is meaningful so genes for some organism 
as time goes by and mutations occur and the dna degrades the molecule will have the same macroscopic properties 
it will be degraded within the bigger picture so in some senses the information content which i kind of 
is somehow associated with entropy the information content has gone down even though the macroscopic qualities at that moment 
but where the macroscopic properties have changed is when you look at what happens to that molecule in time 
after the mutation gonna build a very degraded funnylooking organism instead of a normal looking one kj so struggling 
with this notion of what is meant by macroscopic properties are they just slices in the here now or 
you consider the entire history of that system over time as well as within the space sc well certainly 
usual way of doing it the history over time matter if it does matter then your physical description is 
more complicated not that impossible but we very much like in physics to think in markovian terms markovian just 
the simple sense that what happens at one moment depends on what happened in the immediate previous moment but 
the entire history of the past and likewise the future is predictable from right now not from information in 
past but what kind of prediction making is certainly relevant when you decide what is the information that you 
that you take into account when you make your macro states sc so if you care about the function 
that molecule within the cell then i certainly think that there are features of the cell that would go 
your features of the molecule that would go into your course graining like a slightly degraded dna molecule that 
its biological function it would be completely legit to count as a different macro state than one that looked 
much physically the same but did its function perfectly well kj but then you have taken time into account 
function is a thing that happens in time sc well i would say that what taking into account is 
statements like would the molecule act differently even right now if different things were happening to it i think 
to take into account but i need to actually see into the future to see what will happen to 
actual example of the molecule kj but you be able to distinguish a degraded dna from a wellformed dna 
in that sense until you had seen what happened to it in the future or knew the gene sequence 
like that sc yeah you be able to tell just by looking at it i guess is what saying 
by using the immediately macroscopic available information to you you would not be able to distinguish between them kj 
and indeed it has no meaning until you consider its future sc yeah i think this is a subtle 
case where you a whole discussion there are people who know a lot more about this than i do 
a whole discussion about hidden states within some macro states so ordinarily in statistical mechanics your hope is that 
of the microstates within a macro state not only look the same but for the most part they will 
the same now you know that not exactly true within some macro state of a glass of water there 
some individual microstates where suddenly the water will heat up except an ice cube will form in the water 
extremely unlikely and a very very tiny number of microstates but they exist and you would never know just 
looking at the glass of water but we get around that by saying well just so few of those 
can ignore them sc and again when you get down to a small number of moving parts you might 
be able to ignore that so i think that a lot of it just comes down to the fact 
you might not be able to reliably use some of these statistical mechanical ideas in regimes where cellular biology 
nanoscale physics really matter kj that seems like a big statement because the second law of thermodynamics is that 
supposed to govern the unfolding of the universe including living things sc well yes but the universe has a 
of moving parts in it and look if you have three moving parts no such thing as the second 
of thermodynamics right just a waste if you have then a reasonable approximation to it and if you have 
to the then really really really good so we gotta accept that fluctuations and unlikely events are hugely important 
the level of cellular biology completely irrelevant at the level of what goes on in your internal combustion engine 
yeah so i guess the thing been bothering me about entropy has been this apparent subjectivity sc yeah kj 
other thing struggled with is the way in which it requires space to be meaningful because all of the 
of entropy at the sort of thermodynamic level involve space and involve things being in one part of space 
the other is that a fair statement sc well a fair statement in physics generally that space is really 
in the sense that space and thinking talking slowly because as a physicist trying to answer questions about why 
their space in the first place which not worried about heavily and not worried about for this conversation but 
speaking space is the arena in which interactions between physical systems look local right sc two objects will interact 
each other when they are at the same or almost the same location in space in a way that 
interact with each other if they have the same velocity but are in very different locations in space right 
space is very very special for exactly that reason and i think that that should be true even for 
but you sound like maybe worried about it kj well i am a little i know if worried is 
right word but in thinking about entropy at the thermodynamic level it seems to be to do with probability 
example a particle being in a particular part of the space that has gotten woven in with my thinking 
evolution and why evolution has proceeded the way it has and then why life is slowly increased in complexity 
way it has and it seems to be that space is a very fundamental part of that process and 
as life evolves is the life forms are discovering new ways of extending the operation of their activities in 
spaces or ever bigger times and that opens up new possibilities for entropy to flow sc yeah no i 
exactly right so maybe i can sort of build on the little spiel i gave about the second law 
talk about complexity a little bit again thinking about it at the most very basic physicist level but we 
get a little bit more nuanced during our conversation here so if you believe that the history of our 
the last fourteen billion years has been a history of increasing entropy of increasing disorderliness and randomness then perfectly 
to wonder how complicated organized structures like you and me or the biosphere or whatever came into existence sc 
sort of bad creationist argument that says it have happened because the biosphere is very organized and the second 
says things just become more disorganized obviously wrong because the second law only says that entropy increases in closed 
and the earth and its biosphere are nowhere near a closed system getting wonderfully low entropy energy from the 
we are increasing the entropy of that energy and sending it back to the universe with much higher entropy 
the net effect of the earth on the entropy of the universe is certainly to increase it in complete 
with the second law of thermodynamics sc but that just says okay allowed that complex structures such as life 
on earth it explain why it should happen so with scott aronson and some other folks some students and 
lauren willette and brent werness we study this question and we propose the following thing which apparently is not 
new but well a little bit new but related to older ideas as entropy increases in a closed system 
you think about it carefully when entropy is really really low things are organized things even though what it 
for entropy to be low but not only are they organized simple not that many ways to be really 
low entropy sc so if all the cream is on the top of the cup and all the coffee 
on the bottom low entropy and simple whereas when things are high entropy when all the cream and coffee 
mixed into each other things are simple again right everything is mixed together very very simple in between that 
structures are allowed to exist and then you can ask the question it actually the case that in the 
of physical evolution complex structures do come to so do the cream and coffee simply smoothly blend into each 
and everything is simple all along the way or is it more like stirring with a spoon and you 
some complicated fractal patterns in it sc and so we did some simple simulations and we showed that you 
get either one you can get either kind of behavior and in cases where you wanted to get complex 
forming that was allowed as long as there were correlations in how the cream and coffee mixed into each 
so our hypothesis is number one that as entropy goes up complexity starts low grows and then fades away 
sc and number two there are situations in which that will happen and situations in which it and at 
one of the ingredients you need for it to happen are correlations in the evolutions it just be that 
thing interacts with a thing right next to it there has to be some rigidity or some longrange forces 
are pushing things together in concert so that structure forms on all sorts of different scales so the lesson 
we take from that which is not nearly justified by the work we did but i think the extrapolation 
it is that the formation of complex structures like the biosphere and individual organisms here on earth is not 
despite the fact that increasing because of entropy increasing if it for entropy increasing be in equilibrium where you 
high entropy already and there would be no living structures so we our existence as organized low entropy creatures 
actually part of the general tendency of things in the universe to increase in entropy overall kj but what 
driving the temporal unfolding of the increase in complexity followed by the decrease in complexity like what is the 
shaping that evolution of complexity sc right well so i think again two things a simple thing that allowed 
really not allowed to be complex when entropy is super super low and not allowed to be complex when 
is super super high the only place that complexity could exist is in between and then the only question 
does it as a matter of fact come into existence and the complicated one so we gave this really 
simple very kind of village idiot kind of answer which is that you need some longrange correlations or longrange 
so i think the correct thing to do like the next step is for me to hand over to 
laughter and say in the real world how did it happen and what lessons does that give us for 
larger physics questions of how might it happen in principle kj yeah so when i listened to you talk 
this in costa rica i had an aha moment when you talked about these correlations in space across space 
time because that suddenly seemed to me to explain why life becomes more complex because what happens as life 
evolved is that with each step and evolution something has happened that has suddenly enabled organisms to become much 
correlated over bigger areas and we have known for a long time that evolution has taken place in these 
of step transitions so for example for a billion years or so there were just cyanobacteria and everything was 
boring sc yep kj and then suddenly things happened for example suddenly five hundred million years ago multicellular life 
suddenly organisms were able to do a lot more than they could because once clusters of cells were able 
interact and were able to correlate their activity they were able to do tricks for example they could divide 
tasks between them one end could be for gathering food and one end could be for excreting food all 
that kind of stuff and there are a number of such transitions the evolution of the nervous system is 
one suddenly an organism could convey a message from one side of the cluster of cells to the other 
and so they could coordinate their activities they could do things like contract muscles and move and then when 
became able to move they could move out of one patch of food into a new patch of food 
just open up all sorts of amazing things and there have been a number of these and with each 
suddenly organisms have managed to extend their reach and become much more complex and humans i think are a 
example of that and now extending our reach out across space and out across time and into higher dimensions 
amazing stuff that doing sc yeah and i think so i think that one of the issues here one 
the features here is that complexity can build upon itself this is certainly the lesson both of the origin 
life and of the origin of multicellularity that only so many things that can happen if no life around 
if all the life is unicellular and the space of possibilities becomes enormously bigger as this phase transition happens 
physicists think about these transitions as phase transitions where the sort of one type of thing happening and then 
a little bit of something new comes on the scene and can take over because so much more advantageous 
again the biology needs to be a little bit richer and more nuanced here than the physics does so 
fine there can be a phase transition and you can explore different parts of the possibility space but how 
does that happen and yeah physicists are allowed to think of things happening in arbitrary numbers of dimensions or 
amounts of time but you wanna think of things happening in the real world and it matters chemistry matters 
well as biology what molecules can you build and how can they interact with each other sc and certainly 
uncontroversial to say that the origin of multicellularity opened up a huge space and in fact five hundred million 
later not anywhere near done exploring it things are still changing very rapidly the invention of technology has opened 
a whole new set of dimensions of space of possibility space if not space space but do you have 
feeling for sort of what general lessons we can learn from these transitions or the existence of them kj 
one of the things quite notable if you look over the evolution of complex life is that there have 
periods of time where been a sudden decrease in complexity as well so there have been several major extinctions 
suddenly things have gone backwards in very large steps and indeed life has nearly being obliterated several times so 
example when organisms discovered how to photosynthesize and suddenly reach out in space to grab the energy of the 
if you like they produced as a byproduct of that activity oxygen and the oxygen levels in the atmosphere 
very high and of course oxygen is very toxic and there was what they called the great oxygenation catastrophe 
big sudden fall in biodiversity and there have been other things kj so for example when organisms discovered how 
move they discovered how to burrow through the substrate that they were living in in the bottom of the 
and that allowed mixing of the water in the ocean with the substrate underneath and completely changed the chemistry 
again there was a big extinction and a lot of life forms disappeared they all and of course the 
that were left then gave rise to what came after and in fact there was a huge explosion of 
after that we had these several extinctions and life has managed to recover but there is this feeling when 
look at it that it might not have done that it might have been the case that the extinction 
been total and i see anything in thermodynamics that rules out that possibility kj and of course the situation 
in right now where we have extended our complex reach over space and time further than any life forms 
have before that also opens up more possibilities for extinction than life has ever had before i think a 
sc yeah no this is and i think that there is no thermodynamic guarantee that we extinguish all of 
but for the nonbiologist out there including myself dig into this statement that it was almost extinguished is that 
terms of a number of species or the number of organisms i would think that still gonna be some 
organisms that would tough it out even in these big events but maybe wrong kj well the ones that 
happened up to now have indeed left a lot of life still going both in terms of number of 
and in terms of numbers of genomes if you like individuals but not necessarily the case for example if 
managed to turn the earth into venus or cover it in radio activity then perhaps we can obliterate all 
so we know that life which when you look at it life seems to be very dynamic and inherently 
and rapidly changes into wonderful complexity but it does feel like it could also rapidly run into a wall 
something been thinking about a lot is are we about to do that and if we are can we 
it sc so i think that thermodynamics gives us no solace here i do think that this is an 
difference between the very simple example that we looked at with cream and coffee where the complexity just smoothly 
up and then smoothly went down roughly speaking because it was kind of it was kind of featureless only 
things there was cream molecules as it were in our simulation and coffee molecules there was not a lot 
room for different kinds of things but i think what getting at is that in the specific case of 
sort of mechanisms for this complexity that are very specific that certain biological channels for order to be created 
complexity to be created sc and in some sense fragile sort of unique ways or almost unique ways for 
to come into existence and build upon itself and not characterizing that feature as perfectly as i could but 
you know what i mean and maybe you can do it better but then this opens up the possibility 
catastrophe good that it builds this complexity so effectively but bad because it also opens the possibility for being 
out kj yes yeah i think very much a double edged sword but given that it strikes me as 
that nevertheless complexity has increased steadily over the evolution of the universe and so although in theory it can 
as thought as increased nevertheless it has generally gone up but something that you said in your talk which 
me kind of pause and contemplate the future gloomly is that complexity inevitably as the universe unfolds over the 
umpteenth billion years is going to go down again and if i understand you correctly the reason is to 
with entropy but not fully sure i have a handle on why so can you unpack that a bit 
sc sure i think that this is not the kind of thing that makes us change our life insurance 
or even change our ecological policies worldwide but it is true that this idea that complexity grows is one 
last forever at least true in the universe as we know it our universe is very young in some 
okay fourteen billion years old which sounds old and usually when you watch a tv show like cosmos which 
you the history of the universe that treats the big bang as the beginning and today as the end 
december of course not true the universe is gonna keep going and you can ask how does the last 
billion years compare to what comes next we discovered in one thousand nine hundred ninetyeight that the universe is 
only expanding but expanding faster and faster so no reason to think it will ever stop expanding it will 
just keep expanding forever but sc a part of the universe we can see is only finite in size 
universe is accelerating a horizon around us past which you will never be able to see so a finite 
of stuff in the universe and an infinite amount of time for it to evolve so like the cream 
the coffee it will reach equilibrium it will reach a point where everything is smoothed out into its highest 
configuration now this takes a very long time the oldest stars will or the longestlived stars i should say 
burn for trillions of years only been around for fourteen billion years and stars will still be shining a 
years from now but eventually they will use up all their nuclear fuel a feature of using up entropy 
up all the hydrogen helium that we had to burn in the stars and so the universal become dark 
it still be done yet there will still be a difference between black holes and planets and stars but 
even that difference will be smoothed out because all the stars and planets will fall into black holes chuckle 
have the universe with nothing but black holes in it and eventually even that will go away because hawking 
in the that black holes evaporate sc so the black holes will evaporate into nothingness over a time scale 
about ten to the years one googol years in oldfashioned terminology and then be nothing but empty space literally 
so no room for complexity in the heat death of the universe ten to the years from now maybe 
some tiny ephemeral life forms that form in the evaporating black hole atmospheres i know that seems very unlikely 
me and very unsatisfying certainly very different than what we have right now but yeah in some very real 
we are in the part of the history of the universe in the few billion years of history of 
universe where stars are forming and shining and acting is really robust entropy low entropy energy sources that allow 
to exist but that is in some sense a very temporary condition kj a very grim prospect quite depressing 
i know why gonna be long gone myself sc trillions of years trillions of years yes kj chuckle still 
idea that it cannot last forever but again it seems to be very woven up with space because if 
think that the driver for complexity is the ability of systems to reach out in space and kinda grab 
if you like from around themselves it seems like space is expanding faster than they can do that and 
will expand beyond the realms of the possibility so for example even if we manage to become a super 
that could harvest energy from all around us and managed to stop ourselves from going extinct and all the 
of it eventually the universe would just get so big that we find any of the energy anyway too 
away and too little of it is that fair to say sc yeah no completely true the way you 
say not sure that space is crucial in this particular case crucial is entropy again in the sense that 
have not reached the maximum of entropy that we can reach so as long as not at our maximum 
state still room for something interesting to happen for some complex structure to be there and persist and think 
love and care and die and write poetry but as you get closer and closer to maximum entropy less 
less room for anything complex and interesting to happen so the ultimate fuel crisis of the world energy is 
but entropy is not entropy goes up and so the difference between where we are and thermal equilibrium just 
with time and so right eventually be no more room left have used up all of our what we 
free energy the technical term the free energy will go to zero yeah and life will be over and 
only will they be no more living creatures no memory of you having ever existed sorry laughter kj really 
shame is there no way we can stop this like could an advanced technological civilization somehow stop this in 
sc so i think the answer is no and even in theory you you could imagine building something a 
so i think actually possible but within the realm of conceivably that you could make an artifact that recorded 
greatest deeds and lasted for an arbitrarily long period of time but what would be impossible is for anyone 
read that artifact because the act of reading and remembering increases the entropy of the universe and if at 
entropy that happen so consciousness itself thought and life cannot exist once reached equilibrium kj but assuming that the 
law is completely unchangeable is that the case sc yeah kj could we ever wind the clock back sc 
on the second law yeah there is something called the recurrence theorem that if you wait long enough if 
live in a universe where only a finite number of things that can happen truly finite number of things 
can happen not just that we can observe and then you will fluctuate back into a low entropy state 
that causes all sorts of problems with things like boltzmann brains and things like that and it it seems 
very clearly not be the universe we actually live in so i think that not only is it not 
universe we live in but it really ameliorate your problem because you send messages from one part of time 
another through the point of equilibrium so not a lot of room for talking to your future friends kj 
we find a way to borrow from here into an adjacent universe still in a very low entropy state 
borrow some of their entropy sc not according to any laws of physics that we know about them this 
good to think about if you this is very longterm planning the long now would be embarrassed about how 
their thinking compared to this kj grasping at straws here sc yeah no i know but as far as 
know no so what is possible is that a new universe will be born from ours that a baby 
will be born again no information will be conveyed from us to them but possible that what we think 
as the universe is just part of a bigger multiverse and more universes are constantly created and the way 
those universes are created naturally starts them in a low entropy state from which they can grow and things 
happen and in fact very possible in fact i proposed a theory which this is true that our universe 
from a preexisting universe in exactly that way but again they talk to each other as far as anyone 
the downside yeah laughter kj yeah very very impressive so can i ask you another question then something been 
to understand so a lot of these processes that talked about for example with the cream and the coffee 
the converse which seems to be a creation of order which is oil separating from water these changes in 
linked with entropy seem to depend on gravity and in fact everything seems to depend on gravity so the 
of stars and planets and life all dependent on gravity to what extent is gravity a fundamental part of 
or is it not sc well i think that part of a fundamental part let me very briefly mention 
oil and water separating actually increases entropy as that happens which it must because entropy increases but because of 
chemistry properties of hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules in the oil that actually a higher entropy configuration for them to 
not mixed than for them to be mixed once you go into details kj sure they need gravity for 
oil to be on the surface sc well even if you have gravity the oil and water would still 
from each other kj but form globules sc yeah be in globules so gravity does have that effect of 
or stratifying or whatever it is things in certain ways but only because also other forces so i think 
what is important is not gravity per se but the fact that there are different forces that work in 
directions so there can be a competition between them when things can become interesting when looking for an equilibrium 
some push and pull of gravity trying to push things together and say electromagnetism pushing them apart the fact 
we have these two forces that both act over long ranges in the universe gravity and electromagnetism seems to 
a minimal requirement for really interesting complex structures to form kj okay so again that being able to reach 
in space and time is a prerequisite for complexity and i guess you could think of the role of 
as being to bring things together to move things through space so they can interact in ways that they 
otherwise is sc yeah absolutely but you know gravity is subtle also even at the physics level which i 
saying correctly is way more simpleminded than the biological level on the one hand gravity pulls things together on 
other hand also the expansion of the universe it counts as gravity part of the geometry of spacetime which 
told us is what we think of as gravity so the fact that the universe is accelerating and eventually 
things apart is also gravity so the thing we understand cosmologically is why the universe started in such a 
entropy state with ten to the particles stuck into a region the size of a cubic centimeter which seems 
and then everything expanded and cooled from there to be billions of light years across but all gravity that 
both those things so gravity is your friend for a little while but then ultimately your enemy if you 
be a complex structure kj okay i know that gravity is driving the expansion of the universe can you 
that to a non physicists sc yeah two senses in which true one is just a very very blunt 
in which the size of the universe changing over time one way or the other is a gravitational phenomenon 
back in one thousand nine hundred fifteen explained that what gravity is is the curvature of spacetime and in 
universe that is more or less uniform through space one of the features of what we call the curvature 
spacetime is the changing size of the spatial universe the scale factor as we call it in general relativity 
tells us the relative distance between distant galaxies so the fact that galaxies are moving apart from each other 
moving through space space is growing and that is a phenomenon due ultimately to general relativity which is the 
of gravity there you go kj okay sc but then the extra new feature that at least in the 
days even though the expansion of the universe was part of our gravitational theory of general relativity at least 
was attractive at least it was slowing down but in when we discovered the acceleration of the universe we 
that there is probably something that we call the vacuum energy the cosmological constant which is pushing things away 
gravity not a new force sometimes people say we discovered a new force of nature but not right the 
force gravity the first force we ever discovered but a new kind of stuff the vacuum energy whose gravitational 
is to push things apart so there you go even gravity can have tricks up its sleeve kj so 
to link this to entropy then so i still kind of think of entropy as somewhat bound up with 
so for example the gas molecules that are in half the box versus the whole box and the probability 
finding one of those molecules in a particular place and so on and so on so if you suddenly 
the size of the box and all particles were on the one side then as entropy unfolded they would 
out across the box and naively it feels to me that the more space got the more microscopic configurations 
possible so does that sc true i would agree with that yeah kj the expansion of space is somehow 
up with how much entropy is possible sc yeah well slightly tricky i wanna say yes but i wanna 
put a footnote the thing that is a little bit hard to internalize is that the expansion of space 
part of the physical system so when you say how much entropy is possible you really fix space at 
certain size this is just a feature of general relativity you can always make space bigger one of the 
that can happen so unlike good old classical statistical mechanics when you would talk about putting gas in a 
and fixing the boundaries of the box if your box is the universe you have to allow the box 
expand just part of the dynamics so when we say that in the early universe there was a cubic 
where all the particles that we now see in the universe were somehow confined in a relatively smooth distribution 
quite legit to say calculate all the ways we could arrange those ten to particles inside a cubic centimeter 
compare them to how many ways we could arrange the particles today and say that the possible entropy has 
sc because among the weird things about that initial condition is that it was small within the cubic centimeter 
you separate out the arrangements of the particles inside the box from the size of the box itself so 
lesson is still true that yes the entropy was very low back then it is much larger now but 
that the allowed entropy went up just that we ever coming close to accessing the allowed entropy of that 
time kj so what determines the allowed entropy then if that if you you seem to be saying that 
meaningful to say to talk about the number of ways that you can arrange all of those particles in 
centimeter sc well you can talk about that but you say the maximum entropy right because you could say 
i can make the box bigger and even bigger entropy allowed to be kj so i see the problem 
thinking i have two reference friends in my head at the same time one is the centimeter square universe 
all the particles jammed in and unable to move so therefore low entropy you rearrange them sc where can 
go yeah kj and then the other one is a large universe where the could be all over the 
and that feels like a lot more ways that you could do that and a very high entropy but 
you saying that it does sc all completely correct kj you have those two reference frames at the same 
sc well you what you say sorry yet another subtlety here yet other subtlety when matter is extremely densely 
as it was in the early universe gravity not just over the expansion of the universe scales but gravity 
gravitational pull of the particles on each other was really important very densely packed that makes perfect sense when 
is very densely packed high entropy mean smooth anymore in a box of gas a high entropy configuration is 
smooth uniform configuration but when gravity when the mutual gravity between the particles becomes important you increase entropy by 
things lumpier sc like in the current universe you could make a black hole the black hole the center 
our galaxy has more entropy than all the particles in the known universe so the fact that the entropy 
very the configuration was very smooth at early times is itself a low entropy fact not only that everything 
packed into a tiny region of space which is true and low entropy but also it was smooth which 
low entropy sc so cosmologists some of my best friends professional cosmologists have this idea which is false that 
early universe had high entropy because they say it was smooth and it was hot and it was glowing 
a black body it looks like it was thermal equilibrium it looks like a box of and entirely wrong 
both it was a very small box of gas and because it was smooth even though gravity was important 
it was an anomalous low entropy state from any way you slice it sc so then been increasing ever 
and gonna keep increasing and fascinating and full employment for i think physicists and biologists to study the specifics 
the ways in which increasing so cosmologists will talk about forming black holes and then evaporating and biologists will 
about all of these complex structures acting as entropy engines what life does in some sense kj yeah yeah 
mean i was interested in idea of life as being a sort of temporary reversal of entropy i came 
that concept a long time ago and always always struck me not obviously wrong i think he accept it 
but at the same time it did always plant this idea why does life do that why did the 
not just drift out and defuse and not only has it formed but it continues to do more and 
and more crazy and interesting things i just think amazing sc well i think one way of that i 
about it but this is very primitive and we should be able to do better the space of possibilities 
really large when you have a lot of particles and a lot of places they could be in the 
and a lot of ways they could interact with each other and so forth a lot of things that 
happen and the journey from the early universe where entropy was low to the very very late universe where 
equilibrium is one of exploring that space because in equilibrium by definition sort of an equal probability to be 
any configuration but just because the set of configurations is so big sc not actually even in the ten 
the years that it takes the universe to equilibrate not gonna come close to actually exploring every single arrangement 
stuff within that universe so easy to say you explore more and more of the allowed face base or 
it is but the way in which that happens specifically is the crucial question when it comes to life 
complexity and things like and there i think you keep correctly emphasizing space matters because life is an organized 
itself low entropy thing that can exist only because increasing entropy elsewhere in space in some sense kj yeah 
the reason that life can do that is because of the spatial properties of the carbon atom because of 
three dimensional symmetrical structure able to build these amazing molecules that can reach out and make these as you 
these interactions across space and time so without carbon we have all of those and i find myself often 
whether this has ever happened anywhere else i used to assume that it must have in many places in 
universe but as time has gone on and i started to think actually maybe never happened anywhere else maybe 
is really unique the particular conditions that have allowed carbonbased life to form and remain stable maybe so unusual 
to be unique sc well i think had that thought also and my attitude is we have any data 
we have a lot of data about the fraction of other planets or other environments that have life on 
so we should be very openminded maybe within our observable universe the earth is the only planet that ever 
life form on it certainly another option which is that since life seem to catch on pretty quickly on 
but multicellular life took a very long time to form or eukaryotic life or something like that took a 
time to form maybe those are the hard parts and when we visit other planets be some sort of 
cyanobacteria all over the place but nothing more interesting kj yeah well they probably think interesting and been a 
more successful than we look like gonna be sc maybe maybe but you bring up this question of the 
of carbon so i wonder about that too obviously carbon is crucial for life as we know it but 
we just so chauvinistic about that if the chemistry of carbon were completely different open to the possibility that 
could have formed in some very bizarre to us but very different way kj yeah i know enough biochemistry 
i think there are one or two other atoms that might have the structure or the ability to form 
tetrahedral bonds and so on but these long stable polymers that carbon can conform that enables us to grow 
incredibly complex little machines that constitute all the enzymes and things sc if we were very advanced if we 
max type mark we would wonder about could life exist if space were onedimensional versus twodimensional versus threedimensional versus 
which is fine to do which is fun but the answer always is that it can only happen when 
and i just really worry that being blinded by our the noses in front of our faces when it 
to that we know how it works in this case we see how it would work in other cases 
a little bit more skeptical that it just we know how it would kj yeah one thing we do 
is we see any signs of it when we look into the cosmos so if there is other life 
gotten sufficiently advanced to be able to make signals that we can detect sc right we know the correct 
wrong with but the current stateoftheart is we know if all the exo planets ever seen are covered in 
right kj not sure why would we not know that sc just the current state of the art give 
a lot of information about kj so we have enough spectroscopic information sc i think it yeah i think 
the planets are faint compared to their stars but before we get too crazy in our speculations i do 
bring things a little bit downtoearth again because easy for me to say that complexity comes and then goes 
i think you very correctly want to emphasize the nonsmoothness of that evolution over time in the real world 
you say a little bit more about the origin of these catastrophes i know that specific catastrophes that we 
about are there general features of catastrophes that decrease the complexity of a system at least biologically if not 
generally kj well i think the catastrophes that have occurred for life on earth in fact there have been 
a few paleo biologists have identified five major extinctions but i mean extinctions are happening all the time and 
extinction rate increases and decreases but there have been a few really big ones some of these have been 
by changes in the earth itself so massive volcanic activity and so on but the ones that interest me 
the ones that were due to life something that happened in evolution that suddenly changed the distribution of life 
i think probably the first really notable one was the great oxygenation event that really completely changed the chemistry 
earth kj and then there was the cambrian substrate revolution that i mentioned when life forms discovered how to 
and then how to burrow through the substrate another big one that was quite surprising to me is that 
life came out of the oceans and onto land and trees formed suddenly there was a massive increase in 
and a pulling of carbon dioxide out of the air and that plummeted the temperature of the earth and 
an ice age and then of course the one that doing now completely changing the chemistry of the planet 
seeing a massive extinction and again because managed to proliferate enough to have global effects on the planets chemistry 
those i find those quite interesting worrying but interesting because this is life exploring the parameter space and then 
now and then it finds itself in a dead end sc yeah i think that the lesson of all 
your examples is that these catastrophes were all driven by progress right like life discovered a new way to 
something exciting and fun and did it a little bit too enthusiastically right and then lead to the extinction 
a whole bunch of other life forms kj yeah yeah so you when you develop a new ability to 
your reach in space and time lay general sorts of paths and some of those paths will lead you 
bigger and greater things but other paths will lead you to catastrophe evolution is full of dead ends and 
tell in advance which is gonna be the dead ends and which are not but particularly interesting because we 
far as we know are the first species that have been able to know this and to contemplate our 
and the possible regions of the space that we can explore and to make choices theoretically but the question 
does the dynamics of our interactions among ourselves allow those choices to be made or are we condemned to 
follow this path gonna lead us off a cliff and i i know the answer sc yeah i think 
way of thinking about the evolution of life is not only an evolution of complexity in terms of the 
that make the physical organism but an evolution of the sophistication with which we deal with information right the 
rna or dna molecules actually carried some information and that was crucial obviously and then there was this sort 
differentiation of information when you got to eukaryotic life and mitochondrial dna and nuclear dna and so forth and 
multicellular life more differentiation and then when the brain came along and the nervous system you could think and 
could have selfawareness and now that we have language you can think symbolically and these are all information processing 
forward so i think another wonderful frontier in science is to think about insights from information theory and how 
relate to physical evolution both of the universe and of the biology within it kj yeah yeah oh one 
the things that fascinate me about that is the equivalence been made between entropy and information sc mmhmm kj 
some sense as these information processing engines if you like brains are performing their own entropic manipulations by virtue 
how they operate in different domains at the chemical level but also this kind of more abstract level which 
think is fascinating sc yeah no i think like i said gonna be full employment for future scientists because 
some sense the way i like to think of it well let me back up a little bit because 
get confused when you talk about entropy and information because information theorists define the relationship between entropy and information 
exactly the opposite way to how physicists define it because information theory grew out of claude shannon talking about 
to send signals over wires and you send information more efficiently through a code that is high entropy because 
entropy means you know what letters come in next every time you get a letter you get some new 
very useful right sc so information theorists or communication theorists like to link high entropy with high information content 
a physicist who thinks about the cup of coffee not a message over the wires says in a low 
state if you tell me that in a low entropy state then i know a lot about what state 
because only a few of those states that look like that so i have more information about the system 
in a low entropy and i think that for this discussion that having right now that definition of entropy 
is more germane i think that in some sense because the universe started in a very low entropy state 
started with a lot of information in some sense builtin and all been we been increasing the information content 
the universe by having life or thoughts or books been degrading it because entropy is increasing but been using 
taking advantage of the fact that that information is all around us in more and more interesting ways sc 
breaking the universe up into these subsystems that manipulate information is a wonderfully truthful way i think of thinking 
life and species and evolution kj right so interesting is another way of saying complex i guess sc yeah 
so you could say that the universe started off with a lot of information but not much interest sc 
kj and now it has less informative but more interesting is that fair to say sc yeah and i 
this is something that you get at with your questions about space and interactions and things like that because 
universe as a whole increases in entropy and decreases in information but it gets shuffled around in interesting ways 
certain parts of the universe like you and me can hopefully take advantage of the overall degradation of information 
us to make life interesting as we go chuckle kj i feel like we are living at an optimum 
in the evolution of complexity in the universe where it is maximally interesting chuckle sc well they might have 
that years ago too so kj true sc they know right kj the question is are we at the 
of the hill or is it can we still climb a little bit higher sc well i think that 
you have correctly pointed out is that no inevitability in this increase in complexity like sure maybe a trend 
a tendency but also this very definite empirical record of catastrophes right and so when you see a stumping 
into the atmosphere and the sea levels rising and stuff like that be sanguine that yeah life is resilient 
everything will be we could hurt it really badly kj yeah a very good takehome message sc are you 
overall about how gonna do kj not optimistic but hopeful is that possible sc hopeful chuckle kj i like 
think there there are things we could do but if you if you asked me to put a probability 
it probably have to say it was lowish sc lowish well yeah well i hope not but all we 
do lessening the probability is less important than trying to increase the probability kj i completely agree sc i 
the thing to do alright kj i think if any species can do it then us sc there you 
put it that way i like that the cats are not gonna save us believe me i have two 
and not gonna stop global climate change in any way kate jeffery thanks so much for being on the 
it was tremendously fun conversation sc thank you very much music she is amazing what an intellect i love 
podcast she asked the questions of you that i would if i was smart enough to form them thank 
for sharing this fantastic podcast fantastic transcript great most interested in the philosophical implications of this some of which 
touched on at the end the relationship between entropy and information also the implications for natural language and communication 
information and how our human and thus contingent identification and definition of macroscopic states may be analogous in the 
of language to the differentiation and observation of said states seems like all these processes are informational exchanges of 
sort or another i just listened to the beginning of this so far i believe that the answer dr 
of why a dna strand of random nucleotides or of degraded dna would have different entropy content from a 
strand with genes containing the information to make a viable organism is that entropy also applies to information content 
need to go back and look at this but i took melanie introduction to complexity some years ago and 
think entropy applies because there are many more ways to send a signal with little or no information content 
a signal with large information content there are many more ways for a strand of dna to be or 
series of random nucleotides than there are ways for a dna strand to contain information so i think that 
that a dna strand with little or no information content has lower entropy than a dna strand with information 
hope i have this right i have learned much of what i know about entropy from you as well 
from melanie mitchell but i am always having to review which is high and which is low oh my 
i am so sorry i got her name wrong right on another personal favorite right up there with and 
a couple of others but then a bioengineer analytical and applied interested in future and big picture issues so 
lol sean still hoping here that one of these days get around to expanding on your and related ideas 
if just along the lines of creative philosophizing or the like as sagan for eg would do i help 
think it points to a new kind of framework with infrastructure along with new exciting energizing inventions and innovations 
science informed science abiding and science respecting yay obrigada sean carroll e kate jeffery outro episódio espetacular é minha 
que deveria haver uma maior discussão proatividade entre as vareas subareas da ciência e filosofia da ciência à semelhança 
episódio obrigada the concepts around entropy and the arrow of time fascinate me eternity to is one of the 
books read what intrigues me the most is the use of the to overcome which in the way stated 
a mere all the way down to the big kind of tautology more than anyone else kate jeffery made 
your what good philosophy is all about cats are not going to save no no they the ones go 
entropy i really tease out and bother me could any one talked about it and i dont understand why 
the universe cause the increase entropy of the universe strictly speaking entropy is a property of a set of 
states spec the log of the number of those states not a property of a single quantum state and 
universe at any moment is in a single quantum state therefore the universe does not have an entropy comments
