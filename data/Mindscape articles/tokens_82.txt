sure that most of the listeners remember back just february twoandahalf years ago i guess by now when scientists 
the first direct detection of gravitational waves from elsewhere in the universe the ligo observatory the laser interferometric gravitational 
observatory announced that they had seen these signals of black holes thirty times the mass of the sun spiraling 
each other a billion years ago giving off gravitational waves and we have finally detected them they were actually 
back in september of and then announced in february and enormous excitement because of this a truly groundbreaking discovery 
though been anticipating it for years and years one of those things which will go down in the textbooks 
in the history books as a real cornerstone of how we think about the universe what is less clear 
the enormous amount of not only work but perseverance that went into this discovery sc always a lot of 
to do an enormous experiment or observation in physics or astronomy if you discovered the higgs boson you have 
build the large hadron collider and that takes ten dollars billion and many many years and thousands of people 
the difference being that i wanna in any way disparage the people who found the higgs boson i did 
a book about them and i admire them enormously but they kind of knew it was there and how 
find it right they were following a tradition of high energy particle physics they had to invent new technology 
so forth but the basic path had been laid whereas with gravitational waves there were a lot of people 
thought that there just any gravitational waves of sufficient magnitude to be found or even more people who thought 
even if there were we be able to build a detector with a sufficient sensitivity to actually find them 
guest is kip thorne who along with ray weiss and ron drever was a driving force behind the ligo 
collaboration all the way since the and so much effort involved not only intellectually as a theorist thorne would 
to figure out how many sources of gravitational waves there are in the universe how strong they would be 
they would look like in the detector and so forth but also navigating the waters of getting funding and 
support from the community over a course of decades to build this enormous machine and ligo in particular had 
history where the first version of ligo really expected to see anything they spent a billion dollars to build 
that they expect to see anything in the sky and they were right they had to upgrade it to 
is called advanced ligo before they eventually saw something so it was really a testimony to human kind in 
sense because we really stuck with it but certain particular examples exemplars of humankind who made it happen and 
thorne is absolutely one of them sc of course kip is a very famous scientist for many reasons written 
done enormous amounts of research in other areas of gravitational physics his expertise one of his famous results was 
the idea that you can use wormholes as time machines as long as you first find a wormhole you 
be able to travel backward in time that was kip and his students who originally came up with that 
and this led to his second career as a movie writer and producer kip was also one of the 
forces behind the movie interstellar so over the course of the podcast talk about ligo of course and gravitational 
but also quite a bit about time travel and moviemaking and things like that this is a really good 
i think gonna enjoy it and before we dive in let me just remind you that we have a 
page if you want to pledge a little bit of support per episode to mindscape and because of popular 
added a paypal page as well so if you like this recurring payment kind of idea you can just 
in one lumpsum whenever you want to sc all on the podcast webpage preposterousuniversecompodcast you can find the links 
the righthand side and i greatly appreciate it sometimes i say greatly appreciate but really the whole operation is 
here in my office so thanks for keeping the lights on here at mindscape very very gratifying to see 
support so go music sc kip thorne welcome to mindscape podcast kip thorne wonderful being here sc i mean 
your other distinctions sure that be very proud to know you are the first nobel prize winner to be 
for the mindscape podcast kt not sure that an honor or not nobel prize winners are usually sc no 
not true i was going to say i came very close to getting frances arnold on the podcast kt 
would be really cool sc there you go you see like all the other nobel prize winners are good 
there are a few yes sc yeah so you won last year not this year in but it was 
year right kt yes sc the nobel for gravitational waves sure people know the general story but before we 
into the physics was it mostly relief that helped when you finally discovered the gravitational waves or were you 
i mean a longterm project kt yeah for me it had been a half a century sc right kt 
long sc very long yeah you started young it was good laughter kt it consumed essentially all of my 
though as a theorist i was able to do a lot of other things on the side but more 
half my career was spent on it in terms of time for me when i woke up in the 
and i had an email from christian ott a good friend and a member of the collaboration saying go 
at this such and such a website we may have a and i went and looked at it it 
obvious it was too good to be true something had to be wrong it must have been what we 
a blind injection to test the system sc right this is right kt faking yourself sc intentionally putting in 
kt the best way to test the system is an endtoend test where a group of about something like 
or four members of the collaboration are assigned the test go in electronically wiggle in mirrors in this instrument 
his chip precisely what the gravity wave would do and then the wiggling in mirrors send a signal through 
whole system all the way through the electronics to the computer and then through the computer to the human 
and through the human beings to the point of writing a paper and then after the paper is written 
discover no that was a blind so been through that and i figured this is a blind injection obviously 
it but we were absolutely sure for several months really sc so even you get told right kt oh 
not i might be the last one to be told laughter kt so it gradually became clear that this 
probably the real thing and my reaction was simply one of profound satisfaction that i had indeed put a 
fraction of my energy of my career in the right direction and direction that really paid off sc so 
kind of excitement you feel when told that your experiment has found something amazing what about the excitement you 
when you hear won the nobel prize kt well let me tell you about that so it was october 
last year in the morning a telephone call came in i think it was the secretary general of the 
academy of sciences i was asleep sound asleep it woke me up though i had been expecting it sc 
kt sc by the way for the audience out there everyone in the physics world thought that ligo would 
the nobel prize kt yes so at the other end he announces himself he says will not surprise you 
we are awarding the nobel prize to rainer weiss at mit barry barish in new york and i responded 
not surprise me but exceedingly and he was a bit taken aback sc right not usually what he hears 
this is not usually what he hears but i said to him prize should have gone to the ligo 
who pulled this off and not to just three people in this case this could never have been done 
the three of us it really was a team effort and i thought you had learned your lesson about 
in the case of the nobel prize for the higgs boson several years ago it should have gone to 
sc well it went to three theorists and zero experimenters kt right it should have gone to the experimenter 
at least maybe some theorists too sc yeah kt and so he said been discussing that but we do 
we give it to and he said we can continue this discussion in laughter kt so we went into 
cycle and we did continue sc right kt and i told him in no uncertain terms the nobel committee 
an obligation to educate the public about the importance of collaborations there are some kinds of major scientific breakthroughs 
can only be done by a big collaboration and that the process of collaboration is absolutely crucial for success 
not doing a good job of educating the public about that and he said he said been sensitive to 
there are a number of members of the committee that agree that our principal goal with the nobel prize 
to educate the public about the importance of science the value of science what has been done and three 
are better icons for science than a big and so how the conversation went and still struggling with this 
sc be honest i get that argument i have strong feelings one way or the other i think that 
your goal of the prize was to do the best possible job honoring good science then clear that the 
team should win but i mean obviously winning it does change the lives of the individual winners but maybe 
best public thing that it does is bring the excitement of science to a wider audience and identifying some 
human faces with that is the right way to go i really know kt yeah well that may be 
case but the breakthrough prize which is only in physics but it is a huge sc i think some 
version too kt yeah right i guess right right anyway the breakthrough prize does it in a manner that 
and with ligo they gave two thirds of the prize to the collaboration and one third to three individuals 
i thought that worked well sc yeah they give the peace prize kt organizations sc groups peace prizes and 
for other reasons and i know other prizes my friend brian schmidt who helped discover the accelerating universe sort 
insisted for some prizes that rather than it be himself it should be the team but the nobel said 
work that but it might change i know do you think that open to changing down the road kt 
think some of them are open to change and i was told they do have the power to change 
is not set in stone legally by alfred will sc yeah apparently alfred will is very different than what 
actually do anyway right so kt yeah yeah yeah laughter sc do you think i know that richard feynman 
a story or an article called alfred other mistake do you think that overall the good for science kt 
think it is it is more effective at reaching broadly throughout the world to nonscientists and giving them some 
of the importance the power and the beauty of science more effective than anything else that we have sc 
and so fifty years ago what were you thinking what do what was well i guess i wanna ask 
what was the opinion about gravitational waves and so forth but for those out there in podcast land what 
a gravitational wave kt a gravitational wave can be described heuristically as a ripple in the fabric or the 
of space or of space and time that is produced in our case by two colliding black holes travels 
the universe bringing information about its source the word ripple is meant to evoke the idea of a ripple 
the surface of a pond if you throw a pebble into the pond and a very quiet pond you 
the waves propagating out in fact these waves are quite different where as the surface of the pond is 
it goes up and down and up and down in a wave here what happens is space is stretched 
then scrolls in one direction perpendicular to the direction the wave is propagating and then in the other perpendicular 
it scrolls and it stretches that a stretch on one direction and a squeeze on the other now what 
it mean for space to be stretched and squeezed sc yeah kt we could just think of particles or 
tiny asteroids out there floating in space as the wave goes by and at rest with respect to each 
initially and they each ride on the stretching and squeezing space and so they get pushed a part and 
together apart and together and so the distance between them changes sc and this is something where people had 
about it for a long time einstein it sort of went back and forth as i recall his opinion 
whether or not these were even a real thing changed over time kt it did there were times when 
lost faith in gravitational waves and very quickly however he recovered and realized well yeah they ought to be 
but it was controversial among theorists who worked in relativity theory at least among some fraction of the community 
the way up into the and so really quite surprising it took so long for the community to totally 
this out sc and what so difficult about figuring it out kt the difficulty is you have a theory 
mathematical theory and a question of truly understanding the physical consequences of the mathematics and to me it was 
but i was of the younger generation sc yeah kt and so i was taught in what i would 
the right way by my mentor john wheeler to think about it but to people of an earlier generation 
struggled to understand the mathematics it was not totally clear until after we started planning these gravitational wave detectors 
there a famous thought experiment by feynman that was trying to show that gravitational waves are physically real kt 
right and so one of the compelling things in which he said take a stick and put some beads 
the stick and a little bit of friction between the beads and the stick and when the gravitational waves 
by they move the beads back and forth because they can slide the stick is stiff and it resists 
stretched and squeezed so it move hardly at all because of its resistance the beads resist so the beads 
back and forth and they rub on the stick they heat the stick up and if you have strong 
waves they might even start a fire sc i just loved that example for so many reasons everyone else 
sitting there with equations trying to figure out what the symmetries are going on and he has this stick 
beads kt but he is relying on a particular equation called the of geodesic it was another physicist mathematical 
felix pirani who first said this is an equation we should be using to discuss gravitational so remark about 
was at a conference in chapel hill north carolina in one thousand nine hundred fiftysix or sc i think 
okay sc it been kt anyway felix pirani was almost that same time just within a year or so 
same time so the people identified really the right way mathematically to discuss waves until then and it was 
as far as aware who first gave this beautiful description but it did come from the mathematics and a 
about feynman who of course was a close friend of mine feynman would at conferences like this he would 
up with some really remarkable statement that would startle people and this was not the only one and if 
would then afterwards ask feynman did this come from where did you get this sudden he would say i 
some long calculations back several years ago just trying to understand how things work and once i understood i 
satisfied i need to write a paper describing this i just understood and i was sc just wait till 
right moment of the conference to pull it out as a sudden insight right kt but he was driven 
his own personal curiosity and he had enormous storehouse of information that came from the curiositydriven questions he had 
to himself over the decades sc i know about this among other things that this famous conference in chapel 
did is it helped launch the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics which thinking about that kt indeed it 
sc john wheeler was hugh advisor and richard advisor and your advisor kt yeah and john wheeler who promoted 
believe it sc he believe it no right but kt anyway a separate story sc separate story another podcast 
there was skepticism about gravitational waves there was arguably even more skepticism about black holes back in the day 
indeed indeed and for the same reason the issue of really understanding what the mathematics were saying was even 
in the case of black holes than gravitational waves so that skepticism also well that lasted i think up 
the early when it was finally laid to rest sc and about the time you started thinking about ligo 
gravitational waves more generally kt about the time i started thinking about the experiments so i was thinking about 
of gravitational waves beginning in the mid when i was john student and just finishing working with him it 
after joseph weber in had announced tentative evidence for gravitational waves that i really began thinking deeply about it 
deep as deeply as i could about experiments although i had been a champion enthusiast of weber earlier it 
really only triggered by that and it was one thousand nine hundred seventytwo that i wrote with bill press 
student of mine at the time my first paper about a vision for what you can do with gravitational 
if you could detect them and it was that same year that rayner weiss or ray as i call 
at mit he wrote a marvelous technical paper where he described his invention of the kind of gravitational wave 
we would ultimately build identified all of the major things that could go wrong all the major noise sources 
we say and described ways of dealing with each one and estimated what kind of accuracy you can get 
dealt with them all toward a force and that was really the beginning i think for him and for 
of the research that led directly to ligo sc and s a quick footnote ligo for those who know 
all if not been paying attention just probably a tiny fraction of the audience the laser interferometric gravitational observatory 
found gravitational waves but also for people who are not physics experts talk a little bit about the difference 
being a theorist such as yourself and being an experimenter or an instrument builder like ray weiss kt yeah 
not a very clean distinction between the two but most physicists work essentially entirely on theory developing models for 
universe or for things that happen in the universe mathematical models trying to understand the consequences of experiments that 
been done in the past and the implication for things you might do in the future but working with 
and with physical intuition to try to deduce going on in the universe from observation and mathematical laws of 
an experimenter designs experiments builds apparatus to perform them in order to investigate the laws of nature and their 
so ray weiss a consummate experimenter who also understands theory quite deeply but focused his career on experiment primarily 
the primary designer and inventor of these gravitational wave detectors though the basic idea underlying them had been also 
independently by other people even earlier but he was the person who really built these and made them happen 
i was a theorist who set some vision for where we might be going but i also spent along 
my students a lot of time and energy helping identify things that could go wrong in these gravitational wave 
and through theoretical calculations with the mathematics and physical understanding identifying ways to deal with them but i go 
and actually build the apparatus sc right right now that was a long sentence that i think you kt 
sorry sc no no it was good except i think that you said physicists are and i think that 
wanted to say most physicists are theorists or experimenters kt or experimenters yeah sc well probably a lot kt 
are theorists or experimenters but in my case and i think this was essential when i was a phd 
at princeton i had made a decision i was going to work in relativity relativity was a wonderful field 
thought it was going to take off it had been more abound for several decades and i knew it 
really only take off if it had some experimental underpinnings and so i actually spent much of a year 
on experiment just to prepare myself so i could interact with experimenters matter what kind of experiment i happened 
work in nuclear physics using a machine called a cyclotron and then in terms of research groups at princeton 
had worked within a theory research group led by john wheeler but i also participated in the weekly group 
and experimental research group that ray weiss was a postdoc in sc oh okay kt who was led by 
dickie a different professor and so i prepared myself for the possibility the likelihood that i would be able 
work at the interface between theory and experiment sc famous gravity group was partly responsible for major research in 
microwave background technically kt precisely sc yeah kt yes sc yeah so skip ahead and then we can come 
but what was the final product of all this thinking explain to us the ligo what it is how 
looks kt so ligo is a set of instruments called wave or wave that are designed to detect these 
waves coming from the distant universe and extract the information they carry so we could use that information to 
about the universe each of these instruments is something that measures the stretching and squeezing of space monitors the 
and squeezing of space monitors the pattern of stretch and squeeze what we have is we have four mirrors 
of them weighs about forty kilograms one hundred pounds sc that sound so bad i could do this in 
backyard right and i spend so much money kt right right yeah and they need to perfect mirrors and 
hang from overhead supports by quartz fibers sc i have any of those but amazon will probably sell me 
kt right right and you put two mirrors along one arm of an l and the other two along 
other arm so you have two arms that are perpendicular with mirrors at each end of an arm and 
the gravitational wave comes along it pushes the mirrors on one arm together while pushing the ones on the 
arm apart the amount of the push and squeeze is the relevant thing and for what we finally did 
it was the diameter of a proton or the nucleus of an hydrogen atom sc that seems very small 
that is about roughly a trillion times smaller than the wavelength of the light that we use to make 
measurement sc and these mirrors are kt these mirrors sc how far apart kt they are four kilometers apart 
is it underground or just in tubes kt in tubes sc that you shoot the laser down kt and 
the laser down the tube and so you use laser beams to monitor the stretching and squeezing using this 
interferometry but the key thing is how the hell do you measure motions in mirrors that are four kilometers 
when the motions are about a trillion times smaller than the wavelength of the light that using how do 
do it when that size is a hundred times smaller than a proton and a proton is a hundred 
times smaller than an atom and there you got lots of individual atoms in the face of this mirror 
talking about ten million times smaller than the individual atoms that make up the face of the mirror that 
jiggling around in the mirror all the time warm by the distances or aptitudes of motion that are also 
sc so if someone said you find the location of this proton to within this you would say but 
the changes in location due to the gravitational wave kt but measuring the changes in location of huge numbers 
them measuring actually the average position of all the atoms in the mirror and a big part of why 
you have to design your experiment as ray showed us how so that using light that bounces off the 
of these often jiggling faces thermally jiggling faces of these mirrors but you want the signal put under the 
to only be influenced by the motion of the center of the mirror and not by the jiggles of 
faces sc one of the things you had to worry about is just that any graduate student nearby who 
is gonna make the mirror jiggle by much more than the gravitational wave would jiggle it by right kt 
so to that graduate student better not be too close sc but there must be like baffles and noisecancelling 
yeah huge numbers of things to deal with and so why this thing this whole experiment it cost over 
billion us taxpayer dollars sc right right kt a huge amount because there are so many things that can 
wrong one way to describe how many things can go wrong is the number of data channels carrying information 
of the instrument and out of the environment that each of which could tell you something was going wrong 
not a hundred not a thousand not but data channels telling you things monitoring things that might go wrong 
that might go wrong kt and one data channel carrying gravitational wave information about the pattern of stretch and 
sc yeah about right about the challenge you face and how much of this was clear in or how 
you did come to it kt no it clear it was going to be that complex but one of 
best experimenters i ever worked with aside from ray and ron drever in caltech was vladimir braginsky in moscow 
was absolutely superb became a close personal friend and he was aside from joseph weber the other person the 
person to really jump into this field and make a mark he was enthusiastic about this but said it 
him because there were so many things that can go wrong that it was very dangerous to pursue this 
so he pursued a simpler approach through the and he came to visit caltech and mit where we were 
on ligo in the late looked at the progress looked at the plans went home and shut down his 
operation and joined ligo he joined our effort but he was superb and he was just so very skeptical 
about fifteen years because of the complexity that these instruments would have to have sc and one of the 
was certainly like what if the instrument work perfectly well but nothing out there making large enough gravitational waves 
see right kt no i worried about that laughter sc not hooked up to a polygraph right now kt 
was worry in the community but it seemed clear to me not with confidence but up in the confidence 
at least that we would have black holes that orbit around each other and merge the neutron stars that 
around each other and merged and those already became our primary sources that we were planning to go after 
dictated things about the design of these instruments already by about sc and were you surprised at the exact 
that you saw was it what when they saw the first event kt yeah sc was announced in kt 
it was precisely what i had expected except the black holes were a little heavier than i expected sc 
times the mass of the sun each kt yeah and i figured maybe fifteen times the mass of the 
each but again this is what i had been expecting since about we knew enough about the universe that 
seemed like a pretty good bet about the universe and about these instruments a key part of that knowledge 
that heavier objects aim at stronger waves and so black holes if they were fifteen times heavier than the 
that makes them ten times heavier than a neutron star and our primary sources we thought were in fact 
things we have seen neutron stars orbiting around each other colliding black holes doing the same thing with the 
holes ten times heavier you can see them ten times farther that means the volume of the universe you 
see them through is ten cubed the cube for the three dimensions of space a thousand times greater volume 
it just seemed very likely to me that the number of black holes it would be less than neutron 
but it would be less by a factor maybe one hundred not one thousand and so that would be 
first thing we saw that is what we saw and what i was aiming for as the most likely 
to happen sc and these events are quite rare on a galaxy by galaxy basis right i mean in 
galaxy how often do two thirty solarmass black hole coalesce do you have a guess laughter kt one in 
millions years sc yeah okay right but a lot of galaxies out there how we learn right kt right 
sc what have we learned about the universe so far by these experimental results kt well learned that black 
do collide and merge that they do form binaries as we expected similar in neutron stars sc but not 
we truly know that for sure until then kt no we know that for sure to me one of 
most interesting things we have learned is the fact that when two black holes collide colliding two objects that 
from matter they have no solid surface they have nothing solid in them at all made only from warped 
and warped time and so when they collide and merge they create a veritable storm in the shape of 
in the rate of flow of time while oscillating rate of flow of time while oscillating shape of space 
the surface of the ocean in a huge storm out at sea and we know anything about storms and 
fabric of space and time even theoretically until maybe three or four years ago and just a little bit 
we discovered gravitational waves from these things the supercomputer simulations solving equations on supercomputers began to tell us about 
storms we have now seen the waves from these storms the agreement between the predictions of the simulations and 
observations is absolutely remarkable and so for the first time now we have both a theoretical understanding and an 
verification of storms in the fabric of space and time sc and i think that an aspect of the 
that maybe as popularly appreciated as it could be we have general relativity theory of space and time he 
us what we call an equation equation but in some sense really multiple equations talking to each other and 
complicated to solve and you get complicated interesting solutions on pencil and paper you need a computer and just 
number of years ago the idea of getting accurate realworld useful numerical calculations from equation seemed very very difficult 
not feasible right kt precisely and the action and the effort to create the technology and the techniques for 
simulations for solving equations on computers lasted just as long as our experimental effort lasted half a century and 
the early well in the i was following that effort with great interest because i was expecting that the 
things we would see would be colliding black holes and we be able to say for sure what we 
seeing unless we had predictions and predictions required these simulations we would need the predictions to compare with the 
in order to deduce the details of what the black holes were doing the details of these storms and 
progress was painfully slow i was chairing an advisory committee to the collaboration of all the leading groups in 
world and trying to do these simulations and as the chair of their advisory committee i was a aghast 
the slowness of that progress kt i mean it was very hard it they were dumb they are the 
people in the world but it was very very hard and so in fact i personally left the ligo 
in terms of daytoday involvement in the early in order to start a effort at caltech and doing these 
in collaboration with what i viewed as the strongest group in the world a group of saul teukolsky at 
in the early not that i wrote a code computer code anymore than i built the apparatus for ligo 
at least i had some sense of where we needed to be going and what questions needed to be 
and what accuracy is needed to be achieved and so forth in these simulations and so where i was 
my effort when the gravitational waves were discovered i was not a major participant in the end game experimentally 
but we did make amazing we the royal we made quite impressive progress over the last ten years kt 
and huge progress on the simulations and huge progress experimentally and the two came together on just the time 
that was required and it was the marriage of the simulations with the observations that really led to our 
able to understand indepth what was being seen sc so where does a thirty solar mass black hole come 
much less a pair of two thirty solar mass black holes right next to each other ready to coalesce 
no you tell me laughter kt these were not expected they were not expected of course in many maybe 
most cases when something unexpected is seen theorists can come up with explanations sc right we have options we 
know which right kt yeah kt right coming up with options and so my the option that i think 
most likely to turn out to be true is that you begin with smaller black holes that form inside 
we call globular clusters or big clusters of stars and they sink to the bottom of the cluster through 
interactions with the smaller stars with less massive stars they sink to the bottom they find each other they 
and merge and then that merged hole merges with another merged hole and you build up fairly quickly to 
thirty solar mass black holes sc and these are very different than the supermassive black holes we have at 
centers of galaxies kt they are very different the so we dealing with thirty solar mass black holes the 
at the center of our own galaxy is about four million times the mass of the sun the one 
the center of the andromeda galaxy the nearest big galaxy to our own is more like one hundred million 
the mass of the sun so they are completely different kinds of beasts sc is there any hope for 
day seeing those in gravitational waves kt yes sure we will see them sc will ligo see them kt 
sc ligo has and does have a prayer ligo so the bigger the black holes when they merge the 
the oscillations of the waves as they pass which means the longer the wavelength of the waves and on 
earth when you get down to those oscillations that are this slow and now talking about ten minutes an 
ten hours noise on the earth is horrendous sc yeah a lot of things happening with our time scales 
a lot of things happen in our time this is hopeless on earth you have to get away from 
earth and far away from the earth and noise on the earth that comes from weather humans and so 
and so that has to be done out in interplanetary space sc and also you would like to have 
mirrors or the equivalent of your mirrors roughly ten light minutes apart right kt that right right sc and 
big is the earth in lightsecond kt well about a of a lightsecond sc okay there you go kt 
few tenths about a tenth or a few hundredths of a light second kt okay and so we had 
plan when i was a kid there was this plan called lisa to put satellites in space that would 
lasers off of each other and people then decided it was too expensive but then you and your friends 
gravitational waves and an effort to bring it back do you have any idea how going kt well i 
the history is a little different from that sc oh okay kt i think the problem is that the 
had a cost a big cost overrun on james webb space telescope and nasa pulled out of a signed 
with the european space agency to do this mission sc yeah okay kt it was not the first time 
nasa pulled out of agreements with so the europeans were getting accustomed to this sc the us is not 
great partner for some of these big long term missions kt a result of the nature of our political 
not something that nasa can control a result of the congressional election system and the way things swing with 
administrations unfortunately for science but anyway so nasa pulled out and then it was too expensive for the europeans 
to do right so they scaled the mission down they made it less robust in a way that was 
quite dangerous but in order to be able to do it now as you were saying now the gravitational 
have been seen by ligo but fast gravitational waves rapidly oscillating not the slow ones that lisa would see 
that been seen and the europeans have flown test apparatus that verifies that the most serious sources of noise 
had been identified are under control we expect lisa to be on a fast track very likely with nasa 
as a junior partner not an equal partner sc well what they get kt yeah what happens and in 
the chinese are pushing very hard to do a simpler analogue to lisa faster sc oh okay kt so 
are the first ones to see these gravitational waves in space sc but that can often be very very 
right kt yeah right sc just a quick dirty thing just to see the scope of the land and 
go back and do it right kt yeah sc yeah and this is one of the things that again 
we take for granted but is worth emphasizing is albert einstein one hundred years ago almost a little bit 
one hundred years ago from very thought experimenty kind of inputs right like there was no data that said 
have to throw out newtonian roughly speaking but he had principles he knew about special relativity he knew about 
things that he wanted to be true the principal equivalence then he came up with general relativity which both 
and i have written textbooks about by the way competitors in that way kt well hardly competitors my textbook 
written decades before your textbook sc but you sold a lot more copies than i have kt yeah we 
today nearly what you sell i think sc though making younger ones sure sc and he was right and 
some sense not only was he right about the predictions for the experiments which it took us like you 
years to figure out but the feature the fact that spacetime is curved and that curvature is gravity still 
about what that really means at a deep level is that fair to say kt yes i think very 
to say sc what do you think is the future what do we get need to learn about spacetime 
general relativity even though we have the equation written down kt well thus far the key thing the recent 
and the thing that excites me for the next five years maybe a little longer is understanding these storms 
the shape of space and time so for example come to understand first through computer simulations and then understanding 
in the equations directly that sticking out of each spinning black hole is a twisting vortex of space sc 
kt very much like the twist of a tornado so two tornados sticking out of a black hole one 
them at the north pole of the black hole it has a counterclockwise twist of space the south pole 
clockwise twist of space and these vortices when you have two black holes collide and merge you wind up 
with four vortices sticking out of a merged black hole plus two more vortices that were created by the 
angular momentum so you can have as many as six vortices sticking out black holes like to have any 
than two sc right kt and so these vortices have to fight with each other in some manner and 
a shakedown to two vortices so very interesting behavior of empty space sc yeah yeah i kt we had 
idea about this until we saw some of this in simulations and then started thinking about it theoretically sc 
these black holes are spinning very rapidly we say those words but really just like you said empty space 
yeah sc as if they were spinning very rapidly right so if i fall into one of these black 
can i travel across the universe kt probably not kt almost certainly not sc well how would i then 
across the universe if i wanted to do that i think this is a leading question i know a 
colleague of yours back in the day asked a similar question of you kt yeah well a guy a 
friend carl sagan sc yeah kt had written a novel called contact well hes originally written the screenplay and 
he turned it into a sc oh i know that kt when the screenplay was getting made into a 
very fast sc why would anyone make the movie like that kt anyway so he wanted his heroine who 
jodie foster to travel through a black hole to the vicinity of the star vega and so he sent 
the page proofs of his book he was already sc he waited a long time yeah i know kt 
he said know i realize i might be in trouble can you help and i read them driving up 
i think it was driving up to see my daughter graduate from uc santa cruz sc okay kt i 
them in the car and fired off a response and said you do it with black holes gonna die 
a short movie sc yes kt and so you want to use a wormhole and a hypothetical object that 
somewhat similar to a black hole in the sense that it has a spherical mouth but sort of like 
horizon of a black hole except you can travel two ways through this mouth you can travel in and 
out and you go through it and it leads to another place in the universe sc and just so 
in getting in trouble with the physics police here black holes really exist wormholes not only are hypothetical but 
i mean what are the chances that wormholes exist in the real world kt i think the chances that 
exist naturally are exceedingly small the chances that they can be made by a very advanced civilization are bigger 
still small and if they get made by an advanced civilization they probably implode before you can travel through 
the chances that the civilization can stabilize them so you can travel through again are small but not zero 
but not zero kt and so the issue is that motivated by carl question and by my suggesting that 
use wormholes in what became the movie contact i and other of my physicist colleagues started working hard to 
to understand do the laws of physics allow them and it was obvious already from the beginning that it 
unless you did something very strange with them they would selfdestruct they would implode and trying to sort that 
and to my surprise we get it sorted out fully but the work that has been done points rather 
to a conclusion that probably they exist and if they can exist they very probably exist naturally sc yeah 
this was circa late early you were thinking about this kt so the work on this continues to today 
a small level the bulk of the research on this was done late early to mid but it still 
because the answer in sc right we still know so carl sagan wants to let ellie arroway travel across 
galaxy you say it should be a wormhole not a black hole and then you realize wormholes were again 
by john wheeler is that true the phrase kt so the phrase was coined by john wheeler the concept 
goes back to herman vile about sc i did not know that i would have given einstein credit kt 
so it was conceived perhaps independently by einstein and his colleague rosen einstein and rosen in the but you 
back and back and you find it in herman vile in about but it was john wheeler who really 
hard to understand these initially because he had intuition which may have been right that on very small scales 
we call the the scale where space and time as we know them must become probabilistic they fluctuate like 
in the universe fluctuates due to quantum physics on those very small scales john wheeler argued that you would 
find a froth of fluctuating wormholes sc right kt and so that was his central focus sc this rough 
maybe this is getting a little bit too technical but i resist so einstein gives us this equation for 
relativity equation and we might wanna say well why you just solve the equation and part of the problem 
a lefthand side which says spacetime is curved and a righthand side which says stuff in the universe matter 
energy and so forth causing space time to curve and the lefthand side with the curvature is very pretty 
understandable and the righthand side with stuff is kind of a mess is that about why we understand wormholes 
well kt well maybe a piece of it a piece of it because although wormholes are things that are 
from warp space time without matter if you have them made from warp space time without matter then they 
sc right kt so you have to put some kind of matter in them to hold them open and 
it becomes tough sc were the rest of physics and all a messy terrible thing kt the other issue 
this was the issue for wheeler is that when you get down to these very tiny length scales associated 
quantum effects that there you even know the correct laws of physics at all well and so then you 
to start speculating and where he gave i think some pretty plausible arguments that you would have this quantum 
of fluctuating wormholes but there the problem is you understand the laws of physics for a big wormhole you 
the matter well enough to be sure that whether you can hold the wormhole open with it sc but 
you have a big wormhole and you can use it to travel across the galaxy very quickly you worry 
special relativity says i go faster than the speed of light like going backward in time kt oh come 
sc leading you down somewhere kt sure you can go faster than the speed of light we all know 
not locally so be more precise in things the universe is expanding as we know a cosmologist you can 
this far better than i do sean laughter sc and the most distant part of the universe is moving 
from us faster than the speed of light so we see it light get to us from it but 
it and so what the speed limit really says is that if you have two objects that are close 
to each other that there is no significant warping of space and time between them then they move faster 
the speed of light with respect to each other but when got a wormhole got lots of warping with 
and time and all bets are off kt right so you can and ever since i know if contact 
the first movie to use wormholes to get people across sc i think so kt and now every movie 
it so yeah star trek and everybody else kt but then i know whether it was you or your 
but you began to realize that if you can travel across great distances of space maybe you can also 
backward in time sc yeah yeah so that was me in this case i mean other people had working 
relativity had seen other ways that you might be able to go backward in time this was just one 
way but one that became particularly popular maybe because of contact overlapping conversation sc although to be more fair 
would say that it you could imagine building it a lot of the other ways to build time machines 
by saying you have an infinitely long right sc and at least the wormhole is contained in some region 
yeah once you have a wormhole kt once you have wormhole sc so with a couple of my students 
morris and ulvi yurtsever i worked out how you if you had a wormhole how you would use it 
make a time machine fairly simple you just take one mouth and i put my wife in one mouth 
carries that mouth out through the universe in her spaceship and comes back at high speed and time for 
slows down as seen in the external universe and i sit on earth it slow down but as seen 
the wormhole our clocks run at the same rate and so you begin the clocks always running at the 
rate hers and mine as seen through the wormhole when she comes back very young and very old as 
through the exterior as seen through the interior of the wormhole the same age and so something crazy going 
the craziness is that you have created a time machine kt right sc so that was fairly simple and 
obvious but i think yes right this was something that if you had a wormhole you could actually make 
and so then the question became what did the laws of physics say about this could you really do 
and there comes in the key thing that if an engineer in a very advanced civilization and you can 
anything that is allowed by the laws of physics you got to look at more than the laws of 
the laws of relativity say sure you can make a time sc yeah kt but you also got to 
at the laws of quantum physics and the behavior of matter always going to be some matter present because 
quantum physics always at least a little bit of fluctuating matter present and so then okay now got a 
turned into a time machine relativity allowed it what did quantum physics do what did it say and the 
is that quantum physics says with high probability that the wormhole is going to selfdestruct the moment you turn 
into this time machine sc it seems like from various different perspectives the universe is kind of reluctant to 
you build a time machine kt it does seem that way essentially laughter sc do would it bother you 
we could build the time machine i mean there are logical paradoxes involved right can we rig overlapping conversation 
i think it would be wonderful laughter kt anything that says that the laws of nature are different than 
expect is wonderful you can learn wonderful things sc is that how you knew in the early to think 
gravitational ways you visited back to yourself in the past gave you a hint laughter sc well but kt 
no yeah so yes so then you immediately do worry about paradoxes and so what i did again with 
and colleagues and so we asked ourselves suppose you do have a wormhole you did turn it into a 
machine successfully it selfdestruct in the process then how do you deal with these paradoxes how does nature deal 
these and so what we did was well a colleague of mine a dear colleague of mine and yours 
polchinski who just passed away sadly fairly recently sc right kt a really great theoretical physicist he had been 
student of mine years ago decades ago and joe sent me an email i think it was an email 
it was a letter in those days this is the sc about the dawn of the early email days 
kt and he said a little thought experiment you send a billiard ball into a one wormhole mouth and 
comes back out of the other mouth before it went down and it hits itself and prevents itself from 
in how do you solve that so we called this so together with some students i worked out what 
nature say about paradox we found that there are multiple ways that nature can get out of it sc 
kt the billiard ball goes in it gets hit a very gentle blow by itself on its way in 
it goes in it comes out on a slightly different trajectory than it was supposed to and hits itself 
a very general blow laughter kt so everything is all right but there are a number of general ways 
can do these gentle blows and so you wind up with more than one solution the laws of physics 
of just one solution where you thought there were none and you thought no way no answer to what 
to the billiard ball when it goes in there got a paradox first you say the billiard ball goes 
it comes back out it hits itself and prevents it from itself from going in the trajectory and then 
find a trajectory where modified itself and then you find another one and then another one and in the 
of classical physics there had not ought to be multiple solutions when you post initial conditions there should not 
multiple answers and so then you go to quantum physics and you ask what does quantum physics say so 
becomes a very interesting game eventually trying to figure out how does nature get out of this and this 
much easier to deal with this with billiard balls than with human beings who go back in time and 
to kill their grandparents sc the more common thing but joe is a good physicist honed in on a 
physics problem so interesting because on basic features of sort of logical consistency we would not want to have 
true paradox or two incompatible things happen and you are saying that it seems that at least at the 
level what nature gives up on is not logical consistency but predictability more than one possible way out kt 
but then we pay attention to the fact that the world is really fundamentally quantum at the bottom and 
where you have these multiple solutions classically you go in and analyze them quantum mechanically and what you and 
would call it a wkb approximate laughter kt this getting jargon sc we will footnote that okay a good 
scheme we can use kt and so you see that the quantum physics probably has a solution to get 
this and probably one unique solution so my bottom line with this and my problem is that i was 
deep into this and felt like i was making some progress in understanding how you would deal with paradoxes 
ligo got funded laughter kt and i said i spend my rest of my career now working hard on 
gravitational waves a success or do i think about time travel with sc i love time travel but you 
the right choice laughter but the way you mention quantum mechanics there just because i know probably some people 
a little bit about the idea of branching the universe off because you have a time machine and creating 
new timeline and not what talking about is that right kt no not at all what talking about sc 
using quantum mechanics to find the one consistent most probable trajectory that would actually happen kt and so what 
really want to do is ask how do you formulate quantum mechanics in the presence of a time machine 
in fact there is a way to do it and using a formulation of quantum mechanics due to our 
friend richard feynman but a generalization of ideas is due to his colleague murray gellmann and jim hartland so 
tools are sc very caltechy fell about it kt very caltechy feel right well with hartland at caltech and 
barbara but the tools are there to do it sc jim a grad student at caltech i mean back 
the day kt he was murray grad student sc yeah alright kt and john was an undergraduate and post 
but that anyway you can formulate quantum mechanics in a way that handles all this in the presence of 
we call in presence with time machine but for me the beautiful thing about this is that once done 
you discover that information gets lost sc right physicists like this kt and physicists like that sc some physicists 
this kt some physicists like this but i think quite wonderful but anyway and so then you get caught 
in the socalled information loss paradox and a view of this that i have iconoclastic that differs from that 
the majority of physicists sc but a good little lesson about how you were fooling around in some sense 
you trying to build a time machine you were inspired by a question from carl sagan but it leads 
to some maybe interesting insights into questions people really care about yeah kt precisely since i came to appreciate 
in areas where dealing with physics beyond where we can actually do experiments today someday we will but not 
thought experiments like these simple thought experiments like what happens to billiard balls if they collide through a worm 
that has a time machine built into it simple thought experiments can sometimes dig pretty deeply into the laws 
nature sc and nevertheless i remember a footnote or the acknowledgements in one of your papers saying that the 
science foundation pay you to work on this anymore laughter kt that was a half tongue in cheek remark 
half so the story is that i was working on this in parallel with the gearing up to build 
and we had our major funding for ligo in the end billion for ligo coming from the national science 
and i had a conversation about this research with richard isaacson the superb program director for our field at 
a person who i regard ray liston i regard as really our collaborator in washington who really made this 
anyway so isaacson said to me want to screw things up for ligo if some congressman comes in and 
hacking at you for working on time machines and maybe you can find funding elsewhere for that work just 
keep yourself safe from being attacked by sc it sounds like a good advice kt it was a very 
advice but i also tweeted back at richard isaacson and put in this acknowledgements this work was not supported 
the national science it sc i did not know that kt instead it was supported by the richard chace 
research fund at caltech sc tolman tolman richard chace tolman kt tolman it was the tolman funds sc right 
kt wait a minute sequential point it this was in the so i became the feynman professor sc yeah 
know kt i think it was feynman funds actually sc okay that could be alright kt i think it 
feynman funds sc but another spinoff of this fortuitous conversation you have with carl sagan was that you got 
in the phenomenon of hollywood making science fiction movies right kt yeah sc and is it exactly right or 
you can correct me like you were not perfectly happy with how the movie version of contact turned out 
yeah right so george miller was the original director of contact and he was working very hard to perfect 
tailend of the movie involving wormholes and the ultimate denouement at the end of the movie and he got 
by the studio for taking too long sc hollywood yep kt and so they brought in zemeckis with an 
finish things off you diddle any longer with the screenplay you finish things off we wanna get into and 
he did and basically all the efforts that were being put into really perfecting the last part of the 
went down the tubes so i was disappointed in that sc so did that inspire you to say do 
kt no laughter no no i never had any intention to do that but yeah it was always in 
back of my mind but i got into this simply because lynda obst who had been partner in hollywood 
contact a movie producer a great movie producer she called me up one day in two thousand four and 
you like to brainstorm with me for a science fiction sc okay and what led to interstellar kt what 
to interstellar but i had no plan to do that sc so we we have hollywood people on the 
so we need to rehearse the entire process but how do you go from brainstorming to seeing your name 
there as an executive producer kt oh that happens by having a very good attorney laughter sc an important 
for the young hollywood strivers out there yes absolutely kt so i lynda said to once we had brainstormed 
she had brought on a studio which bought an option to make the movie from the treatment that she 
i had created through brainstorming the treatment is just a description of a story and in our case with 
embedded in the story so she brought in a studio and she said have to negotiate with the studio 
do it yourself you have to have an sc okay kt so with the help of a caltech president 
went to a member the board of trustees who was well connected in hollywood i got a great attorney 
safran sc good to know people in high places kt yeah and ken negotiated and got me an executive 
credit off the bat based on the brainstorming that we had done initially and on the expectation that i 
stick with the project all the way through and would be the lead science advisor and realize the vision 
lynda and i had formulated of a film with science embedded deeply into it from the outset sc and 
what was the first step was it getting the director or the screenwriter kt well so lynda brought well 
story is that lynda brought on steven spielberg to direct it and the two of them were both with 
at the time and so then they brought on paramount steven then was the director through the early creative 
when making the movie the early creative phase lasted for a few years they brought on jonathan nolan or 
as known to his friends to write the screenplay jonah had written a couple of screenplays previously with his 
christopher nolan but that was the extent of his experience in hollywood since then he has created person of 
sc westworld kt and westworld sc yeah doing okay laughter kt doing okay yeah and westworld with his wife 
joy and but he was really pretty green and young at the time but superb and wonderful to work 
so he went through three drafts of the screenplay and then steven always carries more movies in the creative 
than he can possibly make and he crunch time came and he was going to make lincoln sc okay 
or he was going to sc interstellar kt interstellar and i know he may have had other choices as 
but he did make the choice to make lincoln sc he certainly has over a dozen movies in development 
one time right kt so that was his choice and christopher nolan being brother had said to lynda before 
dropped out he had said steven drops out i would be interested in considering making this sc pretty good 
possibility just to have in your knowledge kt and so when steven dropped out then lynda and paramount started 
try to negotiate with chris chris said i negotiate until after my next movie comes out and has been 
for maybe six months so then sc he is the opposite right he does one thing at a time 
he is the opposite he does one thing at a time he even make a decision about the next 
gonna do until the previous movie has been out for a few months he sees how been done gone 
all of the publicity on it and so forth and then he starts thinking seriously about what like doing 
and so we waited for two and a half years while he did batman the dark knight rises and 
a few months after that came out he negotiated seriously with paramount by then lynda had had a divorce 
paramount as had steven laughter kt and chris was not about ready to work with paramount so chris said 
work with warner and sc and none of your physics education had prepared you for any of this kt 
but fortunately i had a great attorney sc you had a great attorney yeah kt and a great partner 
lynda sc right somebody knew the ropes yeah kt lynda is superb she knows the ropes and ken knows 
ropes so i just sat back and waited and got briefed by phone and email from time to time 
so anyway it was obvious that chris was the person who should make this movie obvious to everybody and 
paramount negotiated with warner brothers that warner brothers would have the rights all the foreign rights for this movie 
would have the domestic us rights and they would do it jointly but the production would be in the 
of warner brothers because where chris works sc close to his home okay and laughter kt and then as 
say this is not part of my training so i watched this all sc a wonderful education right kt 
real education yeah sc and speaking of education you figured out you had some good science projects coming out 
the attempts to get the science right in the movie kt yeah yeah and so yeah so i very 
enjoyed working well i enjoyed brainstorming with the nolan brothers i enjoyed my interaction with the actors and particularly 
the computer graphics team at double negative limited london led by paul franklin who was one of the founders 
leaders of double negative and together then at christopher request enthusiastic request which i was expecting he wanted everything 
involve visualizations of black holes and wormholes and astrophysical objects to be done as accurately as possible through computer 
and solving the equational propagation of light from the source of the light through the environment to an imax 
through the optics of the imax camera with all of the vagaries of the optics of the imax camera 
the film at the end and so that was how it was done and i provided the equations for 
propagation of the light to oliver james who was the chief scientist at double negative and he programmed the 
and the artist there created the images of the sources of the light and it all came together quite 
sc and i remember if i remember correctly you saying that not all science in the movie might be 
but absolutely compatible with what we currently know about the laws of physics kt not everything almost everything sc 
everything kt so the agreement between christopher nolan and me from the outset was i told him i wanted 
to be compatible with the laws of nature and he said enthusiastic to do that as long as it 
in the way of making a great sc which is fair kt i think fair sc yeah absolutely kt 
he was afraid how i would be playing the role of science police sc right kt and i was 
he respect the science and within a few hours of brainstorming together it became obvious that we were on 
same wavelength that we could work together as beautifully as i had worked with his brother on the screenplay 
it became a marvelous collaboration there did come one point when we had these wonderful images of the wormhole 
of the spacecraft traveling around the wormhole and then they had to make the commuter graphics for the trip 
the wormhole and i got a telephone call from christopher nolan and he said would you come over to 
house got a sc okay kt i went over and he said tried various sizes and shapes of wormholes 
is what the trip to the wormhole looks like with this shape and size and what it looks like 
another one none of them are very exciting all pretty dull sc because they would be actually right kt 
would be so he said do i i said use creative and the one place where there was substantial 
for what the things would really be like everywhere else there were a number of other places with little 
if you wanna know all of the places that i was aware of at the time the movie came 
there were a few i missed where there were little glitches with regard to the laws of physics you 
to my book science of first you buy the book the science of interstellar sc first buy the book 
for christmas present too yeah laughter kt anyway you go to the subject index but you look up a 
in the subject index you look up christopher nolan and then under christopher nolan in the subject index see 
of the compromises that he made with the science in order to make a great movie sc your conscience 
clean though you kt with most books that written over my career there are there little gems like this 
in them sc yeah a good thing to do kt and you may find them if clever in the 
or you may be told sc the authors have to keep themselves entertained as well as everybody else so 
you have another movie in the plan kt i do so stephen hawking and lynda obst and i wrote 
treatment for a followon movie several years ago before stephen passed away and very enthusiastic about the movie again 
science fiction movie again with science real science built into it well so with this movie then we went 
the same process lynda identified the studio we sold an option well she and sc and your lawyer kt 
lawyer ken safran and his team sold an option to make the movie from our treatment to a studio 
studio hired the screenwriter that we wanted they had an offer out to the director we want and it 
go forward but not allowed to say anything on that sc no kt and probably more than allowed to 
sc not even asking well probably that much is on imdb already right so much goes out now so 
the process kt enjoyed the process very much very much and i should say with interstellar the nolan brothers 
the story so much it and my story at all we in the way things work in hollywood if 
the story for a movie then you go and you ask the screen writers guild that you want a 
for we even ask for a credit for a because they had changed the story in very positive ways 
about the changes they had made so this wound up as the movie but with the science that came 
lynda and me and then additional science from the brain storming with the nolan brothers in this second movie 
far followed pretty close to the story that we began with in the treatment sc very exciting kt so 
stephen and i and lynda will get the credit for see sc well kip thorne i think that one 
everyone who has listened to the podcast will be able to say is been very laughter had a great 
had great fun had great fun sc yeah and i love the variety of it we even get into 
various books that written but great science a little bit of fun living here in la been a great 
thanks so much being on podcast kt thank you music super if time is emergent does talking about time 
even make sense thanks so much is inspiring and wonderful loved seems to be rather sf than just s 
is why i subscribe and a little shocked that everyone is afraid to ask a nobel laureate a few 
i have some naive questions because i do not know a lot about ligo or multimessenger astronomy i understand 
ligo uses coupled pendulums to reduce the noise created by random vibrations my favorite physics demonstration of this vibration 
which is itself a monumental engineering achievement is here i also understand that the atoms in the mirror are 
vibrating due to heat is it possible to use a similar coupled pendulum system with long polymer chains linked 
by heavier elements like lead with a single conductingreflecting atom of gold or silver at the end can laser 
also be used to dampen motion for the other degrees of freedom if black holes merge and become larger 
time then how many black hole mergers did it take to create sagittarius a if black holes drift towards 
center of a globular cluster then how long would it take for a cloud the size of the milky 
to flatten into its spiral shape around a larger black hole is the gas around a galaxy more likely 
accumulate closer to the edge of a galaxy if doubling the galactic radius increases the matter absorption cross section 
a factor of four do the spacetime storms of black holes obey the hairy ball theorem how do spacetime 
impact the formation and evolution of quasars if black holes rotate clockwise and anticlockwise at their opposite pole then 
that match the initial direction and magnitude of their angular momentum if black holes have a moment of inertia 
is it impossible for them to travel faster than the speed of light through space even if space moves 
than the speed of light inside of the black event horizon why was the calculated mass of a black 
off by a factor of two can ligo be used to check if g the gravitational coupling constant is 
same everywhere in the universe if dr who is an alien that evolved millions of light years away then 
the dr manipulate history without creating a grandfather paradox a ball colliding with its past self and preventing it 
entering a wormhole assumes that causality is still valid if it is possible to travel faster than light and 
quantum physics is nonlocal then is causality still a safe assumption if time is symmetric then does that mean 
the entropy inside the wormhole cannot increase and where does the extra entropy go and in which direction do 
have any evidence of time travel are there any other tricks to get the nsf to fund time travel 
i wonder what sean would have to say about this great podcast i was left with a question about 
and the collisions it can detect the first detected event is believed to have been the result of the 
of two black holes sean asked whether we could expect mergers of supermassive black holes like those found at 
centers of galaxies and if ligo would be able to detect such an event if it happened my naive 
was that the bigger the smash the easier the detection so i was surprised when thorne said that such 
collision was well beyond range the explanation that the wavelengths generated would be way too long made some sense 
we frame this as collisions or mergers of two black holes each with the mass of m suns i 
that there are values of m that are too small for ligo to detect a collision and values of 
that are in some sense too large supermassive can anyone give a sense of what the sweet spot is 
to be i can still here the utah in his voice what a great podcast thanks sean fabulous thanks 
been looking for answers about detection of mergers of smbhs and here it is in your podcast not the 
i wanted though comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers science society philosophy
