and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and several years ago i watched a documentary about 
called examined life there that many documentaries about philosophers and it was just a very enjoyable thoughtprovoking kind of 
you had these philosophers out there in the world they just behind their desks in their offices or lecturing 
a hallway they were out there in cars on the streets doing things and then talking about the relationship 
philosophy and practice and the real world so i was interested to find out that the documentarian who made 
film astra taylor has recently been working on the idea of democracy she has both another documentary that just 
out called what is democracy and she has a new book that has just come out called democracy may 
exist but miss it when gone sc i think almost exactly right you know as soon as you say 
blah blah so many people say live in a either live in a or they try to say we 
have the voice that we should to truly make it a and so forth and so astra is saying 
but still good things about democracy that we should think about try to make them better rather than just 
that it be so she goes all the way back to ancient greece plato and aristotle our founding philosophers 
notoriously against democracy they really like the idea but athens was definitely the touchstone for the flowering of democracy 
in the western world at least and rome as those of you who listen to mindscape know from my 
with ed watts rome was more of a republic than a democracy and interesting to compare those and interesting 
move forward to the present day where we have technology and we live in these huge societies where the 
between the individual voters and what their governments do grows increasingly tenuous sc so democracy is on the one 
very very important to us on the other hand taken for granted a little bit and we should promote 
i think but also we need to keep it on its toes we need to make sure that really 
what it is there to do good questions to ask about whether democracy is the right thing to do 
a philosophical intellectual viewpoint we should always be probing whether on the right track so i think that democracy 
a fantastically important part of our world yet something we actually devote enough brain cells to really thinking about 
a deep way and i think this conversation helps us do that in a way that is also very 
sc reminders of course this is a podcast so welcome to go onto itunes and elsewhere and leave reviews 
it we also have a patreon account where you can support mindscape we have ads coming up but the 
supporters will certainly still get benefits for example you get adfree versions of the podcast if you support on 
and also we get the monthly ask me anythings where you can ask me any question and i will 
to answer it in a special podcast just for patreon supporters so still some motivation to go there with 
i think this is a wonderful conversation that is both philosophically provocative and very very relevant to how we 
in the world today so go music sc astra taylor thanks so much for coming on the mindscape podcast 
taylor well thanks for having me sc so i am familiar with some of your films back in the 
zizek and the examined life and these were about philosophical topics pretty straightforwardly right and here you are with 
new book out and also a new documentary about democracy so why you tell us a little about your 
from slightly more abstract ivory tower philosophizing to a little bit more down in the political mess kind of 
and activism at yeah it it seems like they might be unrelated but to me they really are i 
always been someone who wanted to marry theory and practice so i could never quite become a fulltime philosopher 
chuckle could only be a scholar because i always wanted to experiment with my ideas and especially if they 
to ethics and politics and the question that old socratic question of how should we live well you decide 
on your own you really figure that out definitively on your own and so then the question for me 
been okay well how do i build this kind of life where i get to engage with questions philosophical 
theoretical questions have a kind of life of the mind and also the life of a person trying to 
those principles in some ways so i do that through organizing and i do that through writing and i 
that through filmmaking so those zizek came out in so i was examined life came out in and those 
tagline of examined life was philosophy is in the streets sc right at so what i wanted to do 
that was to show the way these abstract ideas are actually all around us built into our environment in 
space we inhabit and to treat ideas with a bit of a reverence and playfulness so i have all 
philosophers sort of traveling through different places and even rowing a boat or chuckle walking through a garbage dump 
to also you know in a way express my own enthusiasm for philosophy and to share it with people 
to share it in a way that intimidate them chuckle i hope sc right yeah at i wanted to 
it fun and engaging but then i sort of felt after examined life came out like well this i 
of being a filmmaker you know again i want to bring these i wanted to kind of go the 
step which for me was actually trying to get more involved in politics and organizing so so when you 
at it that way then what is democracy which is the name of the documentary film and the companion 
democracy may not exist but miss it when gone kind actually a very clear kind of next step and 
will say this about it democracy in my mind as i understand it and i say this in the 
demands philosophy democracy is intellectually hard a quote from danielle allen a classicist and who i interviewed and hard 
at the center of democracy is an abstraction the people right sc right at the people just exist like 
fact out there in the world that we can point to and so already you have this abstraction and 
do you have an abstraction deciding things and making ethical decisions and governing itself so philosophy is sort of 
and parcel of democratic life and we hint at this in our media when we talk about deliberation or 
or even this whole conversation happening now about facts the truth but i think so democracy is theory in 
always like we have to reflect and act and reflect and act and so the film is an attempt 
the book are both attempts to just sort of bring that philosophical dimension into focus and my feeling is 
can help us at this moment of political crisis but other people might not agree democracy sc well i 
yeah exactly i think that because most of us in this country grew up in a democracy we tend 
forget or at least underestimate how philosophically radical this idea is and the idea that just everybody has a 
or supposedly has a voice in how the society is run certainly comes along with a whole bunch of 
about who deserves to have power and things like that so philosophy should be part of that it makes 
to me at yeah and but interesting so the both of the projects go back to the founding text 
the western philosophical tradition republic and the founding text of western philosophy and interesting antidemocracy it is written at 
moment when athenian democracy is in decline and plato is he is issuing a very powerful critique of democracy 
a nutshell and he basically says democracy marginalizes the wise his definition of a philosopher was someone who loves 
and the virtuous and he had reason to think that because the democracy put his mentor socrates to death 
said you can either be exiled or you can drink the and he was too proud and he drank 
hemlock at so always been this this concern a concern ancient that well the people philosophical they wise and 
i think you see this in my work again and again where saying we have to create a philosophical 
is also about democratizing not just access to knowledge or information or facts but of confidence that one can 
in a certain kind of conversation and precisely because that abstract reflection is demanded by the political system that 
say we have we say we aspire to so we better do it at no other way no way 
it you have democracy and not aspire to have a philosophical public because democracy has there is no barrier 
entry right it be based on the color of your skin how much money is in your bank account 
what school you went to like we can all be part of sc for everybody right well preaching to 
converted here at landscape central this is part of what trying to do with the podcast is talk to 
about big ideas in a way that is made possible by this new medium so i really do want 
get mostly into democracy but i have to ask sort of a strategic question about writing books versus making 
right how do you visualize those two very separate but related activities most people would do one or the 
but you try to get both going at yeah and then i want to ask you a question because 
i always like to do sc sure at so i mean to me i think medium agnostic and medium 
we have all these different mediums and not a marshall mcluhan the medium is the message and so each 
but there is some truth to that different mediums have different affordances different capacities they conjure different affects sc 
and different audiences right at and different audiences right so for me it and i see organizing as a 
so when you are building an institution a medium through which human beings interact and perceive the world and 
it just sort of depends on what has captured my attention film is more akin to a podcast in 
sense that direct it has an emotional quality because my films are mostly made up of interviews with people 
so the words that literally speaking but then all of their expressive aspects and whether you empathize with them 
you like them whether charismatic or not sc i get a lot of comments on the podcast about the 
that audio only and sympathetic to this it really does matter to see people talk but so far i 
the technological capabilities of that but maybe sometime in the future that will happen at well funny i often 
podcasts are great because you have to see someone so like what if the ugly or what if raining 
sc right yes at or brushing their nose in an awkward way then all that matters is said but 
at film my film is an hour and fortyfive minutes or so but if you transcribed it it make 
sense because there are these leaps that film allows and also it be very long it would be like 
academic book chapter or something like that so the film allows for me to give space to other people 
honor them to be interested in them to actually kind of express to the audience my own curiosity about 
people which i think is important which is kind of what doing on this podcast saying i might be 
amazing physicist but still curious about people i still want to ask sc very much right at and i 
asking questions and having that curiosity almost as interested in having that be part of my propaganda we should 
curious about others as the more traditional political takeaways of the film and in a book you get to 
at length you get to have footnotes all of these things all of these details that would just weigh 
movie down sc sure at you stop and say check this page of this obscure text machiavelli or madison 
marx or so where i get to be more didactic i also get to say i get to express 
point of view more so the mediums have different depending on what it is trying to communicate when i 
speak at colleges and young people come up to me and say really want to be a always slightly 
because to me like just a shell or a vessel what is it you want to sc yeah a 
point right at lots of terrible books in the world lots of terrible movies to me the message the 
the thing that you want to share with other humans sc yeah because i think that at heart your 
is not a filmmaker an intellectualactivist right at yes sc i remember a science consultant sometimes for movies and 
i got to meet ridley scott who was thinking of making a movie of the forever war and i 
it has happened maybe it will never happen so based on a novel already so some plot but there 
no screenplay at the time when we met with him but he clearly in his mind had certain scenes 
perfectly mapped out visually and it was very clear from talking to him that what he was about making 
wonderful visual moments and then the plot okay figure that out what happens in the movie comes i think 
okay but a very different thing than someone who is just about the message or the substance and then 
different media in which to express it at yeah i think really different and very charmed and interested in 
who are visual first or say had this image of a girl walking through a field of a filmmaker 
literally said that and i was like was beautiful sc yeah it can work at a beautiful thing to 
to have other art forms but again not me i was interested in you because i and i write 
this a little bit in the chapter on education in the book but there are kinds of expertise that 
a cliche of a person with knowledge being this theoretical physicist sc credentialed and so forth yes at right 
and so but yet still open to this idea of democracy as an intellectual pursuit that needs to include 
just curious if that just is that just something that is almost like an instinctual sense of trust of 
people sc well yeah this is definitely something that i want to talk about so talk about it at 
sc democracy one of the radical parts of it is the idea that everyone not only has a voice 
is in some sense ideally equal right one person one vote of course there are distortions to that from 
and money and so forth but the ideal and clearly a worry that some people really deserve as much 
a voice if sort these days we would call it technocratic if you think a right answer to what 
should do at all times it the case that the smart people are more likely to find the right 
sc but i always it was never very hard to me i just thought it that was the wrong 
of thinking about how a government works and the purpose of democracy the purpose is to make sure interests 
represented right sc i feel bad because very middleoftheroad about these things i like the idea of a representative 
in which people vote and they express their interest by doing that and then their representatives gain expertise in 
ways and implement the policies the best way possible it seems very bourgeois and so forth i think that 
that system works very well the right thing to do and so i think that the right place for 
is at the level where already recommended sorry already elected our representatives and those people ideally will go to 
experts to find out going on at yeah not unsympathetic i think i say something in the book like 
to be involved in every right chuckle at that expertise is an i think when that becomes abstracted to 
level of like well just let technocrats govern or the experts then it becomes more of a problem sc 
oh no absolutely at because they become a selfserving group and maybe no accountability so funny i describe myself 
middle of the road but always trying to find the complexities or find the balance in things or and 
think expertise is really interesting something undemocratic about it sc absolutely at not everybody can be an expert at 
and yet we desperately need it in a society complicated as ours sc well i think a huge worry 
think that one of the sets of people who reject democracy implicitly or explicitly are people or the masters 
the universe who think that they know best and think that basically they should have the voice and in 
sense i had a podcast interview with yascha mounk about liberal democracy and how failing and his point was 
word liberal is not just there to make it a longer phrase it really means something it means a 
set of protections for people and populist movements can be very democratic as long as they define democratic in 
right way and his theory is that a lot of the attraction to populist movements is that democracy is 
to not be working in places like europe where the european union has put so much power into technocratic 
so that the person on the street thinks nothing that i do has any impact on what the government 
and i think not an expert in it i whether true or not but i do agree it would 
bad if that were the right case at well to bring it back to the united states there does 
to be quite a bit of evidence that regular people actually have any say over the policies so there 
the famous study that became known as the oligarchy study but i recall the actual name sc what is 
not familiar with the oligarchy study at so the political scientists were gilens and page it i think this 
maybe i feel like time is speeding up i remember when things came up sc i can explain that 
physics at but essentially they crunched the numbers and they said citizens have virtually no impact over big donors 
again these are things people know in their guts even if they read the social science research and i 
part of the frustration yascha mounk is an interesting example i read his book and i was very surprised 
see my name mentioned as a populist sc what at and i had written yeah i had written a 
i mean sorry i had written an article where i said hey part of the and it was for 
new republic which is a bastion of liberalism actually but i said the point of it was basically that 
the wake of the election dawn so a big antidemocratic urge coming from elites actually right the sense that 
people had made a terrible mistake there was actually this resurgence of interest in republic maybe democracy does always 
into tyranny and i understand why that was happening but my sense was my point was that the problem 
in my view that we democratized enough that still work to be done not name democracy as the problem 
over what we mean by democracy and democratization look at the concentration of wealth and power try to look 
the sources of frustrations and address those at and so i think i come at it from a different 
because i whereas some people are very worried right now about a sort of populist threat and sort of 
question almost of the tyranny of the majority right the people and their unruly passions so again the plato 
more concerned about the points of minority veto power in our political system right now in the way that 
desires are actually being thwarted because if you look for example there is rising xenophobia horrible things happening right 
at the border and there are very scary scary trends not just in the us but in europe and 
at and yet polls show that actually americans have more positive views of immigration than had since americans want 
control americans want all sorts of progressive forwardlooking things and blocked because of again these veto points structures of 
power the supreme going to be worse on this moving forward the senate is also a minoritarian sort of 
in the sense that less populous states have disproportionate power the electoral college obviously is what really gave us 
trump as the president so where always trying to temper this condemnation of the people and say hold on 
are the structures that are actually blocking the more progressive sc well interesting so i think that what i 
from talking to yascha was the idea that populism its selfconception is very democratic but always at the cost 
shrinking the circle of the people who actually count as the ones who get to vote right so excluding 
and so forth or minorities at yeah interesting all definitions are unsettled and so for me i also again 
go back to the question of democracy so what we i always joke because people bring up issues of 
and liberalism in the q and as for my film especially and always like yes i can my next 
more unmarketable film will be what is chuckle at to begin with the titular question of my film what 
democracy and i like to go back to the ancient greek roots of the word and i think very 
to be clear that the greeks give us the practice of democracy or of people engaging and trying to 
power over their own lives but they gave us this word and i think a really great word and 
demos the people have kratos power or rule hold power grasp power meant to sort of hold on to 
and so this question of who the people are is constitutive of democracy itself not a populist aberration to 
fighting over how we define this something that we have to kind of face head on sc a question 
is begged by the idea of democracy right who are the people who have this will at just part 
our struggle and so it is true that this you can call it small p populist tendency to say 
do a kind of us or them and exclude immigrants and foreigners but then as i said also just 
problem of democracy itself how do we define the demos how do we define the polity how do we 
the and make that accountable so i think this is a problem that we have to face and it 
really a really thorny not just philosophical issue because lives are at stake but shown that demos can radically 
and it can radically contract and i think the point is to recognize actually how things are today are 
set in stone and what we have to always remember to have to keep an imaginative flame alive sc 
you do democracy well this question of who counts right who is in the demos a person you just 
everybody right because no democracy ever that has given people the right to vote the moment born for example 
exclude children historically excluded women and various groups i had an interesting podcast interview with ed watts the historian 
the decline of the roman republic it was actually replaced by an empire but it succeeded very well for 
hundred years and part of its success was whenever rome would conquer another country they would very quickly give 
the right to vote in roman elections and that seems a little weird to us today but it worked 
well for them at the time it just is a reminder no clearly right and wrong way to draw 
lines at well interesting because the empires have often done that right the method the roman a great example 
just like fine now a citizen right now you are being assimilated essentially by and democracies do have an 
tendency towards the opposite which is to exclude and so to contrast rome with greece greece athens was extremely 
because you had to have two citizen parents at a certain point they said oh no you used to 
have to have the one citizen parent then they made it that the mother also had to be a 
so made that bloodline even more constrained and if you look i talk about this in the book in 
chapter on inclusion and exclusion that for example canada so canadian but i grew up in the american south 
when canada was part of the british empire or that constellation it was more open to immigrants and then 
it separated itself and had control of its citizenship laws it started to become more exclusive so some really 
more canadianness at yeah some and then they were like but hold on what is canadianness and so in 
process of even inventing what it meant to be canadian they started to close the door to people from 
parts of the world so this is definitely one of least appealing features my point i think what makes 
really hard is that right now difficult just given the state of the world to imagine forms of constructing 
demos or a people that really negative because living in a moment where the exclusions are founded on really 
histories so histories of racism histories of colonization immigration law is designed to exploit labor forces right so then 
really in a position where we can ask well hold on when is setting the boundary of a community 
ethical when do people need to be involved in a decision or sc you mean because when on the 
hand we have to do that but on the other hand hard to separate the fact that been really 
about these things going in the past at so yeah right now exclusions are predicated on terrible things like 
race the arbitrary fact of where you were born and they were based on gender and sexuality exclusion does 
have a pretty history and sc you remind us that switzerland only gave women the vote in one thousand 
hundred seventyone or something like that at yeah right and this is all really really recent so i think 
thing is under and yet i agree we imagine democracy including ten billion people because that would be incoherent 
i think but there has we have to wrestle with this fact that at a certain point yeah you 
have to have you do have to have boundaries and i think for me the solution is that we 
to create a more equal world where in a world that is so terribly unequal where the thing that 
the quality of your life your life expectancy is not what a hard worker you are or how smart 
are but just basically where you were born sc where you were born yeah at right and your passport 
so in a world like that exclusion is a matter of life or death in a more equal world 
would be a very very different calculus and the fact is in a more equal world a lot less 
would want to move from where they are sc one likes to think at and abandon their community sc 
so one of the issues i wanted to ask about was the relationship of democracy which put aside the 
that democracy is not a good idea okay there are people who think that but agree that democracy is 
but lots of things that are good equality and liberty and justice and economic freedom healthcare whatever how do 
you include all those good things in a definition of democracy or do we try to slice it so 
we can consider all these virtues separately at i have a hard and fast answer to that i think 
something that every generation will have to reassess because we have i think we have shifting expectations and shifting 
so i think democracy does demand by its definition by its minimal definition of the people ruling a baseline 
equality of political equality sc political equality right at yeah and i think that you cannot have political equality 
conditions of intense economic inequality sc yeah i think a reasonable claim but one that you have to work 
establish it and really convince people yeah at and still controversial to a lot of very powerful people and 
some less powerful people who aspire to having that kind of idea what is the phrase like we all 
going to be millionaires one day so we hold political ideals for those incredibly fabulously wealth future selves so 
think there is this i think there are some minimum requirements should we separate out these other values from 
i think we have to decide is we have to decide what are the values that we are oriented 
as a people so yeah maybe separate but then they become part of the democratic project like it becomes 
of implicit that well democracy well in the phrase of the constitution the pursuit of happiness rather have it 
just wellbeing or something like that sc flourishing yeah at but collective flourishing or something like that so very 
to just separate the ends from the means the goal from the process and yet i do think that 
again they always those values always have to be assessed and reassessed sc yeah this is at and we 
aspire to things we aspire to things obviously that one hundred years ago people would have just been like 
hell are you people aiming at or who are you people a lot of you people are not supposed 
be in the chuckle sc and a hundred years from now what will that discussion look like about us 
exactly the kind of thing i like to think and you spend your life in science physics universe time 
sometimes i want to say even in our more mundane conception of time but hopefully a hundred years from 
there will be new assumptions and new aspirations that make us look backwards and part of sc i hope 
we like to think progress right at yeah and part of why i like the word democracy in its 
because who the people are is open for debate and how they rule is also open to contestation and 
so i like that this concept that we have this word we can hold on to but we can 
really radically reinvent it sc yeah this was impressed on me actually believe it not when i took a 
in grad school with john rawls the political philosopher and at oh wow never a titan sc he was 
he was an amazing guy and actually i always find it funny because he loved cosmology and physics so 
really never got to talk to him about philosophy he always wanted to talk about cosmology whenever we chatted 
he had his motto was as and ordering a society on the basis of fairness to everyone and happily 
this always true for our great thinkers but he lived by what he preached and he was the fairest 
i ever ever met and one of his things was he had an ongoing challenge if you can find 
logical flaw in his principles of justice then he gives you one hundred dollars or something like that and 
one ever did it right sc he listened if you had a proposal but one of the things was 
course these principles are having to do with allow inequality unless it benefits even the least off in society 
would come up with something what if there was an epidemic and everyone was dying and you had to 
something like but he was very clear that he meant his principles to apply to a wellordered functioning healthy 
right and that was all a precondition for making any of this happen and i think that even if 
a rawlsian an underappreciated aspect of democracy that if not requires then at least suggests that everyone should have 
minimal both economic and political resources at i think it does because you again if democracy is people engaging 
ruling themselves if you well if you have the minimum subsistence not just to survive but also so that 
be terribly coerced right then you engage in the processes democracy requires but this is we take this as 
sense but at different moments in history people looked at this in different ways so for the ancient greeks 
was a contempt of labor they associated leisure with democracy with that freedom that space to govern in fact 
just learned that the roots of the word school was actually also had to do with free time they 
that time to engage in the learning to engage in the more elevated modes of life which included being 
to go to the assembly and stuff like that at and so there was a whole enslaved laboring class 
the united states was is a democracy that was founded on unfreedom on slavery and there was also a 
that working people just were subject to coercion not necessarily like freehold farmers who had their own land why 
yeoman farmer was this ideal but people in the factories or slaves so there was this sense that laboring 
have what it takes to cover themselves sc yeah you stand up and you had this wonderful scene in 
film where interviewing these school kids in miami i think it was and you ask you bring up the 
or the prospect that they could have a voice in how the school was run and they point out 
when they try to ask for things their privileges can be taken away right their vending machines can be 
away and this actually happens and part of that of course a surface of saying like this is why 
get to participate in but then you think about it and go like wait a minute maybe the kid 
this parable like maybe all of us are subject to having our privileges taken away in some way at 
really like that and happy how you interpret it how i see it too i think the and interesting 
film and the book are companions but not like the book is a transcript of the film and yet 
kids live in both mediums they got to be in the movie and the book and important because when 
about the problem facing our society right now one solution we tend to hold on to and we tend 
focus education like democracy needs and true it does but then the question is well education to what end 
are what are the lessons people are being taught about democracy and so by going to this public school 
inner city miami and so i spoke with kids who like middle school age so maybe eleven through thirteen 
at and what you see is that they are being taught lessons about democracy but very dispiriting ones a 
of hidden curriculum right not hidden to them i guess because gleaning its messages but basically being taught to 
and bear it sc their place in the world yeah at being taught their place in the world so 
the thing about the vending machine comes up i ask them what they would change about their school and 
say well what really like is for their food to be hot it taste good but at least it 
be warmed up and then the administrators come down on them sc just asking you so much just unbelievable 
would be so greedy chuckle at just such a reasonable demand that they have right they just want their 
to be hot and then the vending machine thing comes up because this one and at first you think 
right should kids be eating junk food at their but then what you realize is saying the kids have 
at home their only chance to eat and so these kids are very astute so young very astute and 
i was struck by is that they blame their teachers for their problems they have an analysis of the 
structure so they understand the teachers are controlled by administrators who are controlled by the state who at so 
see the adults as powerless so this idea that we are the children in the parable because the children 
saying know the adults are powerless and so i wanted that scene to be in the film so that 
would have to ask well what kind of and in the book able to go more deeply into the 
for universal public education where that idea even emerged so breaking with the ancient greeks breaking with the founding 
and saying no we just have workers who get time who get time to feed their minds and to 
full and in the book i show that working class movements have always been at the cutting edge for 
demand for not just skills training but for education to be a whole thinking participant in public life and 
of giving the people who usually get credit the credit i think they deserve looking back historically sc and 
wonderful other powerful scene in the film where interviewing the barber who is an excon who i forget what 
his name do you remember at his ellie brett sc ellie brett and he explains when he was in 
still a very young guy the punishment for them misbehaving was that their library was taken away and the 
actually went on strikes to get their library privileges and it was an even maybe overly on the nose 
of the power structures trying to keep the people from learning things and yeah preaching to the converted once 
i certainly think that even though i would i have a lot of data about this i would love 
see some more social science research but i have this feeling that the more educated we make people the 
off the world is in some large scale way at yeah when ellie told me that story my jaw 
dropped because it was actually so it was it was actually end of two thousand fifteen when i interviewed 
and i thought i knew a lot about criminal justice and what people go through but just the fact 
he had to be part of a struggle for something so basic as the right to read right sc 
at and then it was very interesting because when the film was released it premiered at the toronto international 
festival and there was a wave of prison strikes happening around north america and there was actually a strike 
nova scotia canada chuckle at and the demands of the prisoners there was want the library taken the library 
so this only makes if you look back on history this he says it used to be illegal for 
like me black people to read and it was a crime to teach a slave how to read i 
just reading a history of the labor movement in the us books and reading materials magazines used to be 
from factories and it was not because they want people to take it it was that they want people 
engaging in the life of the mind at so i think the thing is that there is something very 
about an educated public and i think that that feeds into the attacks on public education and higher education 
in this country and so not behind us still part of the struggle and so the film aims to 
that sense of urgency of just how unjust things are when kids and even adults are having to fight 
for basic access to materials and to having what they need to learn but then also saying does that 
what does that say about the broader structure and what does that say about those of us for whom 
education system has basically kind of worked sc yeah well something railed about for a long time to no 
whatsoever is just this weird idea we have in the us that we fund a public education through local 
taxes sort of the most obvious way that the rich can get richer and the poor can get poorer 
see no justification on the surface for thinking that if you are born into a wealthy family your public 
could be better not only could you afford to go to private schools but if you just happen to 
born into a really poor neighborhood then going to get less resources from the start at i feel like 
definitely fails the john rawlsian test sc oh yeah chuckle at right like this totally fails a rawlsian kind 
like what kind you know what zip code you were going to be into born into would you accept 
as a principle for funding education sc right at no way it makes sc in the original position you 
never accept this right at right right from the original position you would never this makes a farce out 
the idea of education but as i point out in the book education is not a right not in 
bill of rights when we think about what our democracy is and these values that might be attached to 
i think education is a good one just like we said political equality requires a baseline of economic equality 
the baseline of education so i think that in theory should be a right but not a right on 
in this world sc yeah at maybe i think in human rights law but not nationally and something we 
forget because it feels like a shibboleth or something like that sc well yeah at but equalizing funding for 
i think would be such a rational first step of it education reform sc yeah alright well when they 
us to be at dictators sc dictators of the world the benevolent dictators let us make it clear at 
i have a but i have a very odd educational background because i was unschooled so i go to 
as a kid and i think that that to me i feel like we have the horizon the democratic 
in terms of education and creating this philosophical public that i believe could be is i think involves working 
the system as it is and imagining how to expand it and fulfill its promise but then i also 
about what could go beyond that so when i was a kid i go to school the idea was 
very sort of rousseauian romantic idea my parents thought human beings are naturally curious and so instead of giving 
and sticks and grades and tests and stuff just let your kids do to follow their curiosity and so 
think that scales and i really sc no at obviously as discussed believe in public education but something for 
the next level would be expanding more of that trust the trust of okay letting people get in touch 
what their interests are and i think that because i think that trust is actually really essential to democracy 
again this idea that going to rule ourselves so that makes no sense if you actually have some trust 
other people so i like what would come next if we could just make sure every kid had access 
a decent school and a hot lunch and the supplies they need what would come after that sc yeah 
i well a really deep question here that i think that we that i hear much discussion about on 
one hand i think that among the choices one as a responsible grownup adult should be allowed to make 
want to learn anything i think some of us are just naturally going to do it all the time 
fun part of who we are i want to force it on anybody if a big believer that we 
need to do a better job of appreciating the simple pleasures of people who are not interested in the 
of things interested okay but when a i would almost be on the flip side of that it worked 
great for you previous mindscape guest malcom maciver also is a canadian and selfschooled i know maybe some connection 
at interesting yeah sc yeah and he turned out really really well professor at northwestern etcetera but i can 
plenty of kids for whom that would not work so i do believe that there should be some minimal 
out there where when below a certain age you gotta go to school you gotta teach us some stuff 
remember my love for philosophy only came about because it was required courses when i was an undergraduate i 
no idea that i would be interested in that and i was forced into it and i fell in 
at no and had that experience too where i had to take something and then i was like my 
was blown by it and not something i would have found before so i think again this thing with 
how do you find that balance of sort of i write this in the book but i think one 
that the unschooling experience gave and again sort of this thing how do you institutionalize it was i came 
really respect other intellectual authority because they knew things i wanted to learn and so i engage because i 
a teacher i sort of afraid of teachers i afraid of being punished or afraid of detention and or 
of doing badly or getting in trouble somehow so i think there is somehow a way to square this 
and to cultivate a space where where just a more positive experience too and where the person introducing you 
an academic discipline for the first time also also just this figure disciplining you sc yeah no i at 
this way so what you see with these kids in the scene in the film is that got these 
teachers who probably have a classroom of forty students have the resources they need and so there the space 
just the capacity to have that experience of really learning and having that introduction to a topic that really 
them and i know so but who i am and how i approach the world is so shaped by 
very eccentric upbringing and no denying it sc have you did you watch the wire the tv show at 
i seen it sc season four of the wire is enough to convince you to despair of any possibility 
public education as it is currently constituted but we would like to do better yeah and i think that 
big part science in particular what you just said resonates extremely strongly the idea that the way that we 
teach sciences here are some facts you should learn them and then tell them back to us on the 
the way that we do science is a constant series of failures of making proposals hypotheses testing them they 
wrong go back and forth and that simple paradigm is very helpful even if not doing science a way 
looking at the world that come across in education and partly because the teachers are not really scientists not 
that way partly harried and they have enough resources and they have too many kids and certainly for a 
met substitute teachers who worked in really bad school districts and literally more than one person independently volunteered that 
goal is to have no one die when there not about the life of the mind at yeah sc 
just the physical integrity of the students in their class and themselves at right and just like in the 
country in the world we can do better sc yeah you would like to think that okay to switch 
a little bit you said something very important very provocative and that written down here we gotten a chance 
get back to but the existence of structures within the democratic process within government that are antidemocratic or at 
contra democratic the supreme court the senate the electoral college all of these things that prevent the democracy from 
the unfiltered will of the people and a big believer in not having the unfiltered will of the people 
everything as someone who lives in california and is subject to these weird ballot initiatives that i think are 
terrible idea sc but tradeoffs in some sense the minority that is being protected by the senate and the 
court right now are not the minorities that deserve protection the most so do you do you have either 
about that or something more programmatic about what we should do about that to be a more healthy democracy 
yeah i mean interesting i think you just is something quite key which minorities are being protected by these 
and so when we talk about minority rights we often think at least speaking as a liberal person here 
of women even though not really a minority just a minority in positions of power and influence sc but 
discriminated against groups right at traditionally discriminated against groups the disabled sexual minorities but we have to remember is 
the minorities that the founders of our political system had in mind it was different they were thinking about 
oppressed groups in some cases but they were also thinking about the opulent the rich and they were very 
about this and so another minimal definition of democracy that i think is great is from aristotle who also 
not a democrat but he so classically in political philosophy the different systems are organized they say okay well 
is the rule of the one which is the monarchy or the rule of the many is oligarchy and 
rule of the many is democracy and plato sorry and aristotle sort of takes that he sort of says 
so democracy is the rule of the many but even more significantly than that the rule of the poor 
the poor always numerically outnumber the rich at and so the people who created our political system were very 
of that they had studied their ancient their ancient greece and they understood that they wanted to protect minorities 
as someone who in my own personal organizing i organize something called the debt collective which is a union 
debtors so we focus a lot around issues of student debt and fighting student debt james madison was very 
that you need to protect the minority against the wicked projects of the majority and one of the wicked 
would be debt abolition so like his worst nightmare so i think we have in the book so each 
in the book is a tension that i think we have to hold to this tension of inclusion or 
and the tension between expertise and mass opinion and then the tension one spontaneity and structure this question of 
do we structure our democracy at and these structures even if you look at the history of the us 
institutions they were designed to protect an affluent minority and yet they played different roles depending on the historical 
so there were periods when the supreme court was very reactionary look at decisions like plessy v ferguson when 
was standing in the way of racial progress but then there was the sort of heyday of the when 
we still hold up decisions like brown v boe and now i think moving into a very different political 
with the supreme court so i think this is where your abstract philosophical models just be too absolute because 
is messy it depends on the power dynamics in the here and now at i think we we need 
see these at least this is me putting less my philosopher hat on and more my organizer hat but 
need to see these structures as malleable they might be really really hard to change but they are changeable 
have changed really recently if things that we take for granted like direct election of senators that was a 
amendment we can see examples i mean there have been the voting rights act was like the this is 
not long sc we were alive some of us yes at we have barely even tried this democracy thing 
our current minimal definition and so i think we need to see these things as changeable so a phrase 
used that actually that i want to go back to so you said democracy is one person one right 
is a sc that is something that gets said yes at right that sounds true very new principle that 
is also from the supreme court it made its way into supreme court jurisprudence in i think so it 
said by john lewis during the famous march on washington said by john lewis and he said person one 
he actually said person one he said it because a america was not doing it because of segregation and 
crow constraints that were basically totally suppressing the vote of black people in the south but he said person 
vote is the african cry and it should be our cry why did he say that he said it 
it was actually a phrase that was being promoted by the anc in south africa and nelson mandela and 
at that point they were these south african marxists right sc yeah at and now here we are this 
phrase this beautiful ideal comes from south africa through the civil rights movement and now we take it for 
like yeah one person one vote that just makes well no really new and the question i think we 
to ask ourselves now is is it even democratic so a we have it because people are disenfranchised felons 
disenfranchised and not given the right to vote but okay so you can have one vote you can access 
ballot but what if your not weighted equally which not in our sc in the senate for example because 
the electoral college you mean at because of the electoral college or because of the way districts are apportioned 
at the state level so you can have within the state your vote for a member of congress can 
weigh more or less than someone a few counties away so the senate if every state gets the same 
of senators but you have a state that has a couple million people versus california where you are your 
vote weighs almost nothing so i would say why we expand the idea of person one to say person 
equally weighted but then i would say that even go far enough we could actually push for one person 
votes or four votes through something like ranked choice voting where you would no longer have to worry about 
your vote say and ending up with a split ticket where you cast a ballot but it actually helps 
the person you like the least at so rankedchoice is voting is now happening in maine happening in a 
community in michigan i think massachusetts is adopting it right so people actually have three votes and they get 
rank first preference second preference third preference in the book i also point out well what about the principle 
one person no vote because what if we abandoned elections entirely and use sortition so i think just going 
these sc sorry what is that what is sortition do i know what that is chuckle at sortition is 
lottery sc oh okay yes i remember that right at yeah what if so to go back to athens 
they thought elections were aristocratic because the rich and the wellborn would win sc crazy idea who would know 
at right or today we might say the reality tv stars but that actually it was a contest that 
reinforced privilege so they had very elaborate systems of randomly selecting citizens and engaging the public in the running 
the affairs and so again to quote aristotle he said you know are aristocratic and selection is and i 
quite an you know a thought experiment effectively in the united states today but to say well our elections 
as they are currently run are they really and so yeah maybe one person one vote is holding us 
maybe one person no vote will be progress sc now you have me thinking about doing it using quantum 
so that there are different branches of the wave function with completely different rulers in every branch that would 
amazing chuckle at okay so that is the next level galaxy brain but to bring it back to bring 
to earth brain sure you saw the news that ireland by referendum actually decided that they would amend their 
and open the way to allow abortion right sc yeah at so this seems like a very like just 
of those political issues i mean talking about this catholic country how would that ever get resolved why the 
went the way it did and had so much democratic legitimacy was in part because the country was at 
breaking point so they used sortition they used lottery so what they did was they created this citizens assembly 
selected ninetynine citizens at random who sort of were representative in quotes of the nation and they deliberated for 
months sc i did not know that detail wow at and they came yeah and then they came up 
recommendations and they said really thought about this and talked to all these experts and we really think actually 
constitution is antiquated and should and that gave the sense of democratic legitimacy that would have been missing otherwise 
would have just been this very destructive vote kind of like these other referendums seen but instead they used 
in a way that kind of allowed there to be a sense that the people of ireland had sought 
and been heard and the citizens assembly have power they then make a determination they made a recommendation that 
listened to sc i yeah at i just the point is we have to remember that these are malleable 
human beings made them and they can be changed and you know history shows they can often only be 
with real struggle sc sure at so a tactical issue a strategic issue chuckle but you know we should 
buy into the myth that what we have is democracy and this is the be all and end all 
no not at all and i think that the lottery idea would probably be laughed out of court in 
lot of parts of the united states but i get it i get the sense that much more democratic 
not all of these layers of filters of political advertising and you know you need to be a millionaire 
run for office and stuff like that you know i just had this thought over the course of this 
but completely onboard with having a third chamber of congress which is just randomly selected people from the united 
at exactly and i think so i think honed in on exactly how one has to approach it you 
how do you put it into the mix with other methods and other approaches of doing democracy chuckle this 
finding the new religion and being like for lottery to solve all of our problems all the chuckle at 
you know actually given the problems with the system that we have right now which is you know who 
the capacity to run for office what are the incentives and how much money do they have to raise 
then well what are they thinking about when serving when serving as public officials thinking about reelection right so 
know if there was another house that was the house chuckle that was where citizens were called up at 
yeah have a whole different set of concerns and all sorts of political scientists have done research about how 
reduce corruption of this hypothetical body and how one would educate these citizen leaders about issues so actually all 
of really interesting work and again we can point to the example of ireland but you know i think 
know one trick going to save us sc no no no sure but i like it because at interesting 
makes us think in a different way it is an outside the box thing and there are issues with 
current system and thinking outside the at there are chuckle sc is a good thing so many things i 
to talk about but one that is major and we need to get to is the idea that a 
on the one hand the will is legitimizing the government on the other hand there is this agreement on 
part of the people to abide by what happens right whether you want to call it norms or a 
to pluralism or value diversity or whatever number one is this good and number two is it tenable like 
we seeing that people these days are less willing to put up with what other people are deciding for 
the coercion part of your check review book at yeah interesting i mean i i was talking to this 
who is a civil rights lawyer in north carolina and she said something that really resonated with me and 
said know why it is that so hard to build things so hard to create constructive institutions and fair 
and yet so easy to destroy so easy for things to fall sc the second law thermodynamics we know 
true at entropy sc entropy yeah it increases chuckle at yeah funny so i was thinking about that as 
read your great book on time and i was like there needs to be political theory of and so 
think because of this and just say a law of the universe that gives us authority because of this 
have to we have to try to value the norms we have to fight for them and we have 
fight to make norms more just and so as a woman but i think as a citizen we should 
be able to say norms have actually been really norms can be they can be really regressive they can 
dehumanizing all sorts of terrible things have been legal and are legal slavery was legal and right now living 
world where fighting to make destroying the environment and poisoning the population legal at so we want to fetishize 
for their own sake but i just i do think we want to be attuned to the fact that 
very difficult very difficult to build things and entropy will get us and i think you do see i 
at a point where the american people are just like total nihilists sc no no no not at all 
maybe at i think there sc maybe the momentum i know maybe a at but i okay so this 
again going to put on my organizer hat when the rules of the game are so corrupt people are 
and i think cynicism is really toxic for a democracy i think this is the legacy of even the 
era it was not good for the project of people coming together and wanting to build a better government 
it did it helped lay this groundwork of people just being really cynical about the power structures but that 
is merited and so for me when i try to engage people my instinct you tell people like no 
really great the greatest country on earth and everything i think you have to say yeah this right we 
have a system where the members of congress are mostly millionaires and indeed there is a system of legalized 
that we call a campaign donations in law being at work at but we have to speak to cynicism 
their despair and try to build a coalition and give them credible alternatives and build a social block that 
push for real change so i think when we see this volatility tempting to be afraid of it and 
know i guess for me like now we have to throw ourselves into it and speak to it and 
solidarity and create strategies that can be a path a path and the hard work of organizing not really 
work of philosophizing and you have to speak to this is the cliche of community organizing but you have 
speak to real direct needs and try to find a sort of winwin solution out of the mess sc 
and a balancing act right we want to overthrow everything every twenty years as jefferson somewhat playfully suggested but 
norms do matter because a protective aspect to them but also an antiprogress aspect to them i do think 
the way parenthetically that there probably is a very good analogy to be drawn between the body politic and 
biological bodies when it comes to entropy and organization and homeostasis our bodies would left to their own devices 
decay and we would die but instead we take in fuel and we use that to upkeep and maintain 
and there is some work that is necessary to make that happen and sure the same thing is true 
society or a government at it was interesting i was talking to a political theorist the other today about 
metaphor of the social body it comes into my film so the film begins with sitting with silvia federici 
a museum and looking at a painting and we talk about the image in front of us an image 
a vice but of a envy and sighing and we talk about how the social body is being sawed 
right now and the social body is this metaphor that is constant in political philosophy and body politic and 
has it can often have almost fascist undertones or even overtones because people start to go like okay they 
to have this kind of ethnonationalist body to keep the foreigners at bay and so our point in our 
was like well hold on but actually be more biological about it nobody is an island in isolation all 
are impermeable we have our microbiomes and we have to eat as you just said and so where is 
myth of this body that is autonomous and independent and cut off from the world sc and we at 
that generate other bodies and other human beings so like actually embrace that permeability sc well the quintessential open 
said we can eat well or eat badly we can exercise or sit around and i think the analogy 
actually pretty good and physics underlying all of it as you will not be surprised to learn at this 
science now science laughter sc and one of the aspects there is that with bodies either literal or political 
environment that embedded in is changing darwinian evolution never stops working but the pressures that push us one way 
the other are different depending on our environments when it comes to politics where technology is changing things very 
we have different media that teach us things is that again just ask this openended question are you given 
media and cable news and talk radio and whatever how do you balance whether this is good or bad 
how can we use it as a force for better at yeah well on the social media question i 
say everyone should just read my book the platform which came out in and the platform is my analysis 
social media it was it came out at a time where people were a bit more technoutopian than they 
today but i think my basic argument still holds which is we separate the technology from the business models 
it and specifically from the business model of advertising and data collection and so the internet not intrinsically but 
because this is sort of i think just the way our media landscape worked it was just it was 
also ran on ads so did newspapers and now the sort of gloves are off for data collection and 
behavioral targeting and all of this stuff and so sc my podcast will be taking ads but not targeted 
any way just like which companies happiest shilling for basically i get to veto places that not interested already 
well i go into any details but people asked me to advertise on the podcast and i look at 
selling and like i do at well the thing is all embroiled in the system and part of the 
trying to make too is that this if i had a podcast i would also veto ads and maybe 
taking others but the point is that all in an advertising economy whether we want to or not because 
offered ostensibly free services but actually paying with our personal data so i think they have to be attuned 
the way that this business model is creating the kind of click bait economy that we are seeing and 
is very detrimental for deliberation and debate because ultimately if what the platform is more interested in serving you 
bunch of headlines that just going to look at and then get to the next one as opposed to 
incentivized to give you a long and the fact that we even have the word long read now sort 
a sign of the times at but rather have me click a lot than have me read something that 
an hour and so interesting we kind of say like so hard to read something long online well is 
necessarily or is it because actually all of the research has been geared towards pushing us in the opposite 
a quote in the platform like greatest minds of my generation are all just figuring out how to make 
click on laughter so on the one hand obviously a human temperament to be distracted and to believe falsehoods 
is why in the republic plato is basically talking about the fake news of his day again democracy elevate 
wise people believe lies they gossip misguided but unfortunately we have this whole technological apparatus that because its priorities 
accumulating profits through data collection are really antithetical to our needs as citizens and human beings and it is 
a continuation of the television model a reason that the former head of cbs said not good for america 
he sure is good for sc so the implication seems to be that we have to be vigilant and 
active steps to make sure that this trample us under foot in some sense at yeah i think though 
is where the economy is stupid like we have to i think a really daunting task but what are 
do we transform the underlying incentives that are shaping our media sphere i mean this we see so i 
in the education space and i see the difference between people who go to a traditional fouryear public college 
people who go to a predatory forprofit college a difference and right now almost no public media in the 
states of america just not something that exists and there is no sort of intrinsic reason why we experiment 
other modes of subsidy online in fact the internet was a noncommercial was a noncommercial academic invention big business 
us the internet or the worldwide web and so and this is why there are lots of people who 
kind of nostalgic for the early days of the internet before it was fully commercialized but i think we 
very heartening to me that people are finally having conversations about breaking up big tech but i think we 
to go a step further and go what other ways could we fund things that just the sort of 
or patreon donation models sc yeah at but a canadian laughter and go public media and in fact what 
democracy was funded by the national film board of canada and so this is an anecdote i often give 
in i went to my new york city literary agent and i have a very good literary agent in 
fancy agency and i said want to write a book on and she said way that is career suicide 
will never then i went to the national film board of canada and i said want to make a 
about which i think it should be harder to sc that sounds like a harder sell yeah at to 
a green light for and they were like great exactly what here for to spur public debate about interesting 
so i get a democracy project off the ground until after donald trump was elected and then everybody was 
now we care at maybe we should think about this but i think it said something about why in 
mess in and also about funding structures that can hold different kinds of work and different kinds of thinking 
so that so the final question that suggesting an answer to it already but what makes you optimistic what 
the things we can do i take it that both on the side that democracy is a good thing 
it can be a flawed thing and it is like the body an open system that needs constant care 
maintenance and improvement so where do you see that coming from at i see hope in the attitudes of 
people right now and someone so against fetishizing young people in this sort because i think we need public 
from people of all ages and backgrounds in fact when i was in my i used to joke that 
to the baby boomers i was like not trust not that you trust people sorry the baby boomers were 
like trust anyone over right sc yeah at only the youth get it sc hope i die before i 
old chuckle at yeah my attitude was like you trust people over thirty so they show they actually are 
to these but i think you we see this is a generation that has every reason on someone to 
just be totally disgusted totally cynical look at the person who occupies the white house look at happening with 
change people have known about climate scientists have known about climate change the leaders of the most powerful corporations 
earth leaders and government have known since long before these kids were born and they chose to suppress it 
deny it and actively subsidize these industries sc yeah at and so they should have every reason to just 
completely disgusted and yet here they are striking for the climate going out week after week they are pushing 
gun control we see this wave of really idealistic people in their late and early running for office and 
is a market shift so i was part of occupy wall street that was only two thousand eleven and 
attitude there was no way no engaging with the system on that level we refuse to even make demands 
this corrupted government sc it was a weird time at right and we can debate the pros and cons 
that and we can debate the purpose occupy served because i think it i think it was important even 
it was ineffectual in many ways but happy to see people going beyond that and saying willing to get 
hands dirty and step into the fray because we have eleven years and going and if we do it 
so i never have trouble finding hope i almost find hopelessness to be kind of trite because i think 
you have a historical gaze impossible to deny the fact that people have had it so much harder than 
sc yeah at so then like well here we are talking on skype chuckle sc technically not on skype 
the way but yes on the internet right at oh no not skype squadcast sorry sc there you go 
and yeah just have some perspective been worse been worse and in the book i say something like try 
be good ancestors try to be the people we would respect if we were looking back it mean that 
have to win but we have to try sc yeah the click baity media landscape notwithstanding i get some 
from the fact that a remarkable number of people are interested in listening to hourlong conversations about the nature 
democracy chuckle at i hope so or else going to be chuckle sc i think they are at no 
answers but i the book ends with this image of not aspire to be founding fathers but perennial midwives 
is something we just have to do over and over and over again and what it means to get 
in enlarging democracy deepening democracy it really does depend on where you are in your community and what the 
around you care about there sure we can say easy things like or something like that but that should 
an hour of your time sc yeah sc the other questions they have a lot of specificity and we 
and not questions we can answer by ourselves sc and sort of the right way to think of this 
impulse not to overthrow the government every twenty years but to continually renew it by actually engaging with it 
think there i agree with you the historical view gives us actually believe it or not some source of 
at oh yeah no things have been bad chuckle at things are bad sc things are bad but they 
worse and they could be better but only if we do it it happen automatically right at yeah and 
could be better so i think this i always recommend studying social movements and thinking about all the work 
has done to get us where we are today so keep going sc alright keep going astra taylor thanks 
much for being on the podcast at hey thanks for having me it was really fun enjoyable podcast should 
want to consider some thoughts on revising our approach to democracy please consider larry book more or see his 
summary at httpwwwamoreperfectconstitutioncom sabato is a tenured professor at the university of virginia and founder of the center for 
you mentioned your feeling about education and a lack of social science data i picked up that the only 
way of preventing recidivism is education in prison caveat it has to be to degree level if i remember 
i heard this on this podcast back in april guests professor james gilligan clinical professor of psychiatry adjunct professor 
the school of law collegiate professor in the school of arts and science new york university professor pieter spierenburg 
of historical criminology erasumus university the netherlands httpwwweshcceurnlspierenburg professor bandy lee assistant clinical professor of psychiatry yale university usa 
folks might be able to help you with your pursuit of further social science knowledge on the importance of 
great to hear a mention of sortition référence sortition astra mentioned ireland the abortion issue and the assembly we 
to hear much in the mainstream media about sortition i wonder why i was surprised that sean had not 
of it or about iceland the icelanders recently after the gfc jettisoned the seven or eight families who have 
that country for the last years and are implementing elements of sortition into their new democracy in france some 
are working towards something called sociocracy sortition is a part of this interesting that in this and the last 
podcasts you talk about predictions of the future like one hundred years from now or more with the permafrost 
greenland melting and the arctic ablaze i think the future is going to involve more democracy or fancy new 
life the road maybe the evil white men who wrote the united states constitution understood that human beings are 
to failure governments are prone to injustice and that revolution is inevitable in systems that lack sufficient elasticity therefore 
wrote a constitution that can be changed without revolution so long as the people do not forget their rights 
responsibilities with respect to governance the most troubling aspect of modernity is the increasing tendency for citizens to hold 
hand out to the government with a sense of entitlement all good things must to be free the government
