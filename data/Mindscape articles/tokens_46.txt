episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today we 
another episode of quantum mechanics i know this makes everyone very excited today talking to adam becker who is 
phd in physics but has gone the route of becoming a freelance science writer and most interestingly for our 
purposes the author of a book called what is real this is a really wonderful book been recommending it 
and left about the history of quantum mechanics in the century but not the typical history most histories of 
mechanics focus on from one thousand nine hundred to and what adam really does is look at what happens 
he does a little bit of the early stuff but the point is that as i talk about it 
my own book something deeply hidden this weird thing where quantum mechanics is invented it comes with this giant 
called the measurement problem what really happens when you measure a quantum system why do the rules seem to 
different etcetera and then after a very brief flurry of interest in talking about the measurement problem with people 
bohr and einstein and schrodinger going back and forth forgotten just dropped in fact it becomes disreputable to even 
about the measurement problem sc so adam really digs into the history of the people who refused to be 
when talking about this huge problem in physics the plucky band of rebels who really said actually this is 
important thing we need to think about so he talks about hugh everett of course but also david bohm 
bell a lot of the experimentalists like clauser and aspect and others who really tackled this problem and tried 
remind the physics community that despite what their advisors told them the measurement problem in quantum mechanics is really 
important so not about here solving the measurement problem about the history of how physicists talked about that problem 
a fascinating history with colorful characters so both learn a little bit about quantum mechanics but also learn a 
bit about the history and sociology of physics which is really much more fascinating than it has any right 
be so go music sc adam becker welcome to the mindscape podcast adam becker well thanks for having me 
to be here sc of course this is a slightly unusual show just all slightly unusual i know why 
keep saying that ab sure sc but quantum mechanics i should say this is a slightly usual show the 
topic i do the most coming out with a book on quantum mechanics now i do quantum mechanics for 
but written a book already out about quantum mechanics so for the purposes of this interview gonna pretend that 
know much about quantum mechanics if okay gonna try to get it out from you ab sure sc and 
is it okay to characterize your book as a history of quantum mechanics ab yeah i think what it 
yeah definitely a history of quantum mechanics it is i would say a somewhat unusual history of quantum mechanics 
i think a good history of quantum mechanics but biased sc well unusual i guess gonna say that in 
sense that history a set of things that happen but you have an angle right you have a theme 
i have an angle one of the things that makes it unusual in that i think that the dominant 
on what quantum mechanics says this thing called the copenhagen interpretation but also goes by other names like the 
interpretation or whatever i am not a fan to put it mildly the other thing though that i think 
my book somewhat unusual as a history of quantum mechanics there are a lot of other popular histories of 
mechanics out there and most of them start in say one thousand nine hundred with max plank and then 
say plank found the black body radiation law and that was the beginning of the quantum and then they 
forward from that with einstein and the photoelectric effect and bohr and his model of the atom and then 
end with then heisenberg and schrodinger developed fullyfledged modern quantum mechanics and everybody lived happily ever after and then 
einstein and bohr got into a fight but bohr won and then thirty years later john bell did a 
and the end of the book my book inverts that structure i only have a chapter or two at 
beginning about the very early days of quantum mechanics and most of the book focuses on stuff that happened 
say one thousand nine hundred fortyfive onward after world war ii sc which is fascinating just if any people 
there in the audience who think quantum mechanics is fun but history is not really really illuminating to go 
this particular kind of history because you see where people got certain attitudes and quantum mechanics is hard and 
shows us a lot about physics and the physics community right ab yeah yeah i mean i think that 
is general attitude or idea among some physicists and some scientists of various stripes that history and personalities and 
really matter that much in science and really reflected in science and just wrong sc just the objective truth 
what are you talking about we just find the truth and we lay it out there for people ab 
clearly true science is a body of facts not a human process yeah but science is a human process 
and affected by all other human processes which is not to say that science is just bullshit that people 
up sc well we certainly make choices along the way about how to do science right important what questions 
tackle and so forth and quantum mechanics is a great example so why you give your version of what 
quantum mechanics ab oh boy quantum mechanics is a phenomenally successful physical theory it is the best theory we 
to account for the behavior and predict the behavior of very small objects but also things that are constituted 
very small objects which is basically everything and so quantum so one definition of quantum mechanics is it well 
on quantum physics right sc i care quantum theory quantum physics quantum mechanics those mean the same thing ab 
mechanics we usually use that for the nonrelativistic theory but anyway yeah quantum physics because this theory for tiny 
and things made of tiny things which is everything basically our best physical theory of everything with a little 
on it and the asterisk is general relativity which is a whole other thing but basically anything where gravity 
that much where that much means matters less than it does i know inside of the heart of a 
star or near a black hole quantum mechanics is fantastic sc okay but what does it actually say imagine 
is listening who just know about uncertainty or wave functions or anything like that ab yeah well the question 
mechanics so one way of answering the question is quantum mechanics is this really good mathematical tool for predicting 
outcomes of experiments and predicting how various physical phenomena will play out as for what it tells us is 
on in the world a question of interpreting the mathematical structure and the results of the experiments that we 
and exactly at stake in the story that telling in my book the question of how to interpret this 
successful theory to figure out what telling us about the world is very controversial and has been since the 
days of quantum mechanics back in the and even before i mean i think actually said the name of 
book yet but why the title of my book is what is real not a finished story and that 
is the question at hand sc yeah you do notice this whenever trying to talk whenever trying to talk 
quantum mechanics is that you say anything about what the theory says without choosing a formulation of it without 
sides in these interpretation wars ab exactly yeah i could say something that would make you as a many 
person very happy and say quantum mechanics tells us that things can be in more than one place at 
in different universes and very small systems composed of a very small number of things can interfere with their 
in other universes but then when you get larger aggregate number of things that happen as much unless you 
special that would make a lot of people very angry if i said that that was what quantum mechanics 
without qualification sc read into it adam you gotta be able to make people angry ab chuckle oh worry 
have no trouble making people angry there are a lot of people angry with me sc why we just 
a little bit historical and imagine that we are there at the solvay conference right the fifth international for 
of you who know this was i think ab yes sc this it was the moment when quantum mechanics 
right ab yeah sc and all the great bright people in the physics world were there and they chatted 
out and tempers flared ab exactly yeah no this i know in la it was the oscars of quantum 
right so yeah this was a major major conference in one thousand nine hundred twentyseven in belgium and all 
the key players in the formulation of quantum mechanics or almost all of them were there sc so for 
ab yeah so for example albert einstein was there niels bohr the great danish physicist was there louis de 
was there werner heisenberg was there erwin schrodinger was there max born sc planck was there ab yeah planck 
there sc pauli ab pauli marie curie sc dirac everyone ab dirac yeah everybody was i think rutherford was 
everyone was there and this was a great comingout party for the version of quantum mechanics or the way 
thinking about quantum mechanics that heisenberg and born and bohr and pauli had cobbled together which is not to 
that those four were the only ones involved nor is it to say that those four all agreed with 
other but they agreed enough that they were able to put together a presentation that they gave and specifically 
presentation that born and heisenberg i believe gave in which they said the theory how it works done a 
theory and you add anything to it and it let you say anything about going on before you take 
sc and this is what we call the copenhagen interpretation ab yes or a version of the copenhagen interpretation 
no one agrees on what the copenhagen interpretation is ab yeah no one agrees the other thing sc but 
what we teach our students today ab we teach our students something that plausibly goes by that name yeah 
right laughter ab another way of answering your earlier question of what quantum mechanics is and get back to 
solvay conference quantum mechanics is a pair of rules for predicting going to happen in the world one of 
rules is this thing called the schrodinger equation which is exactly the kinda thing that we love to have 
a law of nature it is deterministic a beautiful partial differential equation very very pretty it says that there 
these things in the or that there are things whether in the world is controversial laughter sc really hard 
make a sentence here ab so hard chuckle sc but there are things ab there are things called wave 
and as the name implies they wave and they ungulate in a way that is perfectly predictable through the 
mathematics of the schrodinger equation and then there is this other thing called the born rule and the born 
look like a normal law of nature nature it look like the laws of nature that physicists were accustomed 
in the which is not in and of itself a strike against it fine sc sure we could be 
and new implied ab exactly or can be good but the born rule sc named after max born not 
concept of being born ab true yes named after max born and the same with schrodinger equation is named 
erwin schrodinger and to give credit where credit is due heisenberg came up with something like the schrodinger equation 
was something that was mathematically equivalent but max born he said these wave functions there is another way that 
behave when you look at something that has a wave function associated with it or when you take a 
of something that has a wave function associated with it which is supposed to be everything in quantum mechanics 
wave function collapses it goes to zero everywhere except in one spot or in one in spot or in 
sc one value ab yeah one value everything but one value goes to zero and which one going to 
is probabilistic which one is going to not be zero is probabilistic and you can determine that by looking 
the values of the wave function the moment before you make the measurement and the problem is that these 
rules for how wave functions work contradict each other sc right ab and so the question when do you 
one and when do you use the other one sc so one rule for when not looking at it 
another rule for when you are ab yeah something like that and so the question is which one do 
use when and the traditional answer the copenhagen answer is to say you use the born rule this collapse 
when looking at things when making a measurement and use the schrodinger equation for when not what do we 
by looking a measurement what counts as a measurement who has to do it right do you need a 
to do a measurement sc what if you just glance at it ab what if you just glance at 
what if a monkey does it what if a bacterium does in all these questions so this assorted host 
questions that go along with this one core question of which rule do we use when the measurement problem 
right the measurement problem of quantum mechanics ab yeah and the copenhagen interpretation claims to have a solution to 
claims to have many solutions to this because the copenhagen interpretation any one thing but at the solvay conference 
solution that was proposed was not right not good scientific practice to talk about going on when not looking 
so the philosophical maneuver that they made ab yes it is something along those lines and not everyone was 
with this in particular albert einstein was very unhappy with this and so he starts getting into it with 
born in particular but really the rest of them as well he proposes a couple of thought experiments to 
to get around this to show why this quite be right or at least be the whole story he 
misunderstood basically right off the bat and this goes on for years sc well this popular idea that einstein 
handle or keep up with quantum mechanics ab yeah and such a strange myth sc the opposite of true 
yeah the opposite of true which usually we call that false but i mean einstein first of all was 
of the founders of quantum mechanics his one thousand nine hundred five paper on the photoelectric effect postulated the 
of quantized packets of light photons and hardly the only work he did on quantum mechanics throughout his career 
did a lot of very very important work on quantum mechanics both before and though probably less after the 
modern formulation of quantum mechanics shows up in the there is no evidence whatsoever that he keep up with 
he definitely understood it sc yeah sc he spent a lot of time thinking about it he once said 
he spent more time thinking about quantum mechanics or i think the phrase was that he used up more 
grease on the quantum mechanics than he did on relativity which is what more known for i mean hell 
got the nobel prize for his work on quantum mechanics not for his work on relativity which is a 
historical quirk and nobel prizes that important anyway but yeah sc so he was upset and i think it 
perfect sense if you know a lot about quantum mechanics i think you should sympathize with why he was 
at the solvay conference both because there are these two different rules that you use under different circumstances and 
because it all seemed so illposed right ab yeah sc the whole point of physics is to be precise 
beautiful and exact and this hand wavy thing about making measurements somehow sneaked in ab yeah yeah i mean 
had what was at the time a fairly commonsense view of what physics was about he said is about 
in the world and now telling me physics is about predicting the outcomes of experiments an experiment if really 
about predicting the outcomes of experiments then how are we supposed to use it to explain things that happen 
the natural world when not which people were doing already at the time quantum mechanics has always been used 
do more than just predict the outcomes of experiments it has also been used to explain all kinds of 
interesting natural phenomena ranging from stuff as basic as why does the sun shine to why is it that 
behaves in this funny way where not really an insulator and not really a conductor a semiconductor right sc 
ab and that lets us build computers so everything from basic fundamental facts about the world around us like 
i pass my hand through the table to all sorts of strange and wonderful modern technology like leds or 
of this recording equipment sc and i you mentioned this very quickly but i wanna dwell on this philosophical 
made by the copenhagen interpretation ab yeah sc so if you really say that the job of your physical 
in this case is to simply predict the outcomes of experiments they said the advocates of copenhagen as far 
i can tell were sometimes more explicit about this than others they were never completely on the same page 
a version of it which really says that and almost solipsistic idealistic and if you really push it saying 
in the mind ab yeah sc saying the world as something that exists external to me is irrelevant to 
what is important to physics is the predictions that i can make and the observations that i can make 
yeah yeah i think that that is definitely one way to take what they were saying i think that 
is any single copenhagen interpretation and while niels bohr and max born and pauli and heisenberg and the others 
have each had their own individual positions i think that you can combine all of those to make something 
and in some cases like with niels bohr not even clear what each position was no consensus on sc 
within one overlapping conversation sc exactly yeah yeah speaking of people being mad at me this is something that 
people are mad at me for they say you said the niels bohr had this like i i say 
niels bohr had any position i know what position he had and neither this anybody sc i just quoted 
a few times in my book because if you tried to translate what he says or paraphrase people are 
be mad at you ab yeah exactly he was a brilliant physicist and a very interesting man who did 
of wonderful things and he just was not a particularly clear writer or speaker sc well david albert when 
interviewed him for the podcast he had a wonderful take on niels bohr he said that niels bohr was 
person in history who he would most like to have met personally ab yeah sc and his reason why 
because people would meet him and they would come back after talking to niels bohr and number one they 
say was the most brilliant wonderful transcendentally wise human and they would start spouting complete nonsense about the foundation 
quantum mechanics laughter sc so how can one person have this effect ab yeah no a real question i 
i know i know if the person in history most like to invite to dinner but certainly very curious 
himself sc but they did win the pr battle ab yes they did sc after solvay it more or 
became standard conventional wisdom that the copenhagen interpretation was how we think about quantum mechanics and there were a 
people who like that like einstein also schrodinger ab yeah right schrodinger did not like it sc but they 
increasingly marginalized at least in terms of how we think about quantum mechanics ab yeah exactly right yeah people 
einstein and schrodinger were outta touch and kooky and maybe they were kooky but they were not wrong i 
to have doubts about this but their work was increasingly outside of the mainstream of the work that the 
of the physics community was engaging in not in the sense that was wrong or but in that the 
of the physics community was just not thinking about these things they were working on other things and part 
that was for really obvious historical reasons this debate was going on in the early to mid mostly in 
there were some things also going on in the in europe into the that were somewhat distracting to a 
of people sc and physicists in particular had other things to worry about ab indeed yes they did yeah 
by the people were working on other things such as the manhattan project and then after the manhattan project 
the war suddenly there was this realization due to i hesitate to use the word for the manhattan project 
due to the achievements of the manhattan project there was recognition by governments and industry and the military that 
was a lot of value to be had in funding massive amounts of applied physics and so rather than 
about the foundations of quantum mechanics this influx of money and the people who came along with that were 
with working out implications of quantum physics which is a good thing to do there was a lot of 
really great science done in that period and i do think that if the attitude had been you know 
there is a problem here with the foundations come back to it later something that we need to figure 
but in the meantime we have a lot of really interesting work to do and maybe help us understand 
theory better and that will shed more light on if that had been the attitude i have had a 
to write sc yeah sc and i think a very sensible attitude there have been many other theories in 
history of science that have worked that way newton himself talked about his own theories in this way sometimes 
not what happened sorry not what happened instead it was those problems are solved we have to worry about 
foundations now we can work on these applications of the sc sorry the foundations we mean is the correct 
towards this measurement problem really just to only ask about measurement outcomes or is there some other version of 
mechanics some other way of thinking about things that is more traditionally physically scientific ab exactly yeah with this 
of money and people that came after world war ii questions like what does the theory were swept under 
rug and been a lot of really good work on how the changes in physics after world war ii 
to changes in the way that quantum mechanics was taught been done by the historian of science david kaiser 
mit who has gone back through physics curricula and textbooks from the time and found that the larger the 
the less time spent on the meaning and foundations of the theory and the more time spent on applications 
i think that makes sense easier to teach people how to solve a partial differential equation than it is 
talk about these thorny philosophical issues at the heart of the theory sc i do think that gonna get 
the plucky band of did wanna keep thinking about the ab and blew up the death star sc but 
me since my usual spiel is what a huge mistake it was to ignore the foundations try to be 
to the people who did ignore the foundation ab absolutely sc as you said a lot of applied physics 
do there was even nonapplied physics meaning when murray gellmann is working out the symmetry group the eightfold still 
of this to the military or anything like that but so what would someone back then have said if 
said you thinking about quantum mechanics as a foundational ab well i think that answers would have varied right 
answer that someone could have given was we take a look at i think this is the late early 
of nonapplied foundational work of a different kind take a look at what happened how do i describe this 
using jargon there was this little shift in the way that atoms emitted light called the lamb shift sc 
lamb shift right so a slight miscalculation between what you predicted and what you saw ab exactly yeah and 
first people just thought it would go away and then as experimental techniques and theory got better and better 
mismatch got more and more obvious until it became clear there was a real problem and this led to 
development of a new foundational theory of quantum physics called quantum electrodynamics and this is what the single piece 
work that richard feynman is most well known for as well as julian sc tomonaga ab tomonaga sc freeman 
ab freeman dyson yeah exactly sc but okay to be fair that could be classified as a particular theory 
the quantum mechanical umbrella rather than the foundations of quantum mechanics ab sure true but if you would asked 
sc it had nothing with the measurement ab right it had nothing to do with a measurement problem but 
certainly really applied right so if you asked those people you paying attention to the measurement they might have 
something like theory works very well this has all been worked out and focusing on real problems not chasing 
one possible answer another possible answer would be to say what do you rather than to say been they 
say there was never a problem right not a problem sc right ab they might take some version of 
copenhagen interpretation and really swallow it entirely and say it really is all about these observations that we make 
all that very good at doing physics physicists are very good at doing physics not always good at describing 
doing physics sc oh terrible ab yeah exactly sc okay those who cannot do teach sometimes those who can 
know how to teach ab right exactly but yeah i mean just the same way that we deny things 
of the realm of science have no influence on science you can see somebody saying no no no no 
is definitely all about the outcomes of and then go off and do something clearly not about the outcomes 
but no one ever said that before quantum mechanics right i mean i guess mok might have said that 
were philosophers of old ab yeah mok said things like that there were philosophers yeah and mock was both 
philosopher and a physicist yeah so yeah people definitely did say things like that beforehand in fact some people 
that what einstein had been saying in one thousand nine hundred five when he came up with special relativity 
that was a big inspiration for them though if you then go back and take a look at other 
from very clear that actually not really the kind of thing that he thought sc okay speaking of which 
and also schrodinger who was on his side they give up postsolvay conference and so their not giving up 
a huge boon to human kind in the sense that they basically invented entanglement right ab yeah i mean 
it forced the rest of the physics community to understand that entanglement was maybe the defining trait of quantum 
ab you should tell us what entanglement is ab yes well so another thing where no matter how i 
it going to be picking some interpretation so let me see what i can do sc so pick the 
one ab yeah pick the right one clearly yeah the joke here of course is that you have a 
interpretation of quantum mechanics and i just have an antipreferred interpretation of quantum mechanics chuckle but yeah so entanglement 
mechanics makes it very clear that under really a wide variety of circumstances you can have two things that 
widely separated sc particles or whatever ab particles or whatever really despite the fact that they are very far 
they could be on other sides of the solar system and despite the fact that no obvious connection between 
there are instantaneous correlations in experiments that you conduct on each of the two of them and you can 
for that in several different ways chuckle and another one of the things at stake in this interpretation debate 
right so the reason why so yeah you see two particles far away quantum mechanics says that when we 
them all we do is predictive probability for getting certain outcomes but what einstein and podolsky and rosen say 
the probability of getting one thing is deeply affected by doing a measurement on the other one even if 
far away ab exactly sc and this seems to violate at least the spirit of theory of special relativity 
sc so you can see why be upset about it but it actually let you send signals faster than 
speed of light or anything like that ab yeah you can prove that you use it to send signals 
that it looks like an instantaneous influence it look like something that you could use for instantaneous communication sc 
so why did einstein think this was a big deal ab einstein thought this was a big deal because 
saw no reason to believe in any kind of instantaneous influence he said if we really wanna say that 
talk about going on before we make measurements then we have to say an instantaneous influence because you make 
measurement way over here and you make a measurement way over there and they have correlated outcomes all the 
so if it really if there was really no fact of the matter before you made the measurement then 
must have been conspiring immediately across great he said could do the reasonable thing and say that when you 
sent them off in different directions they already had a agreedupon set of properties and so that lets you 
around this without saying that the two objects have the long distance conspiracy going sc so even though we 
what our measurement outcomes were the particles knew what their measurement outcomes were going to be ab exactly so 
says given that the two options are something totally normal like that or this long distance what he called 
at a he chose door number one sc yeah ab and given that those were apparently the two options 
the table at the time that seemed like a reasonable thing for him to do and the response that 
received was not great niels bohr wrote a famously impenetrable response which he later apologized for how poorly written 
was but then really proceed to elaborate on what he had meant sc i was told that part of 
was even printed in the wrong order is that a true story ab okay so right so the printing 
the wrong order this is really inside baseball so it was not originally printed in the wrong order however 
the dark days before the internet if you wanted to find reply to the epr paper the einstein podolsky 
paper you had to go find it in a book and the book where it was most famously and 
available was a book from the early called i think quantum theory and measurement a big red book and 
the i think in all of the first edition printings of that book two pages of reply were swapped 
only a four or five per reply so a pretty big difference and the story which is i think 
to verify is that nobody noticed for years sc yeah they understand it anyway what difference does it make 
order the pages are in ab and also reply served this very important social function just by existing because 
could say you have to worry about that epr thing bohr worked it out on that and so people 
read it it was just there but yeah you can now of course download it online and whatnot but 
story that i know is true i know if nobody noticed it it definitely was printed in the wrong 
when i first read it i first read reply i guess it was so i did not have to 
it from that book i did get it from the internet i have the pages in the right order 
printed them out i read it and then i went to the professor that i was working with at 
time and i said is a really bad translation is there a better translation available into i thought bohr 
native english speaker maybe this was written in sc i see where this is going ab yeah and then 
professor told me no adam he wrote this in sc yeah this is the original ab yeah so yeah 
a fabulously impenetrable reply sc but like you say it let the rest of the community say yeah and 
the way objection was not mechanics is he thought that it was just a steppingstone towards a bigger theory 
we would someday have ab exactly yeah he said that it was simply incomplete and in fact i think 
was the title of the paper quantum mechanical description of reality be considered complete not so no people thought 
einstein was wrong einstein actually wrote a letter to schrodinger shortly after the epr paper came out saying that 
had gotten letters from a couple dozen different physicists from around the world explaining why he was wrong and 
of them agreed with each other so yeah einstein and schrodinger laughing at everybody else behind their backs schrodinger 
writes a paper in support of the epr position saying this is this longdistance connection this is a fundamental 
of quantum mechanics everywhere and you really get around it and to show you another example of the same 
talk about a cat in a box with radiation and a vital and this is where the famous cat 
experiment comes from sc right ab and so schrodinger points this out as he comes up with this thought 
to explain why there must be some deeper fact about the world or so he thought that quantum mechanics 
because otherwise maybe you can have a particle not in any particular state before you look but the cat 
experiment says if you have a particle in that state you can set up an experiment where a cat 
neither dead nor alive before you and saying that a particle is a subatomic particle that we have no 
experience with is in neither one state or the other one thing but cats are either dead or alive 
are cats in this apartment right now i seen them i am sure that they are either dead or 
sc yes in fact alive ab yes sc okay yes ab yeah sc but okay just get the philosophy 
the table here sc yeah sc einstein and podolsky and rosen make this point about spooky action at a 
but they just say obviously like schrodinger with his cat his argument was really at the level of obviously 
two of you believe that ab true true no the epr thought experiment in that respect is more rigorous 
epr was a little more rigorous they wanted to make the case that if you believe that there really 
something actually happening at every location in space in ways they tried to make carefully defined and so forth 
quantum mechanics be complete and this is gonna skip ahead a little bit but then john bell comes along 
says that einstein is basically sketching out an aspiration some day have a better theory that explains all this 
spooky action at a distance and bell basically proved that no such theory can ever reproduce the predictions of 
ab yeah people have called bell the person who proved einstein wrong people have also called bell the person 
einstein right i think that neither of those are really correct though more sympathetic to the second one because 
bell proved was that einstein was right to be worried but that his proposed solution work because you can 
the epr thought experiment in this very subtle and brilliant way that will basically give you a real experiment 
you could build and the results of that experiment if they conform with the predictions of quantum mechanics be 
for with the preexisting answers that einstein had in mind for how these particles were arranging to have these 
distance correlations sc right and bell so is an example of how it was to try to do foundations 
quantum mechanics talking about and now and he was a perfectly respectable particle theorist at cern at the laboratory 
we discovered the higgs boson a few years ago and correct if wrong but he basically hid the fact 
he was working on the foundations of quantum mechanics from his colleagues at cern ab he i know is 
little bit strong sc he advertise it ab he certainly advertise it yeah there is this well is probably 
little strong there was certainly whispers about john bell at cern that he did something important in quantum foundations 
worry about it because quantum mechanics works sc yeah chuckle hold it against them ab yeah exactly yeah one 
good friends who he worked with on the other work he did not quantum foundations everyday physics work was 
quantum field theory and one of good friends was martinus veltman and the story is that veltman one day 
to bell did this thing in quantum foundations do i need to worry about this will it affect my 
in quantum field theory at and veltman is a very good quantum field theorist sc he won the nobel 
ab yes he did win the nobel prize yes and so veltman asks bell this question and bell says 
about it not gonna affect your work at which is true and so bell yeah he certainly advertise that 
was working on this stuff he also work on it in a serious way at great length until well 
his career was established and safe he thought about this stuff in college and then he thought about it 
little bit in in his early graduate work and then he was dissuaded from working on it and so 
put it off to the side and came back to it later sc and a lot of even to 
day there are physicists who will claim that what bell proved was that you have what are called hidden 
sc yeah sc that you have secret new secret new parameters of physics that as einstein had hoped would 
the outcomes of future experiments even if we human beings know about it ab yeah sc but not what 
proved in fact we have to talk about david bohm who is certainly one of the more interesting characters 
the story ab yes he is yeah so no bell certainly prove that you have these hidden variables like 
wanted bell proved that you have a particular kind of hidden variables sc ones without spooky action ab ones 
spooky action at a distance and really what he proved was not really about hidden variables at all it 
really saying that you have a theory without spooky action at a distance of some kind unless you break 
even more fundamental sc which get to later ab which get to later yeah exactly sc my man whoever 
all the day ab yeah no i think the way i describe it in my book is he showed 
you either have to have spooky action at a distance or something even weirder sc yeah ab but yeah 
david bohm right so david bohm was in a lot of ways the inspiration for work and someone whose 
bell admired very clearly david bohm was a student of robert oppenheimer the guy who was in charge of 
manhattan project though he himself he follow oppenheimer to los alamos sc why is that chuckle ab well he 
oppenheimer to los alamos because david bohm had been briefly a member of the communist party in berkeley where 
was doing his phd work and so when he applied for security clearance to go to los alamos he 
denied that clearance they did not tell him that this is why they denied him the clearance they lied 
him and told him it was because he had relatives in europe who could be held as hostage against 
which while true in theory was definitely not the real reason as documents uncovered well after bohm died proved 
yeah bohm did do some important work that was relevant to the manhattan project for his phd which was 
classified and thus removed from his apartment forcibly by military police because he have clearance to have his own 
and ab it was a crazy time talking about the early ab yeah yeah this is or something like 
more like it matter the point is during world war ii it was a crazy time like you said 
no he have any of his research notes oppenheimer had to go to the uc berkeley administration and say 
to give him a phd anyway just trust which they did which was good bohm had no problem with 
copenhagen interpretation at this time oppenheimer was a great admirer of bohr bohm was a great admirer of oppenheimer 
so he really think too critically about it and it seemed to work for him then he started teaching 
mechanics classes so teaching is gonna get you in trouble clearly sc well clearly not usually since most physicists 
to have no trouble ignoring the foundations even when they teach quantum mechanics ab fair fair sc but bohm 
a thoughtful guy ab yes bohm was a thoughtful guy he was teaching quantum mechanics classes at berkeley out 
research or sorry lecture notes and then he got a position at princeton and continued to teach out of 
mix of his own notes and notes and started turning that into a textbook and that textbook he wrote 
trying to give the best version of the copenhagen interpretation that he could and make it as clear as 
could make it and in the process of trying to do that faith in the copenhagen interpretation just plummeted 
by the end of the process he was just completely plagued with doubt sc the more you think about 
the less sense it makes ab yes i certainly agree so then bohm went and met with einstein who 
looked at textbook once it came out and called bohm into his office and said you wrote this book 
how do you feel about and bohm said plagued with and einstein said because trying to defend an indefensible 
you did the best job that you could do but no one can do it because it and so 
walked out of that meeting thinking i find another way to look at this can i find another way 
think about quantum and he did he independently rediscovered a set of ideas that louis de broglie one of 
other founders of quantum mechanics had come up with back in the late and then finished the work that 
broglie started and put together this theory which goes by a bunch of different names bohmian mechanics de brogliebohm 
pilot wave theory i like calling it pilot wave theory descriptive of the content of the theory sc also 
the way when de broglie actually tried to present his theory at the solvay conference and he was just 
out his own theory for no good reason ab yeah basically yeah i mean it is true that the 
done but he could have finished it and he yeah sc so bohm okay bohm finished that took up 
mantle ab exactly bohm took up that mantle puts this thing together relatively quickly and sends it off for 
the problem is that at the same time that all of this was happening past was catching up with 
he got called up in front of the house on american activities committee and testified in front of it 
a committee including richard nixon who was a congressman at the time and he was asked to name names 
tell people who the other people in the communist party in berkeley during world war ii were he do 
he was held in contempt of congress he was arrested in his office in princeton and by the time 
got back to campus after his friends posted bail he had been suspended and banned from the princeton campus 
he was working on all of these ideas during that suspension sc what year are we talking now ab 
is yeah yeah yeah this is so while suspended he works on these ideas about quantum mechanics and then 
his day in court cleared on all charges because it turns out that you have to name names he 
pled the first and the fifth amendments there is a first and a fifth amendment sc federal constitution ab 
exactly yeah so he was cleared on all accounts but princeton effectively fired him after that and he get 
job anywhere else even though he had recommendation letters from einstein and oppenheimer he get work doing academic physics 
in the us or europe much to his disappointment finally he gets a position in brazil and so toward 
end of he goes down to brazil and shortly after arriving summoned to the us consulate where they illegally 
his passport and tell him that he can only have it back if he goes back to the united 
which he wanna do worried that gonna be arrested again and maybe brought up on false charges or something 
trapped sc but now the height of the red scare ab exactly the height of the red scare and 
mccarthy era so bohm is trapped in brazil he get out he was planning to give a bunch of 
in support of his ideas because his papers were due to be published imminently just a couple months later 
when they are finally published in very early bohm defend his ideas through anything other than writing letters to 
and so mostly just ridiculed one of the quotes that i found in my research for my book which 
liked the best was someone said that bohm something to the effect of a very illustrious set of people 
knives in his back all year in which yeah absolutely true wolfgang pauli werner heisenberg sc yeah these are 
the political knives of being a communist these are physics knives of like a crazy person who understand quantum 
exactly yeah but the fact that he was a communist also help not only because he leave brazil but 
at that time most physics funding was coming from the military and it was the height of the red 
and so if someone in your physics department was suspected of being a communist that could turn off the 
of funding and a scary thing so yeah sc and basically to make it very very brief his theory 
pilot wave theory was the hidden variable theory that einstein wanted except rather than avoiding spooky action at a 
so spooky action is doing all the work here ab yeah riddled with spooky action at a distance sc 
was a great quote from bell saying that he resolved the epr paradox in the way that einstein would 
liked the least ab yeah something like that yeah a another quote from bell actually about theory was that 
you shook a magnet right here it would instantaneously affect the position of every single electron anywhere in the 
which is not a pleasant thing to consider as a physicist mean wrong sc isaac newton would have been 
happy ab exactly yeah newton would have been fine with it obviously the influence is very very small sc 
by the way this gone away this bohmian mechanics pilot wave theory is still one of the leading contenders 
a sensible interpretation of quantum mechanics not so much among physicists but among philosophers and people who work on 
and how would you characterize the state of play with reconciling these kinds of ideas with quantum field theory 
relativity ab yeah i mean the fundamental problem with pilot wave theory bohmian mechanics whatever you wanna call it 
that it seem to play nice with relativity for exactly these reasons relativity have a preferred frame of reference 
let you have things go faster than light bohmian mechanics seems to violate that i would have a much 
answer to your question about the state of play in about three hours getting dinner with chip sc oh 
my collaborator yes ab yeah sc we rule out the procausality here in this podcast so not a version 
quantum mechanics we like so information you will get in the future cannot propagate back to us here ab 
it be used here sc so the way that i like to put it just trying to reality check 
not an expert on bohmian mechanics ab yeah sc people have tried to make it compatible with relativity and 
field theory there have been yeomanlike efforts ab yes sc i think been anything completely convincing ab i think 
if you ask them why the problem is there they will say something like or at least some of 
will say something like quantum field theory actually has its own foundational issues independently of the measurement problem in 
which is true and that makes it very very difficult to come up with a bohmian formulation of quantum 
theory because not clear what quantum field theory you want that can account for all the different phenomena that 
field theory accounts for i quite know what to make of that sc i think a great example of 
nonalgorithmic physics really is ab yes sc not the results you get from physics with the process of doing 
right you have all of these sorts of puzzles things we yet know the answer to and some of 
you have to say worry be figured whereas others you have to say is really important we should really 
on solving and different people are gonna make different choices ab exactly yeah no physics is definitely subject to 
and personality and random fate sc for fifty years the physics as a field made the choice that the 
were not worth worrying about ab exactly and even now say that the standard position is worry about not 
rabid as it was before not worry about worry about sc i think still pretty rabid but we need 
talk too much about everett because my podcast the audience will get plenty of everett over the years but 
he was there at princeton in the early did they overlap everett was a student and bohm was an 
professor ab yes correct they overlap they just missed each other by something like two years so i think 
shows up at princeton as a grad student in i want to say or and bohm is gone by 
end of sc i wonder if all of this work on quantum foundations at princeton in the early ultimately 
einstein certainly influenced bohm he apparently taught a class like a mini lecture ab he gave a lecture that 
was at though everett sc remember chuckle ab yeah he remember later in life on the other hand other 
say that everett was there it makes sense that everett was there and also i know everett was a 
guy ab yeah he was a funny guy ab and people forget things but and ab and there was 
lot of sherry consumed chuckle ab yes there was a lot of alcohol of various kinds absolutely true but 
everett certainly read a great deal of einstein everett also talked with eugene wigner who was someone who was 
princeton at the time who harbored his own kinds of doubts about the copenhagen interpretation and so i think 
was definitely an influence on everett and probably vice versa and yeah einstein was there and the other thing 
princeton at that time was one of the best places to be doing physics in the world sc smart 
would end up there ab exactly yeah and i think that smart people are more likely to question these 
that just been handed on a platter which is not to say that if you question those truths that 
you a smart person laughter sc a lot of physics to get through here so i wanna dwell to 
on everett get there otherwise but bohm suggested an answer to the measurement problem mainly they were hidden variables 
just know their values and so measuring is revealing some truth about nature that we known before and everett 
a completely different one he gives up and so what bohm gives up on is locality in a sense 
allows for spooky action at a distance ab right yeah certainly a little bit more complicated than measurements simply 
things that were already there because measurements can still influence things but a much less mysterious process sc and 
mechanics hearkens back to the classical paradigm where there are definite values of things and we measure them ab 
in some ways sc in some hearkening reaching academics ab yes definitely some hearkening yeah true sc whereas everett 
completely the opposite point of view he says no hidden variables just this wave function we should take it 
not two different ways of evolving only one way of and the price he pays is that when you 
something the universe branches into multiple copies ab yes yeah which is this radical and deeply strange solution to 
problem but again deeply strange is not a strike against things sc exactly and bohm was chased out of 
country and then stabbed in the back ab yes sc everett took his golden parachute he even try to 
a job as a physics professor ab yeah he was certainly not happy with the way that his work 
received mentor and advisor at princeton was the great physicist john wheeler and wheeler was one of most devoted 
and so when he saw work he really liked work at first but he wanted it to get the 
from the master to get the blessing from bohr and bohr sc that was never gonna happen ab yeah 
was never gonna happen bohr and his inner circle never gave it that blessing because of course they and 
whole experience was definitely a traumatizing one for everett but on the other hand everett was never gonna stay 
academia sc my impression ab yeah it where his passions were sc he chased out ab yeah he chased 
if he had wanted to stay he might have had problems i know wheeler was still willing to go 
bat for him but wheeler made everett make a lot of revisions to his ideas in his phd thesis 
try to make bohr happy it work of course and then everett did what he was always going to 
which is he finished his phd and went and got a job working for the military industrial complex doing 
war gaming sc simulations for nuclear bomb falling ab exactly yeah sc so there is this brief moment in 
when a couple of people at princeton thought deeply about the foundations of quantum mechanics and fairly safe to 
that their efforts had zero impact for the next few decades ab have big impacts for a decade or 
yeah true and these are not the only people who thought deeply about the foundations of quantum mechanics just 
ones whose work ended up being the most influential in the coming years but no people there a lot 
widespread open talking about the foundations of quantum mechanics there a lot of research done on it the work 
bohm did and that everett did was probably the most notable work done in the quantum foundations at that 
and then bell shows up bell is one of these people who had never been happy with the story 
been presented with about quantum mechanics and then he got into fights with his college professors about it ab 
then shortly before finishing his university studies in shortly before finishing college and in northern ireland at queens college 
belfast i think the point is at college almost done and then he comes across a book by max 
in which born describes among other things a proof from the great and mighty physicist john von neumann and 
von neumann is one of the giants of century math and physics and so if a proof of something 
john von neumann almost certainly correct and born says that von neumann proved that this way of understanding quantum 
as fundamentally driven by chance that like these weird random chance events that happen when you make measurements is 
only way to think about quantum mechanics sc yeah so it really be deterministic hidden variables ab right exactly 
other way to think about it and so bell is very impressed by this and he wants to go 
at the proof but he because at the time only available in german bell speak german but he thinks 
put this down because von neumann is right and if i keep thinking about this just gonna fall down 
well and never gonna come so he goes off and does some work in accelerator physics and then while 
that job in he sees the papers from david bohm and he reads these papers and he immediately realizes 
wrong with what bohm said bohm may not be right but certainly a perfectly legitimate way of looking at 
mechanics and so then bell realizes von neumann must have been sc can you prove something exist when an 
of it ab right exactly so a counterexample so he again wants to go look at the proof still 
available in german so he goes off and works on other things for a few years he goes to 
school he suggests to his phd advisor that he could either one day give a talk about either work 
the quantum measurement problem or about accelerator physics and his phd never i never pronounce this name rudolph peierls 
yeah who cares ab yeah it matter the point is well known physicist another student of bohr or a 
of bohr student of heisenberg basically gave him a look and said you give a talk about accelerator and 
he just left quantum foundations aside for a while and then finally in the he gets a chance to 
about these things and he sits down and looks at von proof which is finally available in english along 
a couple of other proofs that are related and he said looked at von proof and it fell apart 
my hands not just wrong silly it clearly and so he sc but was it that he he made 
mistake in the proof or just prove the thing that people were ab he prove the thing that people 
he proved sc yeah he proved something else ab and he also prove the thing that he thought proven 
this proof shows up in von textbook quantum mechanics book which is a really incredible intellectual work with this 
flaw in it but in that book von neumann makes it clear that this is how thinking about it 
not correct he proven what he said sc my impression again i forget where maybe from your book that 
who did speak german had seen von book and was at least skeptical of this claimed proof ab you 
i sc and he talked about it to bohm ab yeah there are stories about that and not like 
stories about awareness of von proof are not particularly wellsourced sc okay ab so i put them in my 
because i want to sc yeah exactly good ab yeah and then of course people attacked me for not 
them in my book because no ever happy but the point is yes einstein may have been aware of 
he may not have been aware of it but even if he was aware of it he was skeptical 
it but the point is von proof prove what von neumann and especially a lot of other people thought 
proved and so bell works on it and looks at that proof and these other proofs that are like 
and shows they rule out hidden variables not what they do they do this other sc and grete hermann 
it ab yes right grete hermann a mathematician and philosopher and student of emmy noether pointed out the problem 
von proof just a few years after he published it in and nobody listened to her sc no one 
ab yeah nobody cared yeah a variety of reasons probably including the fact that she was a woman sc 
you go ab but bell independently rediscovers these problems also discovers the problems in similar proofs that have been 
since publishes a paper basically saying these proofs do what you think they do hidden variables are still on 
table they just need to meet these and then at the end of the paper he says there is 
the question about theories hidden variable theories whether they need to be like in that they need to have 
nonlocality an open question which somebody should and so then he starts working on that immediately afterward sc yeah 
conversation ab right and then he answers it and he says this nonlocality a fundamental feature not just of 
variables but of any theory going to reproduce the results of quantum mechanics with the exception of theories that 
something even more sc like many worlds ab like many worlds sc yeah so basically if experiments have definite 
yes if experiments have definite outcomes and not some vast conspiracy going back to the beginning of sc super 
ab yes exactly sc just in case the audience does know the buzzwords let them in on that ab 
exactly so those are pretty much the only two ways out now people are definitely not gonna be happy 
me for saying that but yeah sometimes hear people say you can save locality if you get rid of 
hidden not true because then still left with epr argument sc right ab then hear sc like you already 
theorem in his argument really about hidden variables sc right sc it was about no way to reproduce quantum 
without spooky action at a ab yeah exactly exactly right and hear people say you can save locality if 
give up i have yet to hear a definition of realism that satisfies that unless giving up the idea 
things in which case sure you can have locality sc but people do ab people do but then what 
locality even mean so yeah sc so put ourselves where we are now so like the or most of 
physics community has been ignoring the measurement problem of quantum mechanics it was bohmian effort in the but even 
keep talking about it a lot he did other things i remember this quote from yakir aharonov who was 
of his students and together they invented the aharonovbohm effect which is really really important ab yes it is 
and someone asked him did you ever talk to bohm about his and aharonov says we only ever talked 
ab chuckle i heard that quote but that seems pretty plausible to me yeah he he told me that 
he started working with bohm they had an agreement to not work on that stuff i think in part 
bohm was worried about what impact that would have on career and quite understandable yeah sc and there was 
this infamous memo from the editor of the physical review saying even look at papers in the foundations of 
ab yeah yeah which someone later pointed he said not gonna look at papers in the foundations of quantum 
unless they propose a new experimental result or a new experiment that you can and someone pointed out if 
had that policy thirty years ago that forced you to reject reply to epr ab yeah the sign of 
times though sc exactly no it was really bad so yeah in the we had baumanneverett in the we 
bell paper is published he hear anything about it for years part of this is because this weird story 
where that paper and the other paper he did before that were published which is a whole thing that 
gonna get into but yeah people just paying attention and then at the very end of the bell gets 
about this paper for the very first time from a graduate student named john clauser at columbia university who 
to conduct an experiment to test this particular set of outcomes of quantum mechanics to see if proof holds 
the world because basically what bell showed was can do an experiment and if the experiment if the outcome 
the experiment agrees with quantum mechanics then you have locality and if it and if it agree with quantum 
then you can have locality but also broken quantum which is important sc yeah exactly so the experiment show 
bell was wrong bell gave us horns of a dilemma right ab exactly yes sc either spooky action at 
distance or quantum mechanics is wrong or even worse things like many worlds ab yeah sc so you can 
figure out which one world ab yeah either quantum mechanics is correct in this outcome or we can have 
so you have to actually do that experiment and clauser wanted to do it and so did a couple 
other people and so clauser got together with a guy named abner shimony at boston university and a couple 
other guys named horne and holt and they wrote a paper massaging result into a form that could actually 
tested called the chsh paper after their initials sc this is always an underappreciated part of the process of 
ab yes sc turning the crazy things that the years do into something that can be experimentally probed ab 
at least something that can be computed right sc yeah ab but yeah yeah exactly so they do this 
then in the very early i think or clauser who at this point is a postdoc at berkeley along 
another guy named stuart freedman actually do an experiment to test the predictions of quantum mechanics in this situation 
that they find that quantum mechanics works sc surprise chuckle ab yeah surprise exactly pretty much everybody thought that 
would clauser was not sure clauser really thought that it might turn out the other way and if it 
he would be even more well known than he already is but but no quantum mechanics survived which meant 
we have locality with again sc not in one world overlapping conversation ab yes not in one world yes 
and been that idea of testing these things has been upgraded and carried forward to the present day ab 
sc all sorts of more elaborate tests of inequalities ab exactly yeah so clauser was first and then in 
late this guy named alain aspect did a more detailed experiment testing again the predictions of quantum mechanics in 
conditions and found again that quantum mechanics worked and clauser and aspect really had very different career trajectories from 
point on clauser when he did this he was a postdoc he have a permanent position and he had 
lot of trouble getting a permanent position and ultimately never really did even though done this really impressive experimental 
so his career suffered as a result of doing this work aspect had a permanent position before he did 
work sc wise ab yes and in fact when gone to john bell to talk with him about doing 
work aspect met with bell before setting out on this experimental journey bell even talk to him about it 
aspect assured him that he had a permanent position because bell was so worried about damaging the careers of 
physicists but aspect did this experiment and then went out and gave a lot of talks about it and 
is very good at giving talks sc makes a difference right ab yeah it makes a very big difference 
very good sc niels bohr was very good at convincing people of his point of view and einstein for 
his genius just expected people to go along with him he was not that good at the sales pitches 
no he really he was not a people person yeah and whereas bohr almost had to work with people 
do his work einstein almost never worked with people or he worked with a very small group of people 
he worked with people on the epr paper but then afterward he never talked to podolski again ab yeah 
did not like how that paper turned out and i really think that the clearest versions of the epr 
as einstein thought about it are in later writing where he really explained it much more clearly but yeah 
so aspect was a big force in changing how the field thought about the foundations of quantum mechanics ab 
because he showed he made people aware that there was at least one really nice experiment to be done 
quantum foundations and that in turn caused people take a look at work and then when they did that 
sorts of interesting things happened not only was there renewed interest in quantum foundations but this also drove the 
field of quantum information and quantum computing sc and to be fair i do give people a hard the 
community i give them a hard time for ignoring quantum foundations but there is not only a feeling that 
interesting things to be done but there is a feeling that impossible to make progress on that kind of 
because more a philosophy question no experimental input etcetera etcetera and that is one way of changing that is 
do an experiment that has a big impact on this field ab exactly yeah exactly yeah exactly right i 
as i was saying before if the attitude of the physics community was very hard to make progress and 
not going to work on it because really be one thing that be fine the problem is when you 
that to this normative statement when you say very hard and you work on it a bad idea to 
on it not just because suffer professionally but because not the thing that we do as sc and really 
ab sc so in fact i guess two big things i still have i still wanna ask you about 
sure sc one is despite all the bad mouthing done with the copenhagen interpretation ab yes sc come back 
at least versions of it have come back in the form of these epistemic approaches to quantum mechanics a 
subset of people who really get behind the idea that all supposed to be doing all quantum mechanics purports 
do is to make predictions for experimental outcomes ab well there are definitely people who believe that and there 
definitely people who support these epistemic interpretations epistemic meaning that the wave function is about our knowledge about the 
rather than a thing in the world but i say that the people who support these epistemic interpretations are 
people who say quantum mechanics is really only about the outcomes of experiments and we be doing more than 
as someone we both know matt leifer at chapman university he is certainly a supporter of these epistemic interpretations 
he is a scientific realist he thinks that there is a world and stuff in the world and the 
of physics is to go after that stuff he just thinks that the quantum wave function one of the 
in the world a statement about our knowledge sc right a very good certification yeah so we have this 
wave function the thing that you get away without having in any version of quantum mechanics ab yes and 
think one of the few things everyone would agree on sc there is a wave function ab yes sc 
equation talks about the evolution of something ab yeah but at least there is a quantum state sc a 
state right but amazingly we say in our best understanding of the world whether that thing is real or 
a tool ab yeah sc and so the epistemic folks wanna say just a tool just like a probability 
you say that flipped a coin that i looked at it yet so a chance heads or tails i 
give a probability distribution to that but there is a reality beneath it and they wanna make the wave 
like that ab yeah i think right there are people who think i know there are positions that i 
now getting back to the subject of people being angry with me there are people who hold positions that 
extremely copenhagenlike who will say the wave function is a statement of our knowledge and there a thing underneath 
well and proudly so right there are people who identify themselves as copenhagen supporters not just because nothing better 
because the right answer ab exactly yeah and when you push them on do you mean by you get 
variety of interesting answers and one of the things that happens is you get them jumping between mutually contradictory 
which if you can pull that off is a really effective rhetorical move it turns out that anything follows 
a contradiction so you can always answer any question that been given you just have to contradict yourself sc 
qbism is an example of an epistemic theory ab it is sc do you understand qbism well enough to 
about it for the audience this is capital q capital bism so quantum bism quantum bayesianism ab yeah although 
now say that not what it stands for and not clear what it does stand for just a name 
just a name all by itself ab yeah sc so i think that this is where going to get 
mad at me for my book because i tried to very proeverett promany worlds sc yeah sc i tried 
i said in the book to be fair but not balanced so i certainly gave all of the good 
to everett in quantum mechanics but i tried to say correct things about the other interpretations and qbism or 
approaches more generally are where the chances are greatest that the proponents of those theories will not think being 
i try to be fair but i just figure out what saying ab so speaking of people being mad 
was originally planning to have a chapter in my book about epistemic theories and then my editor started yelling 
me for being way over word count which i was and i ultimately decided is a book about the 
of quantum foundations and how we got from where we were to where we and these epistemic interpretations or 
i call them in my book informationbased interpretations because i try to use less jargon sc no good you 
choice ab yeah i know that they like it but whatever newish right they certainly have copenhagenish dna but 
are mostly things from the and later sc young and being developed we should be fair to them ab 
exactly and so i decided that means that i can get away with not discussing them a great deal 
we seen how gonna play out and if writing a history book that tries to go up to the 
day the hardest part is always gonna be the last fifteen to twenty years sc yeah ab and so 
sc yet decided what history ab yes exactly yeah so i do mention them in my book but i 
into it in a great deal of detail and i talked with matt about this and he said that 
like a perfectly reasonable however some other side epistemic people and some qbists or qbists whatever bad at pronouncing 
are not happy about that and also not happy with how i present bohr in my book and whatever 
i have to say i think that i really understand their position terribly well either and that could be 
but not sure that it is ab i have tried quite a bit to understand it although once i 
that i gonna be going over it in great detail on my book i stopped trying quite as hard 
try as hard ab yeah because i was working on the book but i have since tried some more 
going to have a chance i hope later this year to sit down and talk with david mermin one 
the qbists again but i did talk with him i had two long conversations with him while working on 
book someone i know from when i was in college at cornell and where i went for college and 
aforementioned professor who told gave me the bad news that not a different translation of so yeah david mermin 
a lovely guy he and i disagree about quantum mechanics and not sure that i understand his position i 
not sure what to make of qbism sc okay fine ab yeah sc perfectly fair probably the most prudent 
you can say ab i think right sc yeah ab yeah sc but is it the other big point 
wanted to give us a chance to talk about is the very fact of the existence the resurgence the 
of people trying to make something like copenhagen respectable is it a reflection of the fact that quantum foundations 
broadly are becoming slightly more respectable in physics i mean you still look caltech and harvard and princeton are 
gonna hire physicists who study the foundations of quantum mechanics as senior faculty members but maybe with not only 
experiments in quantum optics and so forth but also interest in quantum computing quantum information become a little bit 
objectionable to worry about the foundations of quantum mechanics ab yeah i mean it definitely has become less objectionable 
with david albert about this things are certainly not the way that they were when he was in graduate 
right when i was an undergrad i was curious about these things and i had some professors saying are 
asking these but there was also david mermin who said ask these and my phd advisor is certainly not 
who spends time thinking about these things even though a very very very good physicist and very smart man 
he mind that i think about these things he just minded if i had spent time doing that rather 
doing my research when i was in graduate school and i do that so yeah i think that part 
it is just people look for new options right people come into a new field or come into a 
resurgent field and want to do something new which is completely understandable i also think some of it comes 
an understanding on the part of people who are sympathetic to the copenhagen interpretation that if they want it 
survive they can no longer ignore the competition so for many many years the strategy was what alternatives right 
are no alternatives sc i did at one point on the colloquium committee at caltech and i suggested getting 
talk on bohmian mechanics and i was swiftly slapped down with a withering gaze if a mixed metaphor that 
can get away with so not quite there yet ab yeah sc situation might be improving a little bit 
yeah yeah i think right i mean on the one hand sure true on the other hand people have 
inviting me to give physics colloquia at some pretty good places like i gave it a colloquium but it 
a public talk sponsored by the harvard physics department invited me back invited me back granted i went to 
of those places michigan for my phd but still those are good schools good physics departments and other departments 
i have no affiliation with have also invited me sc and you did not get tomatoes thrown at you 
i did not get tomatoes thrown at me i thought i was going to get tomatoes thrown at me 
i i gave a talk at berkeley lab which is almost in my backyard and nothing bad happened and 
knew what i was coming to give a talk about made it very very clear in the title in 
i was not saying not a partisan for any particular i was just saying the measurement problem is a 
and an important open problem in physics that mean that everybody has to work on it anymore than than 
has to work on any other open problem we want that but you should be aware that an open 
the same way that aware that we have a theory we have a definite wellaccepted theory of quantum gravity 
a well known open problem even if you work on sc and relatedly maybe in fact part of the 
why people have not been too much in favor of things about quantum foundations is that it has the 
of philosophy about it ab yes sc and for those of us who think an important problem a good 
ab yeah sc been probably that in statistical mechanics arrow of time type stuff the foundations of quantum mechanics 
area in which the philosophers have in some sense carried the torch for a while as physicists have been 
things ab yeah yeah i think right the whole disciplinary split between physics and philosophy is a pretty modern 
we used to call scientists right sc einstein and bohr would not have understood it ab exactly yeah it 
to be that physicists generally had a pretty good schooling in philosophy and certainly have outright contempt for it 
in less than a century got to a point where many well known scientists and physicists do you have 
public contempt for philosophy and i do talk about that a little bit toward the end of my book 
not quite sure why that happens sc heard it suggested that it coincided with the shift in the center 
physics from europe to the united states ab i think that correct and i think that certainly sc americans 
always been more downtoearth practical folk ab yes sc of this abstract nonsense for us gonna build ab that 
absolutely true but also not true that there are no american physicists who have philosophical inclinations there always have 
some right i think a lot of different sociological things that went into it world war ii not only 
the center of physics to the us it also created the era of big science and that certainly had 
to do with it but still puzzled you get physicists saying these things about philosophy and i sure we 
have a deserved reputation for being arrogant when it comes to looking at other fields but i think that 
would get a physicist just saying understand why anybody does i know sheet metal right just seems like a 
thing and anybody who studies best practices in that is just wasting their right know anything about sheet metal 
but i do know that probably good to do it in a way that people get hurt right because 
manufacturing anything people can get hurt why not an experimental sc i think you said i forget whether in 
voice in your book or whether you were quoting someone but there was this wonderful idea that part of 
might have been bell who said of the reason for the rejection of philosophy and foundational questions more generally 
that most physicists think that if they would just spend twenty minutes thinking about it they could figure it 
out they just found the time ab that is indeed bell yes yeah exactly right sc quite incredible ab 
he was a really really good writer and speaker sc well i hope that things are getting better well 
the same side in terms of what would qualify as better but i do think that slowly gradually getting 
your book i think definitely had a salutary effect hopefully mine does ab i hope so too sc and 
forward to whatever book you end up writing next ab thank you yeah so am i sc adam becker 
so much for being on the podcast ab thanks for having me music sounds like people treated fundamental problems 
pimples lot of physicists had this at your age but get over it in re superdeterminism wonder if interested 
conducting an experiment to determine the constants of the linear congruential pseudorandom number generator of the thank you dr 
for your insight relative to the nobel awards or grammies of science and i have offered my thoughts on 
for years please see science fiction fact originally stories of yet my rare insights have been ignored in sweden 
years i am certain some percentage of nobel laureates delivered worthwhile thinking but who can really say lastly for 
neither i nor any in my family have any association with troop college or its successors however we do 
treatment of troop college and university less than admirable sincerely kelvin r troop iii dr comment concerning the nobel 
seems trumpian and illconsidered at best i would hope he would reconsider such statements in the future very glad 
have discovered your podcasts the quantum physicsmechanics episodes have spurred great discussions with my kids thanks for all your 
what i notice the most is the way sean gently leads the conversation along the way if only the 
of our news anchor types were as professional as sean we might have a more reasoned understanding of the 
the guests present i wish sean was heading up the cnnmsnbc talking heads teams good job mate cool adam 
talked with david mermin about qbism and plans have a longer talk with him about the same subject again 
this year thumbs up sean for asking you understand qbism well enough to talk about it for the i 
a bit worried that adam give it a try but i do understand that both fear they might be 
it if they tried to summarize it for a general audience maybe i will give it a try later 
another comment but since david mermin is an excellent teacher it might be best to just ask him how 
thinks one should describe qbism for a general audience so let me repeat my previous suggestion see the episode 
roger penrose how about a conversation with david mermin he managed the incredible feat to be covered on luboš 
in two thousand nine and and being judged favorably both times he also has more conventional achievements like hohenbergkohn 
extension to finite temperature merminwagner theorem merminlindhard dielectric function merminho relation ashcroftmermin solid state physics textbook director of the

arxiv to appear in reports on progress in physics bem sean carroll e adam becker este podcast um dos 
preferidos sean carroll obrigada i think that dennis dieks makes a good case that von proof was not making 
error that bell and others have assumed though mermin disagrees been a while since i reviewed both papers though 
thought dieks made a pretty good case a very important lesson in physics history unfortunately this podcast really got 
down in rambling philosophical musings good philosophy defines the meaning of questions hi sean retrying my question argument against 
approach hi sean here is one argument against quantum manyworld theory every second the universe branches into five thousand 
as you mentioned in one of the podcast and each of those five thousand universes branches into five thousand 
after one more second now consider an eighty year old person he has lived close to seconds which is 
seconds so in his life time universe has branched times which is unfathomably and uncomprehensibly large number so close 
his death he has that many copies of him in different worlds now if you choose randomly a existence 
find himself to be in the era where almost infinite copies of him exist which is close to his 
so everyone person should find himselfherself close to hisher death with almost a probability one infinity we clearly see 
is not the case so manyworld theory can not be true looking forward for your comment on what is 
with this argument thanks sajid comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers science
