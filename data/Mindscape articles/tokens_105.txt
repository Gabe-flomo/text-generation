the first full episode of mindscape an honor to welcome social psychologist carol tavris her book with coauthor eliot 
mistakes were made but not by me explores the effect that cognitive dissonance has on how we think we 
about the fascinating process by which people justify the mistakes that they make and how that leads to everything 
false memories to political polarization carol tavris received her phd in social psychology from the university of michigan she 
the author of numerous books covering topics such as gender biology and emotion and is a frequent contributor to 
variety of newspapers and magazines she is a fellow of the american psychological association the association for psychological science

everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and i have a confession to make namely 
have made mistakes over the course of my career as a scientist and a writer for that matter over 
course of my life as a human being when faced with decisions i have sometimes made the wrong choice 
you have too and happily we have on podcast the perfect person to talk about this idea that people 
mistakes dr carol tavris one of the experts not on making mistakes or the ways that we make mistakes 
on what happens after we make mistakes sc in a masterful book that she wrote with her coauthor elliot 
called mistakes were made but not by me why we justify foolish beliefs bad decisions and hurtful acts dr 
talks about the idea of cognitive dissonance and how we are forced by cognitive dissonance to come up with 
and justifications for the mistakes that we make we might like to imagine that we are perfectly rational reasonable 
but the psychological truth is very much the opposite of that we make up reasons why something was the 
choice after all or why we have had any other option but to make it sc cognitive dissonance theory 
why we do this and in some sense the mother of all cognitive biases it helps us understand why 
the perfect rational reasonable people that we pretend to be and carol tavris is a perfect person to talk 
this with the author of several popular books and also a famous text book on psychology that you might 
used in your intro psych course way back in the day other books include psychobabble and biobunk using psychology 
think critically about issues in the news the mismeasure of woman why women are not the better sex the 
sex or the opposite sex and in september she has a new book coming out called estrogen matters why 
hormones in menopause can improve wellbeing and lengthen their lives without raising the risk of breast cancer now i 
to confess not an expert on either estrogen or menopause or hormones so not what talking about in this 
but then again maybe that is a mistake that making what we will be talking about how we make 
so maybe i should read up on estrogen and hormones then we can bring dr tavris back and have 
conversation about that today going to be talking about cognitive dissonance and why it makes us think that we 
actually really make mistakes so start music sc carol tavris welcome to the mindscape podcast carol tavris very happy 
be talking with you sc so you are a social psychologist right is that the correct descriptor ct it 
sc as opposed to cognitive what are the different kinds of psychologist one could be ct alright hardly anyone 
what a social psychologist is they think a therapist who gives a lot of parties just very sociable chuckle 
you are social ct you are social what it must be social psychology was a field born at the 
of sociology the study of groups and society and the individual and fundamentally it is the study of every 
influence on human beings which is to say everything influences on how we think how we behave influences of 
environment on our behavior influences of our thinking culture the thing interesting about social psychology to me is that 
field that really looks at something that many americans like which is the idea that we really are influenced 
our environments in ways that we realize and really want to realize because after all all individualists we make 
our own mind very independent sc the american dream yeah ct the american dream so i always found social 
wonderfully interesting and rich because no topic it does not cover from love to hate my dear coauthor and 
good friend elliot aronson said that when he was a student he was drawn to social psychology because clinical 
is about repair but social psychology is about change a more optimistic approach to the world because by understanding 
we as individuals and how what is happening in our world influence us we can actually take some steps 
improve things sc but you see patients ct no sc so that would be a clinical psychologist ct that 
be a clinical psychologist the field of psychology we actually speak about the difference between the way clinical psychologists 
trained or i should say psychotherapists are trained and the way psychological scientists are trained this creates what we 
of as the scientistpractitioner gap if you will because many psychotherapists which by the way is an unregulated word 
could put out a shingle tomorrow doing broccoli therapy and it would be completely legal but please do that 
i might do that ct not broccoli not broccoli really so psychotherapy anybody could be anything and call themselves 
psychotherapist clinical psychologists have a phd in that field of clinical psychology and their field is to study psychological 
and problems their training varies from very good scientific training to zero okay so the rest of psychology the 
sciences if you will specify particular areas of study so developmental psychologists study development from the infant to death 
psychologists do what i just described cognitive psychologists study the mind thinking memory and so forth so those are 
specialties within psychological science but most people to this day when they hear they think a therapist sc yeah 
think that a couch in your house in ct absolutely and not just a therapist by the way the 
have been out for decades sc maybe you could bring the couches back ct well there you go sc 
ct your shingle your therapy can have the couch if you want sc right i how about chocolate instead 
broccoli ct sc chocolate therapy couches candles the whole bit ct in our textbook with carole that carole wade 
i did for so many years we actually proposed chocolate immersion therapy as probably the most beneficial thing you 
do sc i like that ct if i so damned ethical i could be really rich sc we all 
that problem exactly and so you have various arrows in your quiver i know written a number of books 
written one of my favorite books of all time mistakes were made but not by me and this is 
the subject of cognitive dissonance so why you tell us a little bit about number one you have a 
who you already mentioned elliot aronson and how the book came to be and what cognitive dissonance is ct 
one sentence or three sc you get all the hours you want ct i have many sentences well so 
guess first i should say what cognitive dissonance is every social psychology student learned this i did when i 
in graduate school a million years ago a simple mechanism but developed over the decades into a really rich 
of understanding why it is that when you tell somebody in a kind and warm and friendly way some 
that shows why they rarely thank you they tell you where you can go with your findings and what 
can do with them and just not inclined to be grateful sc i have no idea what talking about 
experienced this ct i no you never experienced this so you know my friends still say to me to 
day carol so delusionally dear to think that just by explaining to people an important finding you need to 
that they are not always so all that cognitive dissonance really means is that is the uncomfortable feeling we 
when two ideas clash with each other conflict with each other it can be two ideas two beliefs or 
can be more commonly an attitude and a behavior so the classic example is smoking a person who smokes 
that smoking is dangerous and stupid so they will be in a state of dissonance smoke but doing something 
and this discomfort is cognitive dissonance and leon festinger who developed this theory in the late described it as 
as uncomfortable as being hungry or thirsty so uncomfortable that really motivated to reduce it in whatever way you 
well if a smoker you need to quit smoking or you need to justify smoking you need to say 
but be thin and being thin is good and besides that myrtle lived to be sc look ct i 
really so cognitive you know i think i took it terribly seriously i thought it was really an interesting 
but i have much appreciation of its depth of application and then after george bush got us into the 
war elliot and i were sitting around talking sc sorry which george bush and which iraq war are ct 
dubya dubya yeah so this was yeah the so several years later when it was abundantly clear that the 
for going into iraq were completely wrong there were no weapons of mass destruction and so forth and of 
the whole country had noticed that bush did not say we were wrong so sorry we made a really 
mistake about spending a trillion dollars in going into instead he found other justifications for the war bringing democracy 
the and so forth so elliot and i are having this conversation and he said he said disagree with 
democrats who thought that bush was lying to the he said think he was lying to the country i 
he was lying to himself he was doing what all of us do when we have made a decision 
do something is we screen out discrepant dissonant information that suggests our decision is wrong we focus we cherry 
the information that tells us our decision is the right one and we go forth so we make the 
and then we justify ct he said think that george bush had made the decision to go into iraq 
therefore ignored the arguments from his own intelligence community that that might not be a good thing to and 
said i said and from that conversation because that war was so devastating to our country and so palpably 
we thought how do we want to analyze this how do we want to talk about and from that 
came the idea to do a book that would apply the many domains of our lives in which the 
to reduce dissonance gets us into terrible terrible trouble not just politically but in our relationships in our understanding 
memory in therapy in really every aspect of our lives sc right right yeah so one of the maybe 
could do an entire podcast on just this but your book is filled with these wonderful juicy examples of 
being in possession of an idea faced with new information that conflicts with that idea and coming up with 
justification i have many questions but just give the reward to our podcast listeners by telling them some of 
juiciest examples in love in the law like you said politics already doomsday cults is one of the best 
doomsday cults well doomsday yes two filmmakers in england actually made a little film about a doomsday guy who 
the end of the world doomsday is a particularly good story because it was one of the stories that 
leon festinger involved with his whole notion of cognitive dissonance which was this he got involved with a cult 
years ago sc sorry he was the originator of the idea right ct yes leon festinger he was a 
psychologist at stanford sc so what years are we talking here ct in the late late and festinger and 
colleagues infiltrated a doomsday cult in which a woman whom they called marian keech predicted that the world would 
on december of that year and they joined this group and what they found was sc so when they 
the group they were pretending ct pretending to be believers there were several there were many people who believed 
world was going to come to an end now if you believe the world is going to come to 
end you could do one of two things you could sit quietly in your house and wait for the 
to end or you could proselytize you could sell your house and your cow and go off and live 
marian keech go be with her on the night of the great event sc or chocolate immersion therapy ct 
invented yet sc alright okay ct the matter with you sc if you invent a doomsday cult i will 
them ct fine sc therapy ct a lot healthier and safer by the way doomsday cult so they go 
sit with her on the night of december meanwhile her husband slept soundly through the whole night having not 
one single word of this fine at am no sign of any magic spaceship coming to whisk them away 
save them you see they were going to be saved because they understood that the world was coming to 
end no spaceship nothing is happening what to do what to do and finally very late mrs keech has 
vision and the vision is that the world has been saved because of the devout belief of her little 
ct this is a lot better way to reduce dissonance between just made the stupidest mistake i could ever 
made what kind of an idiot am i to have made this this allows you to think of yourself 
a smart kind and wonderful person and have your prediction fail this is the essence of what elliot aronson 
in advancing the theory of dissonance by turning it into a theory of selfjustification two ideas can be dissonant 
like woody allen films and your friend like woody allen films and so you might try to decide your 
okay to be stupid about woody allen films or whatever it might be ct but the dissonance that most 
is when information about a belief or something that done directly causes us to question our selfconcept something about 
that we feel is really important about ourselves if you criticize something about me that i consider important or 
think good at well so what sc you can deal with that ct but if you show me how 
have not been skeptical about something i really should have been skeptical about i have let gullibility take over 
to be really embarrassed and going to try to reduce that dissonance either by defending myself and by dismissing 
evidence that been a gullible fool so why so important to understand how dissonance works because when the selfconcept 
threatened a good worthy smart person and now telling me done something bad cruel harmful and wrong well piss 
and take your information with you ct to me one of the most important findings of this theory is 
it explains why people who are good compassionate caring people will often find themselves continuing practices that are wrong 
and outdated precisely because they see themselves as good kind compassionate people a doctor telling me that this thing 
doing in my practice for twenty years is harming my patients the hell it is a good competent doctor 
going to keep doing this sc and you give examples for example of in the legal system people being 
guilty by prosecutors but then obviously exculpatory evidence comes along clearly mistakes have been made and yet the people 
did the prosecutions or the detectives who arrested the person in the first place see it that way ct 
do not because the good guys by definition prosecutors and police are the good guys the ones in the 
hats and those bad people are bad now telling me that i a good person put another good person 
prison well not even possible therefore okay if he commit this particular crime he certainly committed other crimes and 
not doing anything wrong that truly is their reasoning the inability of course there are many venal reasons that 
might not admit mistakes not what talking about people will fail to admit a mistake because they want to 
fired they want to be fined they want to go to prison those are obvious reasons that people lie 
explains why we lie to ourselves why so pernicious and so dangerous and so important to understand sc and 
done politics and the law and doomsday cults love lives marriages ct oh love lives sc has it ever 
that we are dissonant in a ct oh i want to no of course not okay one more thing 
the law though because this is so important throughout the legal system and in the military once people believe 
they are interrogating a guilty person nothing that person does or says will disconfirm their belief this is true 
the psychotherapists and social workers who believed that they could tell if a child had been sexually abused say 
the child admitted it well the child had been abused but if the child denied it well the child 
in denial so there was no if you are convinced that you know what has really happened in a 
with a child or a suspect or a convict or anybody everything that person does will confirm your belief 
make your belief consonant with what doing the way that many police officers or even trained detectives are trained 
interviewing is if a suspect seems nervous a sign of guilt what if a sign of nervousness because just 
arrested and innocent sc yeah there might be alternative explanations ct exactly which they are not trained to think 
right sc and that parallels what do you said about george w and the iraq war and but clearly 
just high stakes courtroom dramas in our everyday lives in our personal lives and marriages this is going to 
something where our partner accuses us of a certain kind of behavior maybe a twinge of truth to that 
and able to justify it somehow ct yes we are we yes laughter yes indeed well elliot puts it 
way he said how it he said fall in love and the person is the most wonderful person this 
is just adorable everything about this person is a lovable thing you are in a state of blissful consonance 
everything this person does conforms to what you think the ideal partner should be then a tiny blip occurs 
the landscape of wait did i just mix a metaphor sc a yeah blips on landscape okay go with 
ct crabgrass in the lawn of life whatever it might be and your beloved turns out to have a 
that you really like so much you like getting to places twenty minutes early and your beloved likes to 
there two days late right okay now at first what people do is just dismiss this dissonant information about 
perfection of the beloved and say really not important and most of the time not but what happens next 
going to be key for how couples maintain their relationship in the sense that all of us do things 
the other person is annoyed by or agree with and then the question is whether you come to see 
things as behaviors that are too dissonant to live with or whether you reduce dissonance by saying know what 
person is so wonderful in so many other ways that this particular problem is trivial and i can live 
ct but those are the negotiations we do all through our lives you can see what happens when people 
made the decision to divorce is that suddenly they have a little memory surgery and immediately forget everything they 
once loved about the person and now everything about the person is demonic terrible and wrong and always knew 
ever that this person was the worst possible well no you sc a switch flips right ct a switch 
and the switch flips because now you are seeking to be consonant in your view that this person is 
damn terrible to live with any further and so everything then gets rewritten to conform to the new story 
in my book the big picture i talk about similar ideas because trying to talk about some kind of 
in view of the world so i introduced the idea of a planet of belief that you have a 
of beliefs that are kind of like rocks or asteroids that come together under a mutual gravitational pull because 
seem to fit together and you you develop a coherent view of how to look at the world and 
is your planet of belief and these planets develop their defense mechanisms right if something comes along a stray 
from outer space that threatens to undermine the integrity of the planet you try to blast it out of 
right you try to fit it in necessarily and very interesting ct cosmological dissonance here what this is yes 
i think so yes cosmological dissonance right very interesting you might say given these examples people just change their 
ct right sc is it just a matter of too much work like they get a new world is 
all about status and their selfimage or does it go deeper than that ct well both of those things 
depends what the world view is about in particular and how important it is to you whether this is 
a world view that governs how you see the world and how you behave in that world and we 
have our narratives as the trendy word now is our stories that govern our lives as george gerbner once 
the only species that tells stories and lives by the stories we really the key thing so for example 
can see this with memories everybody comes up with the story of their lives i was raised this way 
is the kind of person i am this is what happened to me that has made me what i 
today that story is often a very powerful one because it explains to us who we are so now 
come along and say to you know what that memory you have of what your father did to you 
you were seven turns out that happen at all that and jarring jarring to learn that a memory you 
that seems to fit the story you tell about your life so why we get so upset to learn 
our memories are fallible and are wrong ct so as i said earlier in view about the dissonance that 
the most is the dissonance that most blows up the planet if you will that most questions something lived 
whether religion or atheism or a life story a belief about why we are the way we are and 
where not just changing one idea but where one idea is going to pull out a thread going to 
the whole thing sc so these ideas of cognitive dissonance slightly different but clearly related to cognitive biases that 
have the little bugs in our reasoning capacities that motivate us to think one way or the other motivated 
my brain is not giving me any cognitive bias even off the top of my head confirmation bias things 
that ct well the key well cognitive dissonance is based and i want to say that this is a 
of mental functioning that has more than experiments supporting it in every aspect of social and cognitive psychology it 
a lot of evidence underlying it and one reason is that the component cognitive biases really are subsumed under 
in a way that is cognitive dissonance rests on a number of particular biases one is the confirmation bias 
we might call the consonance bias going to look for information that confirms what i believe and will keep 
in a state of consonance and going to dismiss and throw out and tell you a jerk if you 
me evidence dissonant right so the confirmation bias is key to how we keep our thoughts consonant the bias 
not biased that is a very good bias i really love that bias lee bias sc i have that 
completely unbiased about that ct completely unbiased about that i think it is the cutest bias ever but you 
think how it plays out you and i are having an argument i am an unbiased person therefore if 
can just sit here and tell you why wrong and right you will understand that you are wrong and 
am right and that will be fine because you are biased and not and have a lovely conversation sc 
only i understood that progress would be made ct there you go and the fact that you do not 
what i have told you and instead have your own beliefs oh unthinkable that means biased and not i 
a central filter of how we get through our days and it is the reason that quarrels and arguments 
only continue but escalate because the determination to show that other person why wrong why wrong and not continues 
many of the information biases that govern us in a way can be subsumed under this overarching need to 
consonant to keep our beliefs uniform and motivating motivated reasoning is exactly the more recent term for this as 
says every few years somebody renames dissonance theory something else so that they can get their publication and to 
why not cognitive dissonance at all well the same thing sc so in some sense this rather be coherent 
right how our brains work anyway you say that out loud but sort of under the hood this is 
machinery working to make everything smooth out remove the conflicts wherever we can ct yes and we would add 
that is evolutionarily speaking a very adaptive strategy you want to keep changing your mind four times before breakfast 
want to sit there saying should i brush my although then you read a study of flossing and you 
being silly but if we had to change our minds with everything that came along every day we get 
done and so we choose what kind of package of beliefs we want to hold and for the most 
spend our energy following those than investigating every new thing that might cause us to change sc presumably there 
an evolutionary pressure to be correct about the world also but clearly a tradeoff right somehow whether there might 
some physics explanation for this not sure some bayesian reasoning some efficiency some thermodynamics explanation but coherence like you 
somehow the coherence of the world view has been so important as gone through the generations that that is 
utmost when we try to make sense of the world ct well right and of course so many of 
things that evolved to suit us when we lived in tribes little bands were effective ways of keeping us 
to and connected to our tribe mates and of course the corollary of that is that anyone who is 
in our tribe was an enemy who had to be stomped out immediately and their beliefs are definitely wrong 
so happy we evolved past that ct yes indeed so those were adaptive strategies for thinking and behaving but 
always serve us well today sc and pointed out that almost an inverse correlation in our ability to deal 
these cognitive biases with how smart somebody is their intelligence or their level of self esteem the better you 
at reasoning the better it turns out you are at reconciling these dissonances in a way that change your 
in some sense ct oh not reconciling dissonances better at justifying sc justifying ct justifying yourself yeah yeah exactly 
most skeptical skeptics sc the firmest entrenchment ct who tell me been or the people who think of themselves 
being most competent in a particular sphere who are going to resist being told they put an innocent guy 
prison or just killed a patient and so forth of course i want to make it clear there are 
many exceptions of people who really want to improve how they do their jobs and how they live in 
world but they are not generally the majority ct i would like to mention because i find so many 
have found this metaphor to be really helpful in their lives so mention it now we call it in 
book pyramid of and as i say been very touching to me to people have written and said know 
really works for it started because somebody did a study a long time ago of schoolchildren they were kids 
the question is your view of ct so imagine a pyramid or a triangle if twodimensional at the top 
this pyramid and your you and your pal have the same views of cheating you think a great thing 
do but not the worst crime in the world okay neutral about cheating now taking a test really an 
test the final exam your grade is going to depend on this exam we all know how students are 
pass this everything will go south my cat will leave sc seen this in action ct seen this in 
world my will but you freeze on a crucial question you do not know how to answer this question 
grade is going going to fail this is horrible and suddenly the student next to you makes her answer 
clear and so you have it in one second cheat or cheat so in this study some of the 
were given a situation in which they were able to cheat and some not so forth and what they 
the second you make that decision even impulsively you cheat you cheat because the grade is really important you 
because your integrity is more important ct now the minute you make that decision you must make your behavior 
your belief about cheating consonant so if you cheat your attitude will now shift to be is really not 
a bad thing everybody cheats not important and never cheat if you resist the impulse to cheat you say 
minute cheating is not a victimless crime we all suffer from it a terrible thing cheaters are ct so 
our metaphor of this pyramid you make that first step down the pyramid you cheat or you cheat over 
what happens is you become more and more entrenched in your view of cheating as a good thing or 
bad thing until over time you are both at the bottom of this pyramid standing far apart from each 
in your views about cheating the one who cheated will think completely trivial and not important at all and 
one who resisted will want to hang you by your ankles outside the school door sc having started with 
the same belief system ct having exactly and really interesting about this when you visualize it you can see 
difficult it is to go back up and say a minute i was wrong to and there are many 
for this the slippery slope and so forth but by seeing it in a dissonance way in a selfjustification 
you can see how hard it becomes to go back and say know that little jump that little random 
i did has led me far from what my original views of cheating so that metaphor applies to so 
decisions that we make in our everyday lives from an impulsive decision accused of rape or accused of some 
horrible act and what do we do as citizens reading the newspaper or did i just say reading the 
please forgive me so sorry sc your age is showing i want to say anything ct oh god want 
say anything right sc reading the website ct what is a newspaper okay but we sc you mean listening 
the podcast ct listening to the podcast we all make impulsive decisions that guilty or that innocent and then 
want to hear we want to wait for god forbid evidence oh please suggesting that right or wrong and 
we see these in world where everybody instantly jumps to an opinion about everything without necessarily waiting for evidence 
further information and how quickly you can get enmeshed in justifying that initial jump off the pyramid and when 
turn out to be wrong not so easy to say sc i love the pyramid of choice i think 
the crowd who once you explained it to me was like my goodness that just explains so many ct 
faculty at duke university when that lacrosse team was accused of raping the stripper that hired and so forth 
the faculty eighty members of the faculty took out a fullpage ad saying the culture the rape culture of 
athletic teams and so forth is disgraceful duhduhduhduhduh in other words assuming that the allegations against the team were 
and when they turned out not to be and when sc they were false yeah ct yeah they were 
and when the district attorney was disbarred for not sharing appropriate information with the defense was there a letter 
the faculty saying we made a mistake we have been so quick to judgment maybe we should have waited 
the sc there been that many letters like that in human history ct not so many no sc this 
a related to what sure is a cognitive bias not seen it talked about in psychology or whatever but 
dealing with probabilities human beings are very bad at estimating probabilities but also very bad at accepting that probabilities 
from zero to i think that when faced with something that might happen and not sure going to happen 
seems to me people will only really deeply accept three possibilities that the chance of this thing happening is 
not going to happen that a definitely going to happen or that that we have no idea whether it 
happen or not sc the idea that and that sometimes the thing happens i think that nate silver got 
a lot of flack after donald trump got elected because he gave something like a chance that hillary clinton 
get elected and afterward he was like wrong things happen all the but we have this inability i think 
correctly judge probabilities that are not or one or zero does that make sense ct absolutely well and completely 
and of course as we know when people make decisions medical decisions do i want this treatment it has 
chance of success and a chance of failure i mean we are asked to make medical decisions often on 
basis of likelihoods and risks and very hard very often to make those decisions or we look at the 
of something happening rather than the chances of it not happening sc yep chuckle ct so a difficult skill 
acquire but truly an important one sc a lot of poker players have become very wealthy off of inability 
correctly judge these probabilities and probably also the the pyramid of choice also feeds into the idea of not 
how we justify our own beliefs but how we view others this goes back to the couples divorcing you 
in love with this person at one point now you decide you want to be with them anymore and 
satan and talking to other people about them afterward must lead these people to say why were you ever 
love with this but it helped but you change how you view the other because not on their side 
right well what you say we have this guy in our book who is a friend of who having 
his wife of thirtyseven years said to her said to her never really loved well really no for the 
thirtyfive years he did right sc so i just found online this thing has just been going around how 
and republicans view each other so not how they view themselves but how they actually i think the study 
ask how they viewed themselves but who cares about that those are more or less accurate but they ask 
they asked republicans what percentage of democrats are agnostics or atheists the correct answer is about and the answer 
by republicans was ct oh sc yeah some reasonability there the one i liked was how many democrats are 
or lesbian laughter and the average republican thinks over a third of democrats are gays or lesbians and the 
answer is closer to and the same thing for blacks and union members but to be very very honest 
bad ideas about democrats were less crazy than bad ideas about republicans so how many republicans are sixtyfive or 
democrats thought it was of republicans are over the age of which even a small amount of thinking laughter 
the numbers really work out that way closer to sc and my favorite how many republicans they also thought 
tended to be evangelical southerners but they also thought the republicans earned over two hundred fifty thousand dollars a 
the average democrat thinks that of republicans earn more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year and the 
number is not and partly misinformation but it has to be partly part of the cognitive dissonance story we 
a caricaturing story of the people we disagree with that makes us look better not sure ct yes well 
i mean packed a lot into that those answers stem from stereotypes that we have of another group a 
that we know much about i remember reading a story about some new yorker who had moved to idaho 
everybody in idaho thought he well you can imagine what they thought of him sort of a crazy liberal 
communist pinko gay guy i know but the people in idaho had no experience with new yorkers they knew 
about new yorkers and he goes to idaho with plenty of assumptions and expectations about people in idaho all 
idiots or whatever the hell he thought they were and what happens when you have people living in the 
community who have different opinions is that you see diversity in attitudes and behavior amongst them my good friend 
coauthor carole wade who lives in northern california in a very guntoting conservative area but she said disagree politically 
we see each other as the real human beings that they are i see republicans i disagree with but 
are caring members of their community and they are active in feeding the poor and the hungry and they 
stop by the side of the road if you were in any kind of trouble to help ct and 
not stereotype thinking so asking questions like this of democrats and republicans is asking about a stereotype or something 
that group that you like rich gay crazy whatever it might be sc i was just amused that democrats 
that so many republicans were at once really rich and also evangelical southerners quite sure this is all put 
ct logic and coherence do not enter into stereotyping you should know that by now sc but yeah and 
think that maybe does this help also i even want to open the box but social media and how 
things are and how we respond viscerally and badly to the slightest amount of disagreement online because we appreciate 
humanity of the people behind the words not a facetoface conversation all seeing is this one little snippet of 
or opinion and you can react instantly and badly to it in a kind of safe way ct nobody 
to let alone the first book i wrote anger the misunderstood emotion a very long time ago was an 
in part of the catharsis hypothesis the idea that really good and healthy to express your anger when you 
angry and it will reduce your heart rate then it prevent you from getting ulcers and all kinds of 
good things wrong this was my first experience with explaining kindly to people why these clinical assumptions and freudian 
about catharsis not only were wrong but harmful because the more people express anger the angrier they get generally 
and it calm you down it riles you up and so forth and in that sc and everyone instantly 
because you had evidence ct yes i had wonderfully interesting evidence and of course as you can see thanks 
the diminution of anger in our society that sc that was your fault thanks good ct so no they 
me what i could do with my ideas about catharsis one guy wrote to me and said my wife 
the car i want to yell at her i want to yell at her i want her to feel 
worse than she sc ct really sc obviously the right strategy is to yell at somebody ct oh please 
one researcher had identified the conditions under which the expression of anger is likely to be cathartic that is 
make you feel good the conditions okay the first is no retaliation from the target so you say to 
sweetie sc i agree with that one ct are a and the target says right i really am a 
if no retaliation good you are anonymous so the target respond to you your anger is proportional to the 
so if somebody does something trivial and you hit them with a howitzer going to be embarrassed sort of 
but if you feel your response is the appropriate righteous thing going to feel good ct so the gist 
these conditions all of which are met by the internet you get to just rant immediately you get to 
somebody you get to be selfrighteously satisfied showed that person and once again people just failed to take my 
about this i remember writing a letter to a columnist russell baker who was a funny guy and he 
something that i disliked about the movement i even remember what it was and i wrote him an angry 
i was terrific let me tell you i was funny and smart and stupid because you know how you 
when writing something in anger ct so i sent him this letter and he sent it back to me 
he had written in the margins and commented and basically of course i get this thing back and i 
how really rude been and how i was not going to persuade him of anything in my rudeness and 
then i replied sorry this is not what i meant to say try i sent him that one and 
wrote back and said think this could be the beginning of a lovely and civilized it was a great 
for me because with anger two reasons to be enraged one is you want to punish the other person 
the other is like to change the other person or fix the problem between you and a lot of 
confuse those motives i think sc and this brings us to the question of what could we learn from 
dissonance theory about how to actually change minds if that were to be our goal i think as implying 
not our goal sometimes we just want to let loose a little bit right and maybe we should squelch 
impulse but sometimes we want to reach people knowing that people are defensive about their existing views and knowing 
they want to justify themselves does that give us a clue as to how to be better persuaders ct 
gives us a very important clue one not always successful of course we can do better with our own 
perhaps than trying to change the other guys but the rule the guiding rule number one is do not 
the other person feel stupid for what they believe and this is of course what people do the matter 
you what were you thinking when you did that how can you spend five thousand dollars on magazine subscriptions 
know what are you an well what is the person going to say you have now exquisitely put them 
a terrible state of dissonance between a smart person i spent this money on magazine subscriptions because hoping win 
lottery and my children will have money forever my motive was a good ct so when you make people 
stupid for believing what they believe you guarantee that they will hold on to that belief even more strongly 
guaranteed it so instead you look to understand or talk to the person about why they believe what they 
what that belief serves for them how it helps them whether they themselves see any problems with it whether 
see a better way of getting what it is they want so that you make it an adversarial right 
wrong because that going to go nowhere for sc anthony penn who is another podcast guest talks about giving 
a soft landing he talks about why certain communities have different beliefs that they do and he says all 
them is that idiots and that irrational and they understand reason and evidence and no one has ever been 
persuaded by ct exactly right put it exactly in dissonance terms if going to make me feel stupid out 
here and by the way it may be that the accuser we the smart questioner really understand what that 
is serving for the other person what they gain by believing as they do how it comforts them how 
by it how much investment of time and emotional energy put into that belief one of classic experiments severity 
initiation on liking for the group a famous funny study but basically what he found is that the more 
and pain and effort you put into joining a group the more going to like that group even if 
turns out to be really a stupid and uninteresting group so all of us have beliefs that we have 
a lot of time and sometimes pain as well in investing ct i think for ourselves in understanding dissonance 
story we tell in our book which i just love because i think such a good guideline for us 
this is a true story when ronald reagan went to bitburg germany to lay a wreath there at the 
where it turned out that fortyseven nazi officers had been buried there was an enormous protest over this going 
this cemetery and honoring these nazi war dead and good friend shimon peres then prime minister of israel was 
course particularly outraged so were many others around the world but reagan back down ct so someone asked peres 
you feel about the fact that your good friend ronald reagan went to bitburg to do this and peres 
a friend makes a mistake the friend remains a friend and the mistake remains a that is the goal 
how we ought to think about cognitive dissonance because the usual impulse friend has made a mistake is to 
the friend or minimize the mistake you can see this in news reports all the time somebody we really 
as a fabulous person has been convicted of some crime or accused of something and people know which way 
go sc i know that guy been so sweet sound like him at all ct exactly or the mistake 
what he did oh just trivial sc a misunderstanding ct fortythree children really ct so the usual thing that 
do and we usually do that unconsciously we make those reductions of dissonance under the radar to allow ourselves 
feel comfortable because living with dissonance is painful i want to go back to that point really uncomfortable sarah 
has a fantastic threeminute video that she did when her good close friend louis ck was discovered to have 
committing these awful sexual acts and her video is a perfect statement of a person in dissonance she says 
did was wrong it disgusts me and i hate it but been my very good friend for many years 
know what a great humanitarian he is what a great father he is what a great friend so able 
separate these two things and she said know how going to resolve but the struggle worth doing rather than 
him under the bus or minimizing his actions harder harder sc it seems to me like empathy is important 
i know paul bloom the psychologist who hoping to get as a future podcast guest he wrote a book 
had a brilliant idea write a book called against empathy empathy is bad and very very roughly speaking his 
is that having empathy tends to be something that we do for people who are like us and therefore 
much empathy pushes us away from the direction of reason and rationality and thoughtfulness because it just makes us 
identify with other people but it sounds like if really trying to understand people who seem to be doing 
we understand ourselves putting ourselves in their place understanding where they came from like you said understanding the reasons 
those beliefs are so valuable to them would be useful to us ct well it the question is the 
of understanding you know that the french say understand all is to forgive no it sc no ct to 
all is to understand all period all it is and then once you understand then you can decide i 
to forgive is this important to forgive does my understanding give me greater compassion for why this person has 
as they have and make me more forgiving of it or a separate question and a moral issue a 
choice for each of us but we all live by the attributions we make of other behavior this is 
big part of social psychology which is how the explanations we make of why people do what they do 
everything so if you think your beloved has been rude to you or thoughtless because your beloved has had 
horrible day at work and in los angeles a commute home okay be more forgiving than if your attribution 
to their personality just the way they are sc and even talking to people in public if we want 
say person disagrees with me is it because they have a principled objection to what saying or just because 
have bad motives and are not acting in good faith and clearly understand the force of my ct exactly 
why the goal really of what it means to be openminded is to make ourselves open to other points 
view without the dissonance reduction reaction is that other point of view out of here i want it in 
but when you can if you have to make important decisions if you can surround yourself with people who 
who just going to agree with you but who might show you where you might be wrong extremely useful 
and then we have the idea of persuading others we also have the idea of fixing ourselves right been 
the crowd when given talks to audiences at tam for example and amazing you explain how cognitive dissonance makes 
justify their mistakes and things like that and everyone in the audience is going the people i disagree with 
justify the mistakes that right ct yeah they do sc and almost no one says i am justifying my 
is there a tool kit or a checklist or some set of strategies we can have to notice when 
this when doing this selfjustifying behavior ct sure you notice that justifying your behavior a really simple sc so 
i ct well sc but so good right at coming up with the excuse so when is it an 
and when is it just a correct rational reconstruction of why thinking in such a way ct oh well 
very fine question one of the things been interesting to read the amazon reviews of our book is how 
people say i started out reading this book and i was explains all my then halfway through this explains 
government and then at the end it explains ct i see science in general as a form of arrogance 
in the sense that one of the most organized methods we have of forcing us to put our beliefs 
the test and forcing us to face dissonance if the test does not confirm what we believe the method 
have set up to test our beliefs and you have to do a scientific experiment to do that to 
some belief that you hold and say really what is the evidence for this is is the evidence changing 
i once thought to be i look back on my writing in social psychology and interesting to me how 
ideas have changed irritatingly because the evidence has changed or has become more persuasive sc i do i personally 
that acting as an informal scientist is a good way to correct yourself against some of these biases like 
say much of the scientific method informal and crazy and nonsystematic as it is is about putting off the 
that we will fool ourselves one way or the other always very amused as a cosmologist as a physicist 
i say something about the big bang or einstein or relativity some fraction of people out there in the 
who will say just defending the establishment views of the and i want to say of my incentives are 
the other like become a famous physicist by saying that einstein was sc everyone knows einstein was right the 
point the whole incentive structure in science is to say great people of the past were wrong and we 
do better than and a wonderful sort of selfcorrective to try to do now on the other hand at 
same time i realize telling a flattering story about myself because saying that scientists are the best at correcting 
false impressions they have their scientific training in them ct well no scientists are human like everybody else i 
is that true i mean you guys sc very flawed human beings most of us ct very flawed laughter 
a couple of outliers but yes ct well so even scientists are not always happy that the when results 
out the way they would like them to i mean we say i guess i do that study well 
better redo that another fortyfive times it comes out the ideal scientist we might all aspire to but everybody 
the feeling of thinking can i redo this so it will come out the way i want it to 
sc yeah and certainly empirically a million examples of people doing exactly that right ct oh yeah yeah yeah 
indeed science is selfcorrecting or at least it moves forward in certain lurching ways sc fits and starts ct 
fits and starts and right people do have an incentive to find something new and different to say in 
field always so interesting to me that all the studies that show that similarities between women and men and 
traits or abilities and skills and stuff those never get published the differences that are sexy we want to 
what differences there are and the news that there differences news and it interesting but the goal is to 
free enough to investigate questions wherever they might lead and one of the problems of course facing in our 
society is that getting harder for people to do that to question received wisdom certainly in the social sciences 
my god to ask provocative questions to be a naysayer sc right you mentioned the brain been talking ct 
i mention the brain oh sc i think you mentioned the brain i think you just did maybe i 
it onto you i know been talking in psychological terms of course a sexy thing going on right now 
is the neuroscientific way of talking about these things actually looking in the brain not just talking to the 
but doing fmri or meg studies of going on inside their head do these concepts of dissonance and justification 
on to parts of the brain is that something that we aspire to or we can say now or 
just crazy ct yes and no yes a number of researchers have tracked cognitive dissonance into the brain they 
out which parts of the brain sc lighting up ct lighting up i love that language lighting up an 
light up but okay when the brain is in a state of dissonance one of the cutest experiments was 
have democrats and republicans process information about their favorite political candidate positive information about their favorite candidate positive information 
the opponent oh dissonant sc bad ct bad information about your guy and when they were in a state 
dissonance guy did something bad the other guy did something you could see it in their brains and he 
said it was like when consonance was restored it was like twirling a mental kaleidoscope to get the pieces 
fit right people really were happy when the pieces fit right that said i know what learned from this 
we know otherwise and very interested in brain research of course but also written about pseudoneuroscience which is the 
that if we just have a brain in there really doing science and very often a lot of those 
are just got a scanner and going to do i what i can with it sc i love the 
ct there you go sc the temptation to find things going on in the fmri image ct absolutely sc 
saying yes there it ct there it is sc the part of the brain that likes rutabagas right ct 
what do you know now that you know before sc now of course neuroscience is very important but also 
to do right and maybe a little bit easy to over claim what getting ct oh yes of course 
is of course it is and really like all new technologies give a boy a hammer and everything needs 
give researchers a scanner and everything needs scanning but what am i looking for sc and very early days 
pregalileo trying to collect data understand the brain is way more complicated than the solar system ever was ct 
there you are absolutely sc but you also mentioned or talked about the idea of memories and how memories 
accurate and this is something that i first came to from neuroscience from studies actually from i was studying 
arrow of time the difference between the past and the future and there were these wonderful studies and i 
to be able to judge the scientific credibility of various neuroscience studies maybe it is neurobollocks but what the 
said that if you put someone in an fmri machine so basically taking pictures of where the blood is 
around in their brain and you ask them to imagine a past experience remember what it was like at 
birthday last year where you were having dinner whatever certain parts of the brain light up in excitement turning 
memory remembering this scene and then you ask them to imagine a future scene imagine what your next birthday 
be like and somewhere else and so forth the claim was exactly the same parts of the brain that 
doing the same thing sc of course doing something different but evolution is sort of cheap evolution reuses things 
are already there maybe the hypothesis goes the way that we learned to imagine the future is by taking 
of the fact that we had a part of the brain that could remember the past and just putting 
to use again and the idea being that the memory of the past is not a videotape not a 
that is stored as a jpeg file or an mpeg file somewhere more like a screenplay and when we 
the past we download the screenplay and put the play on again just like we do when we remember 
future when we imagine the future ct no no more sc no ct more like cells of a film 
you have a couple of those cells of a film and you are interpolating the connecting elements in a 
of film in a filmstrip which i mean to interrupt you but i would say something a little different 
is when asking them to remember a past a childhood birthday or imagine a future one imagining both of 
things sc right ct you know that the recall of the birthdays is accurate what asking for is me 
story about what that birthday is that you think you not actively or accurately retrieving every detail about that 
birthday party you have a few details about it seen pictures of it your mother has told you what 
color of the cake was or whatever it might be mostly seen pictures of it and heard stories about 
and so made up a little memory of your fifth birthday party that may or may not be true 
by the way every time you talk about your fifth birthday party going to embellish it and with every 
your memory of it will change sc and you reinforce things that might not have been there ct you 
the newer story yes exactly why so dissonant for people to accept the evidence that memory is fallible in 
ways and we keep our memories consonant with whom we think we are now my i had an older 
brother who had a terrible stepfather who was really pretty mean to him and memory of his stepfather was 
mean his stepfather was to him all the time and he could tell you these stories but years later 
he confronted his stepfather about the stepfather was a disciplinarian and cold the stepfather said you were a difficult 
you listen you want to talk to me about reasons for things i had to be a strict disciplinarian 
you because otherwise go head first out the window and get into more my brother had written out of 
memories his own part in the story and a common thing that we do so in that way he 
a story about how his stepfather was mean to him and made him do this that and the other 
so past and future is a lovely arrow but what we know about memory well with all the research 
how unreliable memory is i think important to say also pretty damn good too sc pretty damn good right 
ct overall overall glad i have one sc not completely random ct losing it rapidly and so glad what 
happy for it but that is a hard thing for us i think to understand that more efficient for 
brain to jettison elements of an event or a memory that we really need to have and to give 
the gist the centerpiece of it but also what allows us to rethink events that happened and to reconsider 
causes or other things that were happening at the time sc and it was interesting to me to realize 
utterly false memories can be just as vivid and just as absolutely convincing to the rememberer as accurate ones 
i ct oh people hate that people hate that sc right but wrong to have the metaphor in your 
of a photograph that is aging and getting blurred out over time you could have a very crisp very 
very believable memory that is false ct exactly sc and so the brain is doing something crazy there not 
what i mean not the jpeg image in your brain somehow sharpening up and as we said telling the 
over and over again i think this is going to be part of my chocolate immersion therapy laughter that 
yourself a story you want to hear just keep repeating it tell yourself this version of the conversation you 
had in which you come out victorious pretty soon forget it the version that actually happened i think very 
therapy ct i think a very effective therapy the french have an expression de the wit of the staircase 
is the witty deft retort that you think of making as leaving the party and walking downstairs going to 
that memory to be it something you said at the time sc i live in fear of this and 
live in fear that going to be regretful that i ask you a whole bunch of more questions but 
tavris thank you very much for being on this podcast ct been a pleasure thanks sean music for the 
full episode of mindscape an honor to welcome social psychologist carol tavris her book with coauthor eliot aronson mistakes 
made but not by me explores the effect that cognitive dissonance has on how we think we talk about 
fascinating process by which people justify the mistakes that they make and how that leads to everything from false 
to political polarization carol tavris received her phd in social psychology from the university of michigan she is the 
of numerous books covering topics such as gender biology and emotion and is a frequent contributor to a variety 
newspapers and magazines she is a fellow of the american psychological association the association for psychological science and the

carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and i have a confession to 
namely i have made mistakes over the course of my career as a scientist and a writer for that 
over the course of my life as a human being when faced with decisions i have sometimes made the 
choice maybe you have too and happily we have on podcast the perfect person to talk about this idea 
people make mistakes dr carol tavris one of the experts not on making mistakes or the ways that we 
mistakes but on what happens after we make mistakes sc in a masterful book that she wrote with her 
elliot aronson called mistakes were made but not by me why we justify foolish beliefs bad decisions and hurtful 
dr tavris talks about the idea of cognitive dissonance and how we are forced by cognitive dissonance to come 
with excuses and justifications for the mistakes that we make we might like to imagine that we are perfectly 
reasonable beings but the psychological truth is very much the opposite of that we make up reasons why something 
the right choice after all or why we have had any other option but to make it sc cognitive 
theory explains why we do this and in some sense the mother of all cognitive biases it helps us 
why not the perfect rational reasonable people that we pretend to be and carol tavris is a perfect person 
talk about this with the author of several popular books and also a famous text book on psychology that 
might have used in your intro psych course way back in the day other books include psychobabble and biobunk 
psychology to think critically about issues in the news the mismeasure of woman why women are not the better 
the inferior sex or the opposite sex and in september she has a new book coming out called estrogen 
why taking hormones in menopause can improve wellbeing and lengthen their lives without raising the risk of breast cancer 
i have to confess not an expert on either estrogen or menopause or hormones so not what talking about 
this podcast but then again maybe that is a mistake that making what we will be talking about how 
make mistakes so maybe i should read up on estrogen and hormones then we can bring dr tavris back 
have a conversation about that today going to be talking about cognitive dissonance and why it makes us think 
we never actually really make mistakes so start music sc carol tavris welcome to the mindscape podcast carol tavris 
happy to be talking with you sc so you are a social psychologist right is that the correct descriptor 
it is sc as opposed to cognitive what are the different kinds of psychologist one could be ct alright 
anyone knows what a social psychologist is they think a therapist who gives a lot of parties just very 
chuckle sc you are social ct you are social what it must be social psychology was a field born 
the intersection of sociology the study of groups and society and the individual and fundamentally it is the study 
every social influence on human beings which is to say everything influences on how we think how we behave 
of the environment on our behavior influences of our thinking culture the thing interesting about social psychology to me 
that the field that really looks at something that many americans like which is the idea that we really 
influenced by our environments in ways that we realize and really want to realize because after all all individualists 
make up our own mind very independent sc the american dream yeah ct the american dream so i always 
social psychology wonderfully interesting and rich because no topic it does not cover from love to hate my dear 
and very good friend elliot aronson said that when he was a student he was drawn to social psychology 
clinical psychology is about repair but social psychology is about change a more optimistic approach to the world because 
understanding how we as individuals and how what is happening in our world influence us we can actually take 
steps to improve things sc but you see patients ct no sc so that would be a clinical psychologist 
that would be a clinical psychologist the field of psychology we actually speak about the difference between the way 
psychologists are trained or i should say psychotherapists are trained and the way psychological scientists are trained this creates 
we speak of as the scientistpractitioner gap if you will because many psychotherapists which by the way is an 
word you could put out a shingle tomorrow doing broccoli therapy and it would be completely legal but please 
that sc i might do that ct not broccoli not broccoli really so psychotherapy anybody could be anything and 
themselves a psychotherapist clinical psychologists have a phd in that field of clinical psychology and their field is to 
psychological disorders and problems their training varies from very good scientific training to zero okay so the rest of 
the psychological sciences if you will specify particular areas of study so developmental psychologists study development from the infant 
death social psychologists do what i just described cognitive psychologists study the mind thinking memory and so forth so 
are different specialties within psychological science but most people to this day when they hear they think a therapist 
yeah they think that a couch in your house in ct absolutely and not just a therapist by the 
the couches have been out for decades sc maybe you could bring the couches back ct well there you 
sc i ct your shingle your therapy can have the couch if you want sc right i how about 
instead of broccoli ct sc chocolate therapy couches candles the whole bit ct in our textbook with carole that 
wade and i did for so many years we actually proposed chocolate immersion therapy as probably the most beneficial 
you could do sc i like that ct if i so damned ethical i could be really rich sc 
all have that problem exactly and so you have various arrows in your quiver i know written a number 
books but written one of my favorite books of all time mistakes were made but not by me and 
is on the subject of cognitive dissonance so why you tell us a little bit about number one you 
a coauthor who you already mentioned elliot aronson and how the book came to be and what cognitive dissonance 
ct in one sentence or three sc you get all the hours you want ct i have many sentences 
so i guess first i should say what cognitive dissonance is every social psychology student learned this i did 
i was in graduate school a million years ago a simple mechanism but developed over the decades into a 
rich theory of understanding why it is that when you tell somebody in a kind and warm and friendly 
some information that shows why they rarely thank you they tell you where you can go with your findings 
what you can do with them and just not inclined to be grateful sc i have no idea what 
about never experienced this ct i no you never experienced this so you know my friends still say to 
to this day carol so delusionally dear to think that just by explaining to people an important finding you 
to know that they are not always so all that cognitive dissonance really means is that is the uncomfortable 
we have when two ideas clash with each other conflict with each other it can be two ideas two 
or it can be more commonly an attitude and a behavior so the classic example is smoking a person 
smokes knows that smoking is dangerous and stupid so they will be in a state of dissonance smoke but 
something dangerous and this discomfort is cognitive dissonance and leon festinger who developed this theory in the late described 
as being as uncomfortable as being hungry or thirsty so uncomfortable that really motivated to reduce it in whatever 
you can well if a smoker you need to quit smoking or you need to justify smoking you need 
say unhealthy but be thin and being thin is good and besides that myrtle lived to be sc look 
i look really so cognitive you know i think i took it terribly seriously i thought it was really 
interesting theory but i have much appreciation of its depth of application and then after george bush got us 
the iraq war elliot and i were sitting around talking sc sorry which george bush and which iraq war 
ct oh dubya dubya yeah so this was yeah the so several years later when it was abundantly clear 
the justifications for going into iraq were completely wrong there were no weapons of mass destruction and so forth 
of course the whole country had noticed that bush did not say we were wrong so sorry we made 
really bad mistake about spending a trillion dollars in going into instead he found other justifications for the war 
democracy to the and so forth so elliot and i are having this conversation and he said he said 
with those democrats who thought that bush was lying to the he said think he was lying to the 
i think he was lying to himself he was doing what all of us do when we have made 
decision to do something is we screen out discrepant dissonant information that suggests our decision is wrong we focus 
cherry pick the information that tells us our decision is the right one and we go forth so we 
the decision and then we justify ct he said think that george bush had made the decision to go 
iraq and therefore ignored the arguments from his own intelligence community that that might not be a good thing 
and i said i said and from that conversation because that war was so devastating to our country and 
palpably wrong we thought how do we want to analyze this how do we want to talk about and 
that conversation came the idea to do a book that would apply the many domains of our lives in 
the need to reduce dissonance gets us into terrible terrible trouble not just politically but in our relationships in 
understanding of memory in therapy in really every aspect of our lives sc right right yeah so one of 
maybe we could do an entire podcast on just this but your book is filled with these wonderful juicy 
of people being in possession of an idea faced with new information that conflicts with that idea and coming 
with a justification i have many questions but just give the reward to our podcast listeners by telling them 
of these juiciest examples in love in the law like you said politics already doomsday cults is one of 
best ct doomsday cults well doomsday yes two filmmakers in england actually made a little film about a doomsday 
who predicted the end of the world doomsday is a particularly good story because it was one of the 
that got leon festinger involved with his whole notion of cognitive dissonance which was this he got involved with 
cult many years ago sc sorry he was the originator of the idea right ct yes leon festinger he 
a social psychologist at stanford sc so what years are we talking here ct in the late late and 
and two colleagues infiltrated a doomsday cult in which a woman whom they called marian keech predicted that the 
would end on december of that year and they joined this group and what they found was sc so 
they joined the group they were pretending ct pretending to be believers there were several there were many people 
believed the world was going to come to an end now if you believe the world is going to 
to an end you could do one of two things you could sit quietly in your house and wait 
the world to end or you could proselytize you could sell your house and your cow and go off 
live with marian keech go be with her on the night of the great event sc or chocolate immersion 
ct it invented yet sc alright okay ct the matter with you sc if you invent a doomsday cult 
will offer them ct fine sc therapy ct a lot healthier and safer by the way doomsday cult so 
go to sit with her on the night of december meanwhile her husband slept soundly through the whole night 
not believed one single word of this fine at am no sign of any magic spaceship coming to whisk 
away and save them you see they were going to be saved because they understood that the world was 
to an end no spaceship nothing is happening what to do what to do and finally very late mrs 
has a vision and the vision is that the world has been saved because of the devout belief of 
little band ct this is a lot better way to reduce dissonance between just made the stupidest mistake i 
ever have made what kind of an idiot am i to have made this this allows you to think 
yourself as a smart kind and wonderful person and have your prediction fail this is the essence of what 
aronson did in advancing the theory of dissonance by turning it into a theory of selfjustification two ideas can 
dissonant you like woody allen films and your friend like woody allen films and so you might try to 
your friend okay to be stupid about woody allen films or whatever it might be ct but the dissonance 
most stings is when information about a belief or something that done directly causes us to question our selfconcept 
about ourselves that we feel is really important about ourselves if you criticize something about me that i consider 
or i think good at well so what sc you can deal with that ct but if you show 
how i have not been skeptical about something i really should have been skeptical about i have let gullibility 
over going to be really embarrassed and going to try to reduce that dissonance either by defending myself and 
dismissing the evidence that been a gullible fool so why so important to understand how dissonance works because when 
selfconcept is threatened a good worthy smart person and now telling me done something bad cruel harmful and wrong 
piss off and take your information with you ct to me one of the most important findings of this 
is that it explains why people who are good compassionate caring people will often find themselves continuing practices that 
wrong harmful and outdated precisely because they see themselves as good kind compassionate people a doctor telling me that 
thing been doing in my practice for twenty years is harming my patients the hell it is a good 
doctor so going to keep doing this sc and you give examples for example of in the legal system 
being found guilty by prosecutors but then obviously exculpatory evidence comes along clearly mistakes have been made and yet 
people who did the prosecutions or the detectives who arrested the person in the first place see it that 
ct they do not because the good guys by definition prosecutors and police are the good guys the ones 
the white hats and those bad people are bad now telling me that i a good person put another 
person in prison well not even possible therefore okay if he commit this particular crime he certainly committed other 
and so not doing anything wrong that truly is their reasoning the inability of course there are many venal 
that people might not admit mistakes not what talking about people will fail to admit a mistake because they 
to be fired they want to be fined they want to go to prison those are obvious reasons that 
lie dissonance explains why we lie to ourselves why so pernicious and so dangerous and so important to understand 
and so done politics and the law and doomsday cults love lives marriages ct oh love lives sc has 
ever happened that we are dissonant in a ct oh i want to no of course not okay one 
thing about the law though because this is so important throughout the legal system and in the military once 
believe that they are interrogating a guilty person nothing that person does or says will disconfirm their belief this 
true of the psychotherapists and social workers who believed that they could tell if a child had been sexually 
say if the child admitted it well the child had been abused but if the child denied it well 
child was in denial so there was no if you are convinced that you know what has really happened 
a situation with a child or a suspect or a convict or anybody everything that person does will confirm 
belief to make your belief consonant with what doing the way that many police officers or even trained detectives 
trained in interviewing is if a suspect seems nervous a sign of guilt what if a sign of nervousness 
just been arrested and innocent sc yeah there might be alternative explanations ct exactly which they are not trained 
think of right sc and that parallels what do you said about george w and the iraq war and 
clearly not just high stakes courtroom dramas in our everyday lives in our personal lives and marriages this is 
to be something where our partner accuses us of a certain kind of behavior maybe a twinge of truth 
that accusation and able to justify it somehow ct yes we are we yes laughter yes indeed well elliot 
it this way he said how it he said fall in love and the person is the most wonderful 
this person is just adorable everything about this person is a lovable thing you are in a state of 
consonance because everything this person does conforms to what you think the ideal partner should be then a tiny 
occurs on the landscape of wait did i just mix a metaphor sc a yeah blips on landscape okay 
with it ct crabgrass in the lawn of life whatever it might be and your beloved turns out to 
a habit that you really like so much you like getting to places twenty minutes early and your beloved 
to get there two days late right okay now at first what people do is just dismiss this dissonant 
about the perfection of the beloved and say really not important and most of the time not but what 
next is going to be key for how couples maintain their relationship in the sense that all of us 
things that the other person is annoyed by or agree with and then the question is whether you come 
see those things as behaviors that are too dissonant to live with or whether you reduce dissonance by saying 
what this person is so wonderful in so many other ways that this particular problem is trivial and i 
live with ct but those are the negotiations we do all through our lives you can see what happens 
people have made the decision to divorce is that suddenly they have a little memory surgery and immediately forget 
they ever once loved about the person and now everything about the person is demonic terrible and wrong and 
knew for ever that this person was the worst possible well no you sc a switch flips right ct 
switch flips and the switch flips because now you are seeking to be consonant in your view that this 
is too damn terrible to live with any further and so everything then gets rewritten to conform to the 
story sc in my book the big picture i talk about similar ideas because trying to talk about some 
of coherence in view of the world so i introduced the idea of a planet of belief that you 
a set of beliefs that are kind of like rocks or asteroids that come together under a mutual gravitational 
because they seem to fit together and you you develop a coherent view of how to look at the 
and this is your planet of belief and these planets develop their defense mechanisms right if something comes along 
stray rock from outer space that threatens to undermine the integrity of the planet you try to blast it 
of space right you try to fit it in necessarily and very interesting ct cosmological dissonance here what this 
yes sc i think so yes cosmological dissonance right very interesting you might say given these examples people just 
their right ct right sc is it just a matter of too much work like they get a new 
is it all about status and their selfimage or does it go deeper than that ct well both of 
things it depends what the world view is about in particular and how important it is to you whether 
is really a world view that governs how you see the world and how you behave in that world 
we all have our narratives as the trendy word now is our stories that govern our lives as george 
once said the only species that tells stories and lives by the stories we really the key thing so 
example we can see this with memories everybody comes up with the story of their lives i was raised 
way this is the kind of person i am this is what happened to me that has made me 
i am today that story is often a very powerful one because it explains to us who we are 
now i come along and say to you know what that memory you have of what your father did 
you when you were seven turns out that happen at all that and jarring jarring to learn that a 
you have that seems to fit the story you tell about your life so why we get so upset 
learn that our memories are fallible and are wrong ct so as i said earlier in view about the 
that hurts the most is the dissonance that most blows up the planet if you will that most questions 
lived by whether religion or atheism or a life story a belief about why we are the way we 
and moreover where not just changing one idea but where one idea is going to pull out a thread 
to unravel the whole thing sc so these ideas of cognitive dissonance slightly different but clearly related to cognitive 
that we have the little bugs in our reasoning capacities that motivate us to think one way or the 
motivated reasoning my brain is not giving me any cognitive bias even off the top of my head confirmation 
things like that ct well the key well cognitive dissonance is based and i want to say that this 
a theory of mental functioning that has more than experiments supporting it in every aspect of social and cognitive 
it has a lot of evidence underlying it and one reason is that the component cognitive biases really are 
under it in a way that is cognitive dissonance rests on a number of particular biases one is the 
bias which we might call the consonance bias going to look for information that confirms what i believe and 
keep me in a state of consonance and going to dismiss and throw out and tell you a jerk 
you give me evidence dissonant right so the confirmation bias is key to how we keep our thoughts consonant 
bias that not biased that is a very good bias i really love that bias lee bias sc i 
that bias completely unbiased about that ct completely unbiased about that i think it is the cutest bias ever 
you see think how it plays out you and i are having an argument i am an unbiased person 
if i can just sit here and tell you why wrong and right you will understand that you are 
and i am right and that will be fine because you are biased and not and have a lovely 
sc if only i understood that progress would be made ct there you go and the fact that you 
not accept what i have told you and instead have your own beliefs oh unthinkable that means biased and 
i mean a central filter of how we get through our days and it is the reason that quarrels 
arguments not only continue but escalate because the determination to show that other person why wrong why wrong and 
continues so many of the information biases that govern us in a way can be subsumed under this overarching 
to be consonant to keep our beliefs uniform and motivating motivated reasoning is exactly the more recent term for 
as elliot says every few years somebody renames dissonance theory something else so that they can get their publication 
to show why not cognitive dissonance at all well the same thing sc so in some sense this rather 
coherent than right how our brains work anyway you say that out loud but sort of under the hood 
is the machinery working to make everything smooth out remove the conflicts wherever we can ct yes and we 
add that that is evolutionarily speaking a very adaptive strategy you want to keep changing your mind four times 
breakfast you want to sit there saying should i brush my although then you read a study of flossing 
you just being silly but if we had to change our minds with everything that came along every day 
get anything done and so we choose what kind of package of beliefs we want to hold and for 
most part spend our energy following those than investigating every new thing that might cause us to change sc 
there is an evolutionary pressure to be correct about the world also but clearly a tradeoff right somehow whether 
might be some physics explanation for this not sure some bayesian reasoning some efficiency some thermodynamics explanation but coherence 
you said somehow the coherence of the world view has been so important as gone through the generations that 
is almost utmost when we try to make sense of the world ct well right and of course so 
of the things that evolved to suit us when we lived in tribes little bands were effective ways of 
us rooted to and connected to our tribe mates and of course the corollary of that is that anyone 
is not in our tribe was an enemy who had to be stomped out immediately and their beliefs are 
wrong sc so happy we evolved past that ct yes indeed so those were adaptive strategies for thinking and 
but they always serve us well today sc and pointed out that almost an inverse correlation in our ability 
deal with these cognitive biases with how smart somebody is their intelligence or their level of self esteem the 
you are at reasoning the better it turns out you are at reconciling these dissonances in a way that 
your mind in some sense ct oh not reconciling dissonances better at justifying sc justifying ct justifying yourself yeah 
exactly your most skeptical skeptics sc the firmest entrenchment ct who tell me been or the people who think 
themselves as being most competent in a particular sphere who are going to resist being told they put an 
guy in prison or just killed a patient and so forth of course i want to make it clear 
are many many exceptions of people who really want to improve how they do their jobs and how they 
in the world but they are not generally the majority ct i would like to mention because i find 
many people have found this metaphor to be really helpful in their lives so mention it now we call 
in the book pyramid of and as i say been very touching to me to people have written and 
know this really works for it started because somebody did a study a long time ago of schoolchildren they 
kids and the question is your view of ct so imagine a pyramid or a triangle if twodimensional at 
top of this pyramid and your you and your pal have the same views of cheating you think a 
thing to do but not the worst crime in the world okay neutral about cheating now taking a test 
an important test the final exam your grade is going to depend on this exam we all know how 
are i pass this everything will go south my cat will leave sc seen this in action ct seen 
in action world my will but you freeze on a crucial question you do not know how to answer 
question your grade is going going to fail this is horrible and suddenly the student next to you makes 
answer abundantly clear and so you have it in one second cheat or cheat so in this study some 
the kids were given a situation in which they were able to cheat and some not so forth and 
they found the second you make that decision even impulsively you cheat you cheat because the grade is really 
you cheat because your integrity is more important ct now the minute you make that decision you must make 
behavior and your belief about cheating consonant so if you cheat your attitude will now shift to be is 
not such a bad thing everybody cheats not important and never cheat if you resist the impulse to cheat 
say a minute cheating is not a victimless crime we all suffer from it a terrible thing cheaters are 
so in our metaphor of this pyramid you make that first step down the pyramid you cheat or you 
over time what happens is you become more and more entrenched in your view of cheating as a good 
or a bad thing until over time you are both at the bottom of this pyramid standing far apart 
each other in your views about cheating the one who cheated will think completely trivial and not important at 
and the one who resisted will want to hang you by your ankles outside the school door sc having 
with almost the same belief system ct having exactly and really interesting about this when you visualize it you 
see how difficult it is to go back up and say a minute i was wrong to and there 
many metaphors for this the slippery slope and so forth but by seeing it in a dissonance way in 
selfjustification way you can see how hard it becomes to go back and say know that little jump that 
random thing i did has led me far from what my original views of cheating so that metaphor applies 
so many decisions that we make in our everyday lives from an impulsive decision accused of rape or accused 
some other horrible act and what do we do as citizens reading the newspaper or did i just say 
the newspaper please forgive me so sorry sc your age is showing i want to say anything ct oh 
want to say anything right sc reading the website ct what is a newspaper okay but we sc you 
listening to the podcast ct listening to the podcast we all make impulsive decisions that guilty or that innocent 
then we want to hear we want to wait for god forbid evidence oh please suggesting that right or 
and so we see these in world where everybody instantly jumps to an opinion about everything without necessarily waiting 
evidence or further information and how quickly you can get enmeshed in justifying that initial jump off the pyramid 
when you turn out to be wrong not so easy to say sc i love the pyramid of choice 
think in the crowd who once you explained it to me was like my goodness that just explains so 
ct the faculty at duke university when that lacrosse team was accused of raping the stripper that hired and 
forth and the faculty eighty members of the faculty took out a fullpage ad saying the culture the rape 
of our athletic teams and so forth is disgraceful duhduhduhduhduh in other words assuming that the allegations against the 
were accurate and when they turned out not to be and when sc they were false yeah ct yeah 
were false and when the district attorney was disbarred for not sharing appropriate information with the defense was there 
letter from the faculty saying we made a mistake we have been so quick to judgment maybe we should 
waited for the sc there been that many letters like that in human history ct not so many no 
this is a related to what sure is a cognitive bias not seen it talked about in psychology or 
but when dealing with probabilities human beings are very bad at estimating probabilities but also very bad at accepting 
probabilities go from zero to i think that when faced with something that might happen and not sure going 
happen it seems to me people will only really deeply accept three possibilities that the chance of this thing 
is that not going to happen that a definitely going to happen or that that we have no idea 
it will happen or not sc the idea that and that sometimes the thing happens i think that nate 
got in a lot of flack after donald trump got elected because he gave something like a chance that 
clinton would get elected and afterward he was like wrong things happen all the but we have this inability 
think to correctly judge probabilities that are not or one or zero does that make sense ct absolutely well 
completely true and of course as we know when people make decisions medical decisions do i want this treatment 
has a chance of success and a chance of failure i mean we are asked to make medical decisions 
on the basis of likelihoods and risks and very hard very often to make those decisions or we look 
the chance of something happening rather than the chances of it not happening sc yep chuckle ct so a 
skill to acquire but truly an important one sc a lot of poker players have become very wealthy off 
inability to correctly judge these probabilities and probably also the the pyramid of choice also feeds into the idea 
not only how we justify our own beliefs but how we view others this goes back to the couples 
you were in love with this person at one point now you decide you want to be with them 
and now satan and talking to other people about them afterward must lead these people to say why were 
ever in love with this but it helped but you change how you view the other because not on 
side ct right well what you say we have this guy in our book who is a friend of 
having left his wife of thirtyseven years said to her said to her never really loved well really no 
the first thirtyfive years he did right sc so i just found online this thing has just been going 
how democrats and republicans view each other so not how they view themselves but how they actually i think 
study did ask how they viewed themselves but who cares about that those are more or less accurate but 
ask questions they asked republicans what percentage of democrats are agnostics or atheists the correct answer is about and 
answer given by republicans was ct oh sc yeah some reasonability there the one i liked was how many 
are gay or lesbian laughter and the average republican thinks over a third of democrats are gays or lesbians 
the correct answer is closer to and the same thing for blacks and union members but to be very 
honest the bad ideas about democrats were less crazy than bad ideas about republicans so how many republicans are 
or older democrats thought it was of republicans are over the age of which even a small amount of 
laughter probably the numbers really work out that way closer to sc and my favorite how many republicans they 
thought republicans tended to be evangelical southerners but they also thought the republicans earned over two hundred fifty thousand 
a year the average democrat thinks that of republicans earn more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year 
the real number is not and partly misinformation but it has to be partly part of the cognitive dissonance 
we tell a caricaturing story of the people we disagree with that makes us look better not sure ct 
well yes i mean packed a lot into that those answers stem from stereotypes that we have of another 
a group that we know much about i remember reading a story about some new yorker who had moved 
idaho and everybody in idaho thought he well you can imagine what they thought of him sort of a 
liberal jewish communist pinko gay guy i know but the people in idaho had no experience with new yorkers 
knew nothing about new yorkers and he goes to idaho with plenty of assumptions and expectations about people in 
all guntoting idiots or whatever the hell he thought they were and what happens when you have people living 
the same community who have different opinions is that you see diversity in attitudes and behavior amongst them my 
friend and coauthor carole wade who lives in northern california in a very guntoting conservative area but she said 
politically but we see each other as the real human beings that they are i see republicans i disagree 
but they are caring members of their community and they are active in feeding the poor and the hungry 
they would stop by the side of the road if you were in any kind of trouble to help 
and so not stereotype thinking so asking questions like this of democrats and republicans is asking about a stereotype 
something about that group that you like rich gay crazy whatever it might be sc i was just amused 
democrats thought that so many republicans were at once really rich and also evangelical southerners quite sure this is 
put together ct logic and coherence do not enter into stereotyping you should know that by now sc but 
and i think that maybe does this help also i even want to open the box but social media 
how vitriolic things are and how we respond viscerally and badly to the slightest amount of disagreement online because 
appreciate the humanity of the people behind the words not a facetoface conversation all seeing is this one little 
of belief or opinion and you can react instantly and badly to it in a kind of safe way 
nobody counts to let alone the first book i wrote anger the misunderstood emotion a very long time ago 
an examination in part of the catharsis hypothesis the idea that really good and healthy to express your anger 
you feel angry and it will reduce your heart rate then it prevent you from getting ulcers and all 
of other good things wrong this was my first experience with explaining kindly to people why these clinical assumptions 
freudian notions about catharsis not only were wrong but harmful because the more people express anger the angrier they 
generally speaking and it calm you down it riles you up and so forth and in that sc and 
instantly agreed because you had evidence ct yes i had wonderfully interesting evidence and of course as you can 
thanks to the diminution of anger in our society that sc that was your fault thanks good ct so 
they told me what i could do with my ideas about catharsis one guy wrote to me and said 
wife dents the car i want to yell at her i want to yell at her i want her 
feel even worse than she sc ct really sc obviously the right strategy is to yell at somebody ct 
please so one researcher had identified the conditions under which the expression of anger is likely to be cathartic 
is to make you feel good the conditions okay the first is no retaliation from the target so you 
to your sweetie sc i agree with that one ct are a and the target says right i really 
a so if no retaliation good you are anonymous so the target respond to you your anger is proportional 
the offense so if somebody does something trivial and you hit them with a howitzer going to be embarrassed 
of overkill but if you feel your response is the appropriate righteous thing going to feel good ct so 
gist of these conditions all of which are met by the internet you get to just rant immediately you 
to zap somebody you get to be selfrighteously satisfied showed that person and once again people just failed to 
my advice about this i remember writing a letter to a columnist russell baker who was a funny guy 
he wrote something that i disliked about the movement i even remember what it was and i wrote him 
angry letter i was terrific let me tell you i was funny and smart and stupid because you know 
you feel when writing something in anger ct so i sent him this letter and he sent it back 
me edited he had written in the margins and commented and basically of course i get this thing back 
i realize how really rude been and how i was not going to persuade him of anything in my 
and so then i replied sorry this is not what i meant to say try i sent him that 
and he wrote back and said think this could be the beginning of a lovely and civilized it was 
great lesson for me because with anger two reasons to be enraged one is you want to punish the 
person and the other is like to change the other person or fix the problem between you and a 
of people confuse those motives i think sc and this brings us to the question of what could we 
from cognitive dissonance theory about how to actually change minds if that were to be our goal i think 
implying sometimes not our goal sometimes we just want to let loose a little bit right and maybe we 
squelch that impulse but sometimes we want to reach people knowing that people are defensive about their existing views 
knowing that they want to justify themselves does that give us a clue as to how to be better 
ct it gives us a very important clue one not always successful of course we can do better with 
own views perhaps than trying to change the other guys but the rule the guiding rule number one is 
not make the other person feel stupid for what they believe and this is of course what people do 
matter with you what were you thinking when you did that how can you spend five thousand dollars on 
subscriptions you know what are you an well what is the person going to say you have now exquisitely 
them in a terrible state of dissonance between a smart person i spent this money on magazine subscriptions because 
win the lottery and my children will have money forever my motive was a good ct so when you 
people feel stupid for believing what they believe you guarantee that they will hold on to that belief even 
strongly just guaranteed it so instead you look to understand or talk to the person about why they believe 
they do what that belief serves for them how it helps them whether they themselves see any problems with 
whether they see a better way of getting what it is they want so that you make it an 
right and wrong because that going to go nowhere for sc anthony penn who is another podcast guest talks 
giving people a soft landing he talks about why certain communities have different beliefs that they do and he 
all telling them is that idiots and that irrational and they understand reason and evidence and no one has 
been really persuaded by ct exactly right put it exactly in dissonance terms if going to make me feel 
out of here and by the way it may be that the accuser we the smart questioner really understand 
that belief is serving for the other person what they gain by believing as they do how it comforts 
how lived by it how much investment of time and emotional energy put into that belief one of classic 
severity of initiation on liking for the group a famous funny study but basically what he found is that 
more work and pain and effort you put into joining a group the more going to like that group 
if it turns out to be really a stupid and uninteresting group so all of us have beliefs that 
have spent a lot of time and sometimes pain as well in investing ct i think for ourselves in 
dissonance the story we tell in our book which i just love because i think such a good guideline 
us all this is a true story when ronald reagan went to bitburg germany to lay a wreath there 
the cemetery where it turned out that fortyseven nazi officers had been buried there was an enormous protest over 
going to this cemetery and honoring these nazi war dead and good friend shimon peres then prime minister of 
was of course particularly outraged so were many others around the world but reagan back down ct so someone 
peres do you feel about the fact that your good friend ronald reagan went to bitburg to do this 
peres said a friend makes a mistake the friend remains a friend and the mistake remains a that is 
goal in how we ought to think about cognitive dissonance because the usual impulse friend has made a mistake 
to drop the friend or minimize the mistake you can see this in news reports all the time somebody 
really think as a fabulous person has been convicted of some crime or accused of something and people know 
way to go sc i know that guy been so sweet sound like him at all ct exactly or 
mistake please what he did oh just trivial sc a misunderstanding ct fortythree children really ct so the usual 
that we do and we usually do that unconsciously we make those reductions of dissonance under the radar to 
ourselves to feel comfortable because living with dissonance is painful i want to go back to that point really 
sarah silverman has a fantastic threeminute video that she did when her good close friend louis ck was discovered 
have been committing these awful sexual acts and her video is a perfect statement of a person in dissonance 
says he did was wrong it disgusts me and i hate it but been my very good friend for 
years i know what a great humanitarian he is what a great father he is what a great friend 
able to separate these two things and she said know how going to resolve but the struggle worth doing 
than throwing him under the bus or minimizing his actions harder harder sc it seems to me like empathy 
important here i know paul bloom the psychologist who hoping to get as a future podcast guest he wrote 
book he had a brilliant idea write a book called against empathy empathy is bad and very very roughly 
his idea is that having empathy tends to be something that we do for people who are like us 
therefore too much empathy pushes us away from the direction of reason and rationality and thoughtfulness because it just 
us instantly identify with other people but it sounds like if really trying to understand people who seem to 
doing something we understand ourselves putting ourselves in their place understanding where they came from like you said understanding 
reasons why those beliefs are so valuable to them would be useful to us ct well it the question 
the consequences of understanding you know that the french say understand all is to forgive no it sc no 
to understand all is to understand all period all it is and then once you understand then you can 
i want to forgive is this important to forgive does my understanding give me greater compassion for why this 
has behaved as they have and make me more forgiving of it or a separate question and a moral 
a moral choice for each of us but we all live by the attributions we make of other behavior 
is another big part of social psychology which is how the explanations we make of why people do what 
do affects everything so if you think your beloved has been rude to you or thoughtless because your beloved 
had a horrible day at work and in los angeles a commute home okay be more forgiving than if 
attribution is to their personality just the way they are sc and even talking to people in public if 
want to say person disagrees with me is it because they have a principled objection to what saying or 
because they have bad motives and are not acting in good faith and clearly understand the force of my 
exactly well why the goal really of what it means to be openminded is to make ourselves open to 
points of view without the dissonance reduction reaction is that other point of view out of here i want 
in the but when you can if you have to make important decisions if you can surround yourself with 
who yeasayers who just going to agree with you but who might show you where you might be wrong 
useful sc and then we have the idea of persuading others we also have the idea of fixing ourselves 
been in the crowd when given talks to audiences at tam for example and amazing you explain how cognitive 
makes people justify their mistakes and things like that and everyone in the audience is going the people i 
with do justify the mistakes that right ct yeah they do sc and almost no one says i am 
my like is there a tool kit or a checklist or some set of strategies we can have to 
when doing this when doing this selfjustifying behavior ct sure you notice that justifying your behavior a really simple 
so awareness i ct well sc but so good right at coming up with the excuse so when is 
an excuse and when is it just a correct rational reconstruction of why thinking in such a way ct 
well a very fine question one of the things been interesting to read the amazon reviews of our book 
how many people say i started out reading this book and i was explains all my then halfway through 
explains the government and then at the end it explains ct i see science in general as a form 
arrogance control in the sense that one of the most organized methods we have of forcing us to put 
beliefs to the test and forcing us to face dissonance if the test does not confirm what we believe 
method we have set up to test our beliefs and you have to do a scientific experiment to do 
to take some belief that you hold and say really what is the evidence for this is is the 
changing what i once thought to be i look back on my writing in social psychology and interesting to 
how many ideas have changed irritatingly because the evidence has changed or has become more persuasive sc i do 
personally agree that acting as an informal scientist is a good way to correct yourself against some of these 
like you say much of the scientific method informal and crazy and nonsystematic as it is is about putting 
the possibility that we will fool ourselves one way or the other always very amused as a cosmologist as 
physicist if i say something about the big bang or einstein or relativity some fraction of people out there 
the world who will say just defending the establishment views of the and i want to say of my 
are in the other like become a famous physicist by saying that einstein was sc everyone knows einstein was 
the whole point the whole incentive structure in science is to say great people of the past were wrong 
we can do better than and a wonderful sort of selfcorrective to try to do now on the other 
at the same time i realize telling a flattering story about myself because saying that scientists are the best 
correcting their false impressions they have their scientific training in them ct well no scientists are human like everybody 
i think is that true i mean you guys sc very flawed human beings most of us ct very 
laughter sc a couple of outliers but yes ct well so even scientists are not always happy that the 
results come out the way they would like them to i mean we say i guess i do that 
well enough better redo that another fortyfive times it comes out the ideal scientist we might all aspire to 
everybody knows the feeling of thinking can i redo this so it will come out the way i want 
to come sc yeah and certainly empirically a million examples of people doing exactly that right ct oh yeah 
yeah but indeed science is selfcorrecting or at least it moves forward in certain lurching ways sc fits and 
ct in fits and starts and right people do have an incentive to find something new and different to 
in my field always so interesting to me that all the studies that show that similarities between women and 
and personality traits or abilities and skills and stuff those never get published the differences that are sexy we 
to know what differences there are and the news that there differences news and it interesting but the goal 
to feel free enough to investigate questions wherever they might lead and one of the problems of course facing 
our polarized society is that getting harder for people to do that to question received wisdom certainly in the 
sciences oh my god to ask provocative questions to be a naysayer sc right you mentioned the brain been 
ct did i mention the brain oh sc i think you mentioned the brain i think you just did 
i projected it onto you i know been talking in psychological terms of course a sexy thing going on 
now which is the neuroscientific way of talking about these things actually looking in the brain not just talking 
the person but doing fmri or meg studies of going on inside their head do these concepts of dissonance 
justification map on to parts of the brain is that something that we aspire to or we can say 
or is just crazy ct yes and no yes a number of researchers have tracked cognitive dissonance into the 
they found out which parts of the brain sc lighting up ct lighting up i love that language lighting 
an artificial light up but okay when the brain is in a state of dissonance one of the cutest 
was to have democrats and republicans process information about their favorite political candidate positive information about their favorite candidate 
information about the opponent oh dissonant sc bad ct bad information about your guy and when they were in 
state of dissonance guy did something bad the other guy did something you could see it in their brains 
he they said it was like when consonance was restored it was like twirling a mental kaleidoscope to get 
pieces to fit right people really were happy when the pieces fit right that said i know what learned 
this that we know otherwise and very interested in brain research of course but also written about pseudoneuroscience which 
the notion that if we just have a brain in there really doing science and very often a lot 
those studies are just got a scanner and going to do i what i can with it sc i 
the term ct there you go sc the temptation to find things going on in the fmri image ct 
sc and saying yes there it ct there it is sc the part of the brain that likes rutabagas 
ct and what do you know now that you know before sc now of course neuroscience is very important 
also hard to do right and maybe a little bit easy to over claim what getting ct oh yes 
course it is of course it is and really like all new technologies give a boy a hammer and 
needs pounding give researchers a scanner and everything needs scanning but what am i looking for sc and very 
days we pregalileo trying to collect data understand the brain is way more complicated than the solar system ever 
ct well there you are absolutely sc but you also mentioned or talked about the idea of memories and 
memories always accurate and this is something that i first came to from neuroscience from studies actually from i 
studying the arrow of time the difference between the past and the future and there were these wonderful studies 
i pretend to be able to judge the scientific credibility of various neuroscience studies maybe it is neurobollocks but 
the study said that if you put someone in an fmri machine so basically taking pictures of where the 
is zooming around in their brain and you ask them to imagine a past experience remember what it was 
at your birthday last year where you were having dinner whatever certain parts of the brain light up in 
turning around memory remembering this scene and then you ask them to imagine a future scene imagine what your 
birthday will be like and somewhere else and so forth the claim was exactly the same parts of the 
that are doing the same thing sc of course doing something different but evolution is sort of cheap evolution 
things that are already there maybe the hypothesis goes the way that we learned to imagine the future is 
taking advantage of the fact that we had a part of the brain that could remember the past and 
putting it to use again and the idea being that the memory of the past is not a videotape 
a recording that is stored as a jpeg file or an mpeg file somewhere more like a screenplay and 
we remember the past we download the screenplay and put the play on again just like we do when 
remember the future when we imagine the future ct no no more sc no ct more like cells of 
film where you have a couple of those cells of a film and you are interpolating the connecting elements 
a strip of film in a filmstrip which i mean to interrupt you but i would say something a 
different which is when asking them to remember a past a childhood birthday or imagine a future one imagining 
of those things sc right ct you know that the recall of the birthdays is accurate what asking for 
me a story about what that birthday is that you think you not actively or accurately retrieving every detail 
that fifth birthday party you have a few details about it seen pictures of it your mother has told 
what the color of the cake was or whatever it might be mostly seen pictures of it and heard 
about it and so made up a little memory of your fifth birthday party that may or may not 
true and by the way every time you talk about your fifth birthday party going to embellish it and 
every embellishment your memory of it will change sc and you reinforce things that might not have been there 
you enforce the newer story yes exactly why so dissonant for people to accept the evidence that memory is 
in these ways and we keep our memories consonant with whom we think we are now my i had 
older half brother who had a terrible stepfather who was really pretty mean to him and memory of his 
was how mean his stepfather was to him all the time and he could tell you these stories but 
later when he confronted his stepfather about the stepfather was a disciplinarian and cold the stepfather said you were 
difficult kid you listen you want to talk to me about reasons for things i had to be a 
disciplinarian with you because otherwise go head first out the window and get into more my brother had written 
of his memories his own part in the story and a common thing that we do so in that 
he created a story about how his stepfather was mean to him and made him do this that and 
other thing so past and future is a lovely arrow but what we know about memory well with all 
research on how unreliable memory is i think important to say also pretty damn good too sc pretty damn 
right overall ct overall overall glad i have one sc not completely random ct losing it rapidly and so 
what remains happy for it but that is a hard thing for us i think to understand that more 
for the brain to jettison elements of an event or a memory that we really need to have and 
give us the gist the centerpiece of it but also what allows us to rethink events that happened and 
reconsider their causes or other things that were happening at the time sc and it was interesting to me 
realize that utterly false memories can be just as vivid and just as absolutely convincing to the rememberer as 
ones so i ct oh people hate that people hate that sc right but wrong to have the metaphor 
your mind of a photograph that is aging and getting blurred out over time you could have a very 
very vivid very believable memory that is false ct exactly sc and so the brain is doing something crazy 
not just what i mean not the jpeg image in your brain somehow sharpening up and as we said 
the story over and over again i think this is going to be part of my chocolate immersion therapy 
that telling yourself a story you want to hear just keep repeating it tell yourself this version of the 
you just had in which you come out victorious pretty soon forget it the version that actually happened i 
very effective therapy ct i think a very effective therapy the french have an expression de the wit of 
staircase which is the witty deft retort that you think of making as leaving the party and walking downstairs 
to recreate that memory to be it something you said at the time sc i live in fear of 
and i live in fear that going to be regretful that i ask you a whole bunch of more
