at princeton click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host 
carroll and like most of you i am getting older when i was your age we even have podcasts 
if we wanted to listen to this american life we had to turn on the radio and listen to 
coming over the airwaves and how we liked it as a physicist i study the arrow of time the 
that the past is different from the future so of course there is aging in the sense that we 
all older now chronologically than we used to be but in the world of biology also aging in the 
that our bodies are changing as we get older in a very uniform monotonic way we all had certain 
when we were babies all have certain features and characteristics when elderly and in between we move from one 
the other in a more or less predictable fashion sc but the interesting thing about aging is that not 
inevitable in a sense aging is a choice not a choice that we make as individual organisms a choice 
evolution has made for us if we want to have evolutionary progress then you have certain organisms giving birth 
others trying new combinations of dna occasional mutations but then the old ones have to die off they have 
give way to make room for the new generations aging serves a purpose biologically but now that able to 
things a little bit now that able to manipulate our bodies through medicine and biology come time to ask 
we want to keep aging in the same way we always have sc guest is dr coleen murphy a 
of molecular biology at princeton university and she studies aging both at the level of organisms and at the 
level a favorite organism is c elegans this is one of the favorite organisms of all biologists a tiny 
roundworm a nematode c elegans and it lives a fairly quick lifespan so we can play with it we 
mutate it we can turn on and off different genes inside the roundworm we can see what the effects 
this are on the aging process and interestingly not that hard to make a nematode live much beyond its 
biological lifespan so what are the consequences of this what are the implications for human life sc what talk 
with dr murphy is some implications for what you should do to live a little bit longer in the 
and now and a little bit more fantastical imaginative things about whether or not aging is something that can 
completely cured in the very far future in a more down to earth way what we care about is 
that going to age you and i we have miracle drugs to stop that yet can we at least 
more fulfilling energetic aware lives when elderly people do we necessarily have to undergo the usual decay and loss 
mental faculties that are associated with being very elderly again the answer is maybe not this is a huge 
in which medicine is moving and fundamental science is helping along the way so go music sc okay coleen 
welcome to the podcast coleen murphy thanks sc here at a workshop at the santa fe institute on time 
aging also and a biologist by training who specializes in aging is that a fair assessment cm yeah correct 
how did you get there how do you as you were just saying before we started recording a lot 
books written on aging are written by people who are themselves aging a little bit so how does a 
researcher decide to pick this cm actually i decided when i was a graduate student i had been doing 
on presteadystate kinetics of myosin so motor proteins and i felt like i really understood pretty well how two 
interact with one another and how they worked and i felt like i wanted to start asking bigger questions 
aging is one of the bigger questions you can ask how does it work and pretty much interested in 
it happens to all of us sc oh yeah the box office topic right yes cm exactly so even 
i was fairly young when i decided to get into the field i felt like it was an interesting 
that at that point actually we finally had some really good tools to start addressing those questions and those 
were genetics at that point it was right especially c elegans geneticists had figured out that there were single 
mutations that could cause doubling of lifespan so instead of just studying how things got old you could start 
the question the difference between something that has a normal lifespan and one that lives much and then another 
point was that was right well the c elegans genome had been recently sequenced sc tell us about c 
for those of us who are not roundworm aficionados cm sorry i should have backed up yeah sc c 
is a model organism so a great thing because biologists of all attitudes and angles will study this little 
to death right cm right one of the major model systems and one of the great advantages is that 
simple a simple animal still multicellular so instead of working with a singlecelled organism like a yeast where you 
do a lot of wonderful experiments now working with a real animal that has many tissues and cells and 
of the advantages just from a daily experimental perspective is that when you look through the microscope down at 
c elegans you can see that aging sc right and a little worm about a millimeter is that right 
a little worm yeah about a millimeter long a small nematode it lives in rotting fruit because bacteria will 
causing a fruit to rot and so c elegans will be attracted to that spot and it will eat 
sc okay but you grow them in petri dishes or do you just have apples lying around the lab 
we grow in petri dishes that would be lovely yeah we just have them in petri dishes on a 
type of bacteria e coli and so that gives us control over its environment and so while you could 
it by saying not what it does in the natural world it goes through all these temperature fluctuations and 
in fact what modeling i think in the lab is an american diet so these animals are always wellfed 
in air conditioning basically sc okay so they have a potential to lead long happy c elegans lives cm 
sc but not an lifespan these are rapidly developing creatures cm right these animals go from an egg to 
adult in only two days and then when we really start counting for lifespan once they become adults who 
capable of reproduction when we start the timer and from that point they can live an average of two 
three weeks so any one population of remarkably consistent actually is the shape of this curve you can have 
hundred animals and maybe around day some of one animal will die but at a day still be one 
alive and so that sort of model is what we see on a population where you can have so 
have an average lifespan of the population but some individuals will die at seventy and some will die at 
so the kind of thing that modeling there sc i was very affected actually a few months ago the 
york times had a webpage an app or whatever it was where you could go in and a standard 
where it computes your life expectancy you type in your age and your weight and your activity level but 
than just telling you the final number you will on average live to be seventyeight years it chose a 
number from the distribution and said in this realization you live to be fiftyeight before you and then you 
it again this time you live to be and i was struck very much by the fact that implicitly 
think if my lifespan is between seventy and my expected lifespan how many years i have and the reality 
i might have relatively few years as a relatively high probability and another probability i live much longer than 
it a similar thing for our little roundworms cm yes absolutely in any one population you have a worm 
if say on day five they all look the same hard to know at that day which ones are 
be longlived and which ones are gonna be shortlived and so actually one of the questions trying to figure 
what are the there may be genetic information in this case isogenic so they all have the same genome 
there may be for example a readout in the rna that they express and with those they make proteins 
all those day five if you just were able to survey them maybe there are some of those genes 
get expressed that predict which ones will be longlived and which ones will be shortlived and one of the 
interested in this idea of stochasticity in aging sc yeah just to visualize it a little bit if i 
a grad student in your lab am i literally there with the traditional little petri dish a few centimeters 
and with the eyedropper and poking things around is that what life is like cm basically yeah have a 
pipette with a little piece of wire at the end and be moving them around and in fact actually 
now that on sabbatical been doing a giant experiment with the whole lab and so been in there borrowing 
and moving worms as well sc we for the listeners out there not every professor a leader of a 
spends much time in the lab right this is a cm yeah to be honest i either since i 
my lab sc one has an army that does the cm exactly sc and the thought leader here right 
and in fact usually when for example if someone takes a picture of my lab i let them take 
picture of me at the microscope i find very misleading this is the one exception actually been doing a 
experiments but not many most of the time the graduate students and postdocs who are really doing the hard 
sc right and this has just always been funny to me but in theoretical physics where i do things 
people write papers together the author list is in alphabetical order cm a different world sc biologists understand that 
your name as the leader of the lab appears last in the author list right cm right sc and 
this weird reverse priority thing where kind of very important so your name appears last cm the anchor yeah 
anchor pulling them down and the first author is usually the person done most of the actual labor and 
the writing and hopefully all done some of the intellectual work together sc right right often the grad student 
charge of that experiment or the postdoc or something like that cm exactly yeah sc and so they have 
petri dish and then you are looking in real time in a microscope or are you videotaping cm depends 
the experiment we have sad a little bit laborious a lot of manual labor involved in some of the 
because actually looking at it and making a judgment by touching the worm is it still alive or not 
then we write it down and then we move the live ones sc you take its pulse cm right 
and so there are ways you can scale that up and lots of labs have for example you can 
something where you just take images of plates and done that for certain purposes yeah other experiments that we 
videos of because we wanna know the nature of their motility or for example if swimming in liquid really 
ways where you take videos of them and then you can analyze the shape of their behavior actually and 
nice because we actually discovered recently when we were working on a project that worms that had been this 
a collaboration between my lab and olga lab using these networks of genes in dopaminergic neurons in both human 
and worms got the network that was shared between them and that we knew were expressed in neurons of 
elegans and then use that information with gwas studies genomewide association studies of disease to try to get a 
of new genes that might play a role in that no one has discovered before sc can c elegans 
disease cm that was the question we were wondering could we develop a new model instead of putting back 
for example alphasynuclein which is a protein known to accumulate in disease patients we wondered whether other genes could 
so what looking for because it turns out is let me restate that the known causes of are actually 
more limited than most people realize only about percent of patients have because of a known gene sc i 
is something identified even in nonhuman species mammals cm well not really what getting to now we were trying 
figure out could we model disease and so if you just take it at its most basic level say 
agerelated motor defect is there something that we could find in worms and so why we started these assays 
we would knock down the genes from this list that were predicted to play some role in disease and 
look at how that changed the swimming behavior sc so knock down you turn off this gene cm yeah 
so a lot of details about how that is done we just feed the worms actually bacteria that expresses 
rna of that gene and then knocks it down through a process called rna interference so we use that 
we only did it in adults because we wanna mess up the development of the neuron in the first 
we really wanted to model what happens with age if you got rid of a gene so doing that 
then we just guess if we look at agerelated changes in behavior that look different from what just happens 
a worm gets old which is they slow down their swimming maybe find something interesting and that turned out 
work remarkably well so it turns out those worms for the top set of we tested fortyfive genes and 
top twenty or so caused this weird defect where they would curl up and never seen that before they 
up and uncurl and they get stuck sc so a whole bunch of genes and you have a special 
cm yeah sc that are secret spies that go into the worm and turn off these genes and each 
of them individually had the effect that the worm just curled up in a little ball cm the top 
did the sc the top ones cm our top predictions and so that we really know what to look 
except for this very generic idea that there should be some agerelated motility defect but it could have been 
subtle just like slowing down which is what wild type normal worms do when they age but they had 
really different behavior and so that led us down this path that became very interesting where we figured out 
branchedchain amino acid metabolism may play a role in that we noticed before and then that caused us to 
back into eventually looking at what happens if you look at the gene expression in brains and in several 
the areas that are affected by you normally people have high levels of this particular gene branchedchain branchedchain amino 
transferase and knocked down in patients so this all worked better than we had anticipated but this idea that 
something that we seen yet in worms maybe we should just look and see what happens when we take 
predictions from human diseases and go into the worm sc and is this obviously one wants to ask are 
therapies that are suggested or strategies for treating based on this connection with individual genes cm a great question 
what trying to figure out because this particular gene can feed into a couple of different metabolic pathways one 
thing for us to figure out is what part of that pathway which one of these is it messing 
if you guess wrong you will cause more problems so what currently running sc you poke around with human 
in quite the same way that you can mess with the c elegans cm exactly so what trying to 
out now and interesting about this is not necessarily predicted that this would have had this weird phenotype because 
other labs had looked at this particular gene when they were doing longevity studies it turns out knocking down 
same gene that causes this weird curling defect extends lifespan sc oh okay so you curl up but you 
longer as a curled up little roundworm cm yeah exactly so a note of caution most of us in 
longevity field for a long time have done screens to look for things to live long my lab in 
always been interested in this quality of life effect but i think really important is to take these ideas 
quality of life with age and ask it the same as living a long and so we had originally 
work on cognitive aging for exactly that purpose this was almost just a surprise that you could knock down 
in neurons and cause this phenotype that in the rest of the body causes a long lifespan but i 
want to get that idea out there that important for us to look at all these measures of quality 
life and not just how long something lives because i think we already know that as humans none of 
wanna live a long time in a decrepit state sc right yeah cm we wanna be healthy and so 
think actually more important and it turns out the worms you can actually use them to study things that 
really care about sc yeah i definitely wanna get into this whole idea of different modes there seem to 
from your research not one but a set of different ways which in principle life could be extended and 
have different side effects for better or for worse and then we can start asking questions about which ones 
but what you just said i think is very important trying to extrapolate lessons to higher organisms by studying 
little c elegans so just dig into why okay c elegans one of the things about it as i 
is that we have mapped out its entire nervous system the neurons and we know how every one of 
are connected to each other the connectome of the nematode and so very interesting for people studying the brain 
some sense cm right sc but the human brain has eightyfive billion neurons and so hard to see how 
to extrapolate so both from the nervous system but also the genetic code how similar are the genes in 
elegans to the genes in humans how easily can we say yes this thing in that dna strand plays 
same role in the worm that this gene in our dna plays for a cm a great question it 
on what comparing if at the nucleotide level i think the around sc similarity cm similarity sc between c 
and human beings cm right and sc which is amazing right cm it is amazing right sc of the 
nucleotides in the dna between you and a little worm okay cm right and not even that big a 
you just count raw gene number that difference is not so great around for worms and the around for 
sc the number of genes cm number of gene now of course why saying it depends on what you 
of course then you start looking at alternatively spliced genes and then so you sc and a gene just 
because not a biologist we have dna and many many little base paired nucleotides gonna take that as understood 
a gene is we human beings are associating a whole length of dna a whole segment of it with 
function with some ability to make some kind of proteins and we call one such part of the dna 
a gene is that fair cm fair sc okay and so we have not that many more genes than 
c elegans does cm yeah but we have these wonderful ways of splitting up a gene into parts and 
rearranging or inserting different parts and using them or not using them now i will say it turns out 
have that same phenomenon and we have just been doing an experiment where we worms only have a couple 
tissues they have their skin they have muscle intestine their nervous system some really major tissues so my lab 
out how to basically take adult worms apart and do rna sequencing on those and so we can ask 
those large tissues what exactly is expressed there and actually a list of genes that are differentially alternatively spliced 
each of those tissues as well so even though we used to think that that was an explanation for 
humans were more complicated in fact worms do this too sc so in the sense that one gene but 
plays slightly different roles depending on which organ talking to cm exactly for example you can have an important 
factor that is mostly used for metabolic purposes in the major tissues but it could be used for a 
function in the neurons and so the kind of thing that figuring out now sc and amazingly clever that 
did all this without any foresight without any planning cm selection is an amazing thing but i was gonna 
to your point about the number so this came up at a meeting recently where someone was discounting the 
of c elegans based on this argument that it has so few cells and humans have so many but 
what those cells do at the cell biological level or at the metabolic level is very wellconserved and so 
a matter worms actually may have a harder job so put this out there they only have three hundred 
neurons yet they survey their entire environment and make decisions about where they should go what they should eat 
they should avoid using only those few neurons and only about one hundred of them are sensory neurons and 
this idea if you think about the mouse olfactory bulb where you have a neuron where one receptor for 
one of those neurons worms do that they have many receptors for every neuron so actually trying to figure 
much more complicated things within every single neuron before they can make a decision now they obviously figure out 
same level of things but they do some pretty i think interesting calculations to try to stay alive sc 
have to be pretty efficient in other cm exactly sc with the use of those neurons and to what 
do well number one it was amazing to me to learn that exactly the same number of neurons in 
c elegans very very specific the dna has baked into it quite a detailed blueprint for what that nervous 
is going to look like cm exactly and for aging that has some serious implications for example if you 
about it this insulin receptor mutant called which lives twice as long as wild type it do that by 
over getting rid of damaged cells and growing new ones it has to do it by keeping those cells 
the whole lifespan and so it really changes how you think about what you can do in order to 
a long time and for us some parallels in the sense that we have some tissues where you could 
over the cells and replace them we have other tissues where you do that and so for those latter 
of tissues what a longlived animal is a good model for so what should you do to keep that 
that you may have your whole life like a brain what would you have to do to keep that 
alive sc and what are the organs in human beings where we have the same cells from birth to 
cm things like muscles and things where not a lot of turnover sc right so no way for that 
to leave and die being in cm exactly sc there since born or since cm you should ask someone 
of a human physiologist but yeah for some tissues you just replace them there your whole life or at 
your whole adult life and for neural stem cells but i believe that the rate of turnover is very 
whereas you there are tissues for example your blood you constantly making sc your blood or your skin cm 
so those i think worms at least the major tissues not a good model for those kinds of tissues 
the skin of the there forever in other words cm exactly sc wow okay cm and that what we 
out recently actually not just the skin called the hypodermis actually a metabolic tissue so one of the things 
we discovered by tracking every rna made in every tissue that revealed that to us and we were able 
test that and found out true but anyway worms are good models for certain types of tissues and not 
models for others and so we keep that in mind the whole time when we do these experiments sc 
allow ourselves since we brought it up to say a little bit more about what aging is like in 
and then go back to the c elegans and get lessons for how we can change it so what 
we mean when we say a human is aging besides the obvious muscle cm besides obvious sc and memory 
is it a known list of things that everyone agrees this is aging or is even that up for 
cm that is something that the aging field has come to a loss of homeostasis tissues that are trying 
remain constant and not lose ability that gets lost and of course that manifests in different ways depending on 
tissue so a rise in cardiovascular disease a rise in things like cognitive decline and of course all seen 
more superficial ways you can age like skin sc wrinkling yeah gray hair cm yeah and an important distinction 
you could have the idea for example if you go back to a model system that what tweaking makes 
animal better but if the equivalent of changing hair from gray back to black then not really changing the 
animal so we have to keep those kinds of differences the things that are fundamental to an organism like 
the brain functioning keeping the heart functioning and separate from things that are maybe not so important like wrinkling 
and you see wrinkling or gray hair in c elegans cm you can see wrinkling sc oh you can 
wrinkling cm yeah sc alright very good that was my next question what are the when at the microscope 
do you say this is an older if you know its birthday cm one of the questions asking in 
lab because everybody done a lifespan experiment picks up clues so not just that they do some obvious things 
start moving more slowly and they also lose the shape of their trajectory basically sc so the younger worms 
better athletes cm yes and actually monica lab at rutgers done studies where they show that if they make 
animals exercise by forcing them to swim for a while they actually live longer sc oh good alright cm 
so really nice sc cardio for the worms is helpful cm exactly yeah their skin starts to wrinkle their 
get weak which is why they move as well and actually again in monica lab years ago laura herndon 
some nice studies where they looked at the whole body different tissues by em and they see sarcopenia the 
of muscle tissue just like in humans sc right okay cm the neuromuscular junction starts to degrade and actually 
they start to slow down first shawn lab showed that years ago and what found is that the thing 
precedes all of those is their inability they start losing the ability to learn and more important they before 
lost their ability to do longterm memory so a sort of i know if a cascade but you can 
say a different trajectory for different behaviors the most complicated thing that we find that the worms do is 
longterm memory they lose that by day four of adulthood later they lose the ability to learn and do 
memory and then they lose the ability to smell after that which is required for all of those other 
and after that well after that they lose the ability to move so a period where you can imagine 
middleaged worm they remember anymore maybe learn it can still smell stuff but it might not be able sc 
toward it cm yeah and it can move towards sc slowly cm yeah exactly so yeah not like they 
crash at the same time and i think sort of what we see in humans right sc yeah certainly 
analogous yeah cm exactly i run hurdles anymore like i did when i was i can still do calculations 
may not be able to do certain things and gonna be things in the future that i be able 
do sc number one though c elegans can learn and have things in longterm memory how do we know 
cm learning that was established by some other labs early on and they can do things like negative association 
if you starve a worm and let it smell a chemical then later on when it smells that chemical 
will avoid it so we were interested in asking the question a little bit differently and more analogous to 
we might be interested in when we learn information so my lab started doing assays where we paired food 
a neutral odor called butanone and the idea was that even if a worm we knew they could smell 
butanone but they like the smell they go towards that odor until done the training where they pair food 
butanone sc oh okay so pavlov and his dog cm exactly just pavlovian training and so simple learning and 
we asked the question long do they remember so after we did the training we put the worms back 
plates with food but no odor and asked long do they retain and within two hours forgotten that if 
trained that once sc two hours okay cm right so everyone thinks that sounds like a short time but 
couple things if you are a worm in the world maybe not worth remembering something longer than that if 
food source is not gonna be there anymore and the other thing is i think it might be analogous 
if i gave you a number and then i asked you three hours later you might not remember it 
and two hours is a much larger chunk of the lifespan than three hours is for us yes cm 
exactly so then and this was inspired by work that had been done on other organisms like drosophila we 
space training we would train the worms and then give them a rest and train them again and we 
that if we did that and we trained them for example seven times then the next day we could 
back and they would still remember and that turns on a different set of molecules actually it turns the 
learning i told you about is pretty instantaneous and it can require protein translation as well but if we 
do longterm memory that turns on a transcription factor it gets the signal is worth if you hit it 
times and it turns on this transcription factor called creb and that turns on a whole set of genes 
we later figured out by using the same technique rnai knocking them down that if we knocked those out 
is totally wiped out sc and are those memory stored in the three hundred two neurons that were there 
yeah so that creb transcription factor is only active in one pair of neurons so basically the hippocampus sc 
you get two neurons to remember things cm yeah exactly we figured this out entirely but they must send 
signal back to that sensory neuron to tell the worms when they smell that butanone again what they should 
that they should still like it sc amazing the similarities between our eightyfive billionneuron brain and we can identify 
in the brain of this little worm doing the same thing cm exactly yeah so be fooled by the 
hundred two neurons they actually can do some cool stuff sc it almost makes you believe in evolution right 
yeah exactly laughter sc we just get things from scratch we cm exactly that core set of proteins and 
that are used by every organism to carry out these tasks sc so we have an aging worm and 
said the signs of aging start a few cm well certainly they lose their memory at a point when 
would be difficult to tell by eye that aging so that starts pretty early sc so memory is the 
thing to go in the worms cm yeah and i think that coincides pretty well with the end of 
reproductive time that makes sense why do they need to remember anything because they need to figure out where 
is and then they really need that sc and where sex is cm yeah well actually for hermaphrodites doing 
best to avoid males they actually will run away from them sc right almost all c elegans are females 
cm yeah exactly say one thousand to one hermaphrodites to males and so they really need the males until 
do the times when they would need them is times when they need some genetic diversity so in times 
stress and figured that out too when times of stress they the mothers will lay more male eggs by 
a chromosome and then those males will mate with the hermaphrodite and of their progeny will now be males 
wow cm yeah because basically when they mate the chromosomes will be either xx or xo so of them 
be hermaphrodites and will be males and so you can get these bursts of males and hermaphrodites in the 
sc of maleness cm exactly sc yeah yeah i said females but really hermaphrodites cm for c elegans yes 
right for c elegans the worms that are not males can play the role of male or female but 
are only carrying their own genetic information cm exactly sc and so like you say if you want a 
bit of is there a lot of diversity in the genome of c elegans cm i am not the 
person to answer that there are a lot of people who are asking questions like that and also asking 
natural isolates of c elegans what kind of level of diversity is i want to say yes but better 
who can answer that sc okay alright so you have all these hermaphrodites the occasional dude around there and 
you need to work hard to find sexual partners but you do need to work hard to find food 
and pretty much all that c elegans cares about is food sc right is food cm yeah sc right 
so saying that it makes sense that if you have a reproductive lifespan which is what about half of 
total lifespan cm or less yeah sc yeah that once reached that point your faculties begin failing you for 
reasons and memory is one of the first ones to go cm exactly and i think that makes sense 
those animals need to find food anymore the not so great if so no pressure to keep that maintained 
i think actually probably a lot of work because that longterm memory machinery is very complicated and this was 
surprise to me because earlier when done the work to identify the genes downstream of the longevity pathway the 
signaling pathway we found that there were hundreds of genes turned on and when i knocked down those using 
each gene that we lost only had about five or maximum effect on lifespan so a very cumulative process 
have to do a bunch of different things sc many many genes are involved in this yeah cm exactly 
was different when my lab started doing the knockdown of the genes that this creb transcription factor regulates when 
knocked down any of those they seemed to screw up memory so more of a machine where you lose 
part and now it all falls apart and so that i think would take a lot more energy and 
to maintain in a pristine state sc not a collective effort this gizmo better be working perfectly cm exactly 
so i think why one of the first things to fall apart sc right and interesting just to think 
evolution does not select for longevity longevity is backwards cm the byproduct sc because you wanna have kids and 
as far as the population is concerned not only not helpful in the way in some sense and so 
fact and maybe this has lessons for human beings the fact that there is a lifespan and that supposed 
die is not a mistake what the organism evolves to do cm it might be now i know if 
in the way because old worms eat anything and they have so many more progeny that probably one adult 
around three hundred progeny is not gonna make much of a dent so i think of it more that 
pressure to maintain its health anymore and so the only maintenance that it really is invested in is to 
able to be reproductive long enough to get its job done to make more progeny sc and it is 
because you might imagine that if one particular individual had a genetic code that let it live a long 
and had many many more progeny than its competitors that would be beneficial to it and its bloodline as 
were but the population would suffer because the genetic diversity would be diminished by that one dominant individual cm 
i think that may be what we have as wild type that basically it got to the maximum number 
progeny it could have and lifespan it could have and still do everything because the longlived mutants none of 
have as many progeny so a reason mutant and wild type wild won all these other situations and it 
this flexibility it can respond to differences in environment and when we get a mutant in the lab really 
we are looking at is something locked into one state and so in the wild it survive as well 
it respond properly sc okay so yeah so tell us a little bit go through the different ways that 
can make our c elegans live longer so this i know plays a big role no one knows what 
help us out cm yeah this is a called because it was found in the very early studies when 
were looking at development but it turns out that you can knock down this gene just in adults you 
to screw up development at all and still get this effect of long long life and really important an 
distinction because the fact that this insulin receptor was found to live a long time i think people discounted 
in the aging field longer than they should have because it has this other role in dauer formation and 
it was easy to say just a weird worm sc and dauer is this weird sort of hibernation stage 
can go into cm exactly so c elegans has a lot of lovely ways to be able to avoid 
and so in times of really stressful conditions it will go into this alternative developmental state called and regulated 
temperature and food and crowding conditions but again if we go back to you have to do that you 
to go through that state in order to live a long time and this was shown by andy dillin 
he was in cynthia lab that if you use rnai to knock down just in adults those worms will 
a long time and it also have to be in that case it coupled to reproduction but in the 
of course all these changes that would allow an animal to live a long time or cause it to 
a long time like reducing the amount of food that it has sc so dieting works well to extended 
then cm exactly sc so both cardio and dieting work perfectly well for c elegans cm yeah exactly right 
of course all of those will cause the animal to have fewer progeny sc right okay so you live 
but less genetically useful and so the a gene and you knock it out and the worm lives longer 
it also has fewer progeny is cm yeah so if you knock it out for its whole life the 
has fewer progeny and also true of worms that are either calorically restricted or you have a mutant that 
that state because it chew its food properly sc right okay cm so all of those so those are 
different ways and and then something called which probably everyone has heard about worms will live longer as well 
intermittent fasting but that turns out to act using that same insulin signaling foxo transcription factor pathway sc so 
than not reproducing as much what is it that does to the worm to make it live longer cm 
well what we found when we did so when i was a postdoc and i built microwaves to try 
identify all the genes that were different between the longlived animals and the shortlived animals what we figured out 
identified the set of genes that were different and it just oxidative stress reduction it was a lot of 
it changed lipid metabolism it basically that we started looking at proteostasis keeping proteins healthy basically if you made 
list of everything you need to do to make a cell work better or stay healthy without turning over 
basically does it turns on all these genes involved in things like autophagy sc but sorry getting confused turning 
makes you live longer cm okay sorry so this is an a little bit hard to explain the insulin 
can think of it as when the insulin receptor of this is on high signal of high food sc 
it thinks a lot of food around cm when the animals think a lot of food around the right 
to do is to have as many progeny as you can and you care how long you live okay 
right okay cm so when you get a signal there is not much food that means not much insulin 
means less activity and the response to that is turning on a transcription factor called which is in this 
of transcription factors called foxo and that was found later in mice and now in centenarian studies to also 
involved in longevity in males sc so in some sense the pace of life slows down so you live 
but more slowly and less enjoyably when these conditions cm less enjoyably i know animals look awesome laughter if 
had to pick what i wanted to sc right so they slow down they cm well okay so interesting 
their motion cm an interesting question a lot of labs have looked at just how animals move on a 
and so if you just do that animals look like less healthy by that definition but not actually super 
because if you touch them they can sprint off sc i see so by we mean the ones where 
turned off cm yeah the mutants sorry but the longlived animals so not that they move they just choose 
to and my lab figured out why that is because we thought that was really weird because people were 
around saying is not when every metric we every assay we threw at them they did better and so 
we figured out was that animals have a higher level of a receptor called and another lab had shown 
that levels were super low in males the reason this is important is because it got me this is 
lab and he had a great paper where he showed this difference in males in this particular gene and 
he put more of this gene back into males they mated less well and that was because they exploring 
so low levels of cause an animal to explore more and high levels think food and so the headline 
the sort of pop headline was choose sex over laughter cm and that was all through the gene and 
what we figured out was has very high levels of this and so really choosing food and so what 
did was we used rnai again to knock it down and found out that when you do that the 
are crawling and they never stop sc oh they just keep running around cm they are totally capable of 
they just choose not to because sitting on food they know food gonna eat the food so anyway an 
point in my field because there was this mistaken notion that worms were unhealthy for a while sc right 
they live longer but less healthily and saying that in fact perfectly healthy they think lots of food so 
see the need to exert themselves cm exactly right so i would say so worms are like that there 
other longevity mutants that are not healthy and so it is worth thinking about this idea as we mentioned 
that not everything that lives a long time is gonna be healthy and so we and others did some 
assays and we found that for example longlived mutants that have knocked down their mitochondrial function and those are 
studied for a lot of good reasons but if you look at the mutants in c elegans they are 
healthy so not a good model and then also you have to knock down the mitochondrial function again this 
was again andy work when he was a postdoc in lab you have to knock it down in larval 
to get this result sc so very young yeah cm yeah so the human equivalent of this thing give 
or adolescents a drug that will stump their growth make them nonreproductive but live a long time so not 
model of good longevity sc not a goal clearly so lesser mitochondrial function less energy is going to our 
our muscles just gonna be sluggish and then live a long time without even being able to move unlike 
cm exactly why we really like the model because it really mimics something that we can sort of identify 
if gonna anthropomorphise anything sc we are cm yeah laughter cm that worms are kind of the model of 
like to do in humans so worth knowing what they do and also asking the question can we have 
effect postreproductively a critical point if everything you have to do you have to modify while the animal including 
is reproductive then not gonna do us much good when we finally get interested in taking a drug for 
so what we need to figure out sc right so how much can we extrapolate from the ability to 
out and have happy longerlived worms to any lessons for human beings cm i think understanding what the molecular 
are that change in those longlived animals is really instructive and then doing the actual experiments to ask the 
how late can we do that and my not doing work in other organisms right now but people who 
with mice are starting to ask that question how late can we have an intervention because if you have 
do it the whole life not practical but if you can find interventions like a equivalent knocking down that 
or something equivalent late in life then that starts to be something useful for asking the question can we 
people healthier and then like what i was talking about with there are things that we would wanna knock 
sorry or affect to improve cognitive function and we have to know how is that gonna affect longevity and 
versa if we have a longevity treatment how is that gonna affect cognitive function so asking those questions first 
a really tactical organism like c elegans is very helpful so you can untangle all those things sc and 
seems to take an optimistic lesson from it nothing certainly nothing in the laws of physics but even biologically 
wrong with really repairing our cells to keep them going just if i may extrapolate so correct me if 
crazy just that our biology chooses not to do that because outlived our usefulness cm i think basically right 
but we could easily imagine therapies treatments whatever that tell our bodies actually keep those cells healthy for another 
thousand cm exactly and some mild forms of this idea of hormesis where you have a mild stress and 
turns on a stress response and that in the end makes an animal live longer a kind of thing 
intermittent fasting or caloric restriction or some of these drugs might be doing so telling yourselves not enough food 
on the stress that actually could be good sc right right yeah and i think that heard this kind 
discussion in the context of diets that somehow making your body think that things are going bad is good 
it because when its selfpreservation mechanisms kick in a little bit the body gets a little bit complacent if 
just feed it healthy food all the time and that can actually have bad effects cm right so you 
more of the nietzsche kind of thing really laughter cm whatever kill you makes you live longer and actually 
for the worms so you give them a little bit of heat stress or a little bit of metabolic 
or feed them a little while and then they the trick is you wanna do it too long sc 
course right so none of this gives us worms that live forever cm no but if you add the 
so a nice study that again lab did years ago where they took i believe was so worms that 
lacked their germline another mechanism to extend lifespan and then i think it was they also knocked down the 
anyway they got worms that lived something like one hundred fourteen days sc oh wow as opposed to fourteen 
cm yes and at the end the student who was doing the work actually named the worms sc of 
you become attached a semester cm they were down to four where he named them the names of the 
and then they started dropping dead yeah and then a mutant in that same insulin signaling pathway a gene 
protein actually just downstream of the receptor where there are mutations of that if they can get it coax 
through development then those animals live ten times as long sc wow cm so it just means that turning 
these repair pathways on high now they probably have very many progeny they get through their developments they have 
problems but it does suggest that if we knew the molecular tricks to do to the cells you could 
this of course it becomes more complicated with humans with way more tissues sc no of course but i 
the lesson seems to be that individual things that point us in the right direction and interesting combinations of 
individual things just add that they really reinforce each other in positive ways cm yeah and excited about the 
of exercise because in humans it seems like it just helps with everything so you could argue there you 
give somebody a drug that it would extend lifespan but it may not help their cognitive function or vice 
but there are some things that seem to help everything and i think where that seems like a more 
way to go is to try to find the things that will help the entire system sc right and 
of shortterm strategies for people alive right now exercise good maybe intermittent fasting is helpful probably a good diet 
helpful mental activity is that something that might help cm well interesting my colleague sam wang has done some 
on this who says that all baloney sc yeah it could be not sure cm yeah so these brain 
type of thing it seems the more the idea of exercise and things that help with cardiovascular activity that 
helps more sc so analogy that would make you think exercising your brain makes it a stronger muscle but 
all just nonsense cm right it turns out it just makes people really good at that type of crossword 
which in itself if you really bored might be good sc which is fine right an actual exercise though 
cardiovascular health will help your cognitive functions a little bit cm exactly and as it turns out some of 
was just reading about a study yesterday where using muscles to keep not just cardiovascular health but actual strength 
is good because then it turns out because of this we talked about this yet but the mitochondria actually 
to each other through signals called mytokine and so when there is mitochondrial stress in one place it can 
to other tissues that stress as well and turn on this response and so this idea is that if 
keep your muscles healthy they may actually be sending out more than just this cardiovascular activity it may be 
telling your other cells to improve their mitochondrial functioning sc okay good so teamwork amongst the different cm exactly 
telling them to live a long time have we missed any different mechanisms for making our c elegans live 
cm well interrupting their reproduction helps them sc have kids intermittent fasting keep cm yeah i think those are 
the main ones but all things that we can kinda relate to sc yeah they are things that we 
relate to and actually not just we can sit around waiting for the miracle drug these are things that 
can imagine doing cm yeah i think you should still have kids sc is there any data on human 
do childless people live longer cm a study that gets quoted most often to this point and a study 
korean eunuchs and those men live longer than their cohort sc okay men and women cm well this was 
a study at this palace sc i think it sounds like be very hard to control for an enormously 
other number of actors in that particular study so i really buy that one cm i think yeah that 
of thing i know sc but it seem to be that hard to just ask demographically do childless people 
to live longer cm well i think childless does your germline not function sc oh okay cm and in 
case if a germline function there could be other sort of diseases or other problems that so not sure 
actually the right question to ask but you could ask whether there are certain hormones associated with the germline 
are prohealth or antihealth sc and so right now an upper limit to how human beings live one hundred 
years something like that cm yeah the longest living person that we know about lived one hundred twentytwo years 
one hundred twentytwo years and were they with it at the end do you know cm oh i know 
reports make it seem like she was but i actually know sc again the reliability of that might that 
be a story you want to tell that cm yeah i do know that some debate about what the 
upper limit is the study that sort of the problem with that woman was an outlier point and sort 
changed the curve and so she there that would give us the impression that it continues to increase and 
the time like right now the oldest living human is usually around something like that but it those are 
and more and more people who live that long so suggested that be the upper limit soon sc and 
the different things we were talking about in terms of diet and exercise is it safe to say that 
improve the quality of life when in our upper years not just the number of years cm yeah i 
say that really those things do improve quality of life i do wanna make a distinction between these supercentenarians 
what talking about i think the rest of us are mere mortals right sc yeah we mortals cm exactly 
i think that the centenarians and certainly the supercentenarians they may be people who just through genetic luck are 
to all those damages that other so if i were to smoke or do all these things it would 
cause me to live shorter definitely would make me live shorter not clear that true for the supercentenarians so 
other question i ask what is different about this population because the funny thing is started collecting these stories 
always interview them and ask this question do you do that makes you live so and they always have 
explanation and for about of the women the answer is stayed away from laughter cm but they always and 
like drink a glass of whiskey every day or have two boiled and of course ludicrous an n of 
i think it matter what they did most of them drink and a lot of them smoked because that 
the thing and i think it matter but for us the rest of us we have to take care 
our bodies a little bit better sc they were born on third base and think that they hit a 
cm exactly exactly sc but from everything that been saying things we as individuals can do to live a 
bit longer a little bit healthier etcetera but also we can let our imaginations run about therapies and drugs 
treatments in the future not gonna say when maybe say when but that could extend lifespan more or less 
in principle cm there are certainly people who are working on those kinds of things and they have taken 
to the point where actually developing drugs to do things like get rid of senescent cells because senescent cells 
example are very toxic to the rest of the body so those kinds of drugs like senolytics or activate 
kind of metabolism that talking about in worms turning on those pathways basically tricking their bodies into thinking that 
restricted and doing all those things sc fix yourself body cm exactly and then this idea that you could 
certain drugs that are already being used for other diseases and those are helping people live longer beyond what 
were expecting with just fixing that disease so the idea behind metformin for example now not involved in any 
those studies more interested in the question of like what is quality of life can we improve that and 
we model it and can we figure out what the molecular components that help us improve quality of life 
hopefully those things will extrapolate as well sc can we be extrapolating enough to say that the century is 
last century that human beings will be dying of old age cm maybe if rich enough sc well the 
thing what if a therapy that says you can live for one thousand years it costs one dollars a 
problem that comes up very very strongly right there right cm and i think that is part of the 
among some of the people who are doing some of the work not doing the science but i think 
have to get away from that already true if we think about the way people get treated for other 
like cancer sadly because of the way our healthcare system still works you have a better chance of living 
rich than if poor and so i think that antiaging drugs or prolongevity drugs those would be things that 
be the extreme of that situation sc yeah i think it will become a lot more vivid when the 
people do start living a lot longer be i know be very interesting not quite sure what will actually 
very bad at predicting these political changes cm yeah it rattles around in the brain when working on some 
these things like what are the ramifications of that in general what we really hope though is that if 
were to find something that every person could take would be relatively inexpensive and it would just help them 
something like cardiovascular disease or diabetes or all these metabolic syndromes that people develop in developed countries with age 
would be something that really would help all of us be healthier and live maybe not hugely longer but 
longer but with higher quality of life really what going for at least those of us who work on 
things that we do i know that that other thought is that you can have somebody live forever i 
sure that i will ever get there and not so sad that that would be the case sc yeah 
i think okay i just wanted to let ourselves go wild but i think that right that it seems 
it seems reasonable to imagine that not that go exactly as we are now and then someone will discover 
immortality drug that along the way learn to fix some of the problems knock out some of the worst 
that will make us healthier for longer cm exactly and i think the biggest area where we need to 
about that is cognitive decline because now people are living long enough that they are developing dementias and things 
a rate that people have before simply because they live long enough to get them and so what we 
have to figure out now is how to how can we really treat disease and other things like that 
really impact quality of life in a way beyond just i run slower we really wanna help people be 
until the end of their lives and i think really where the major focus is going to be now 
but it sounds from everything you said so far that there is grounds for optimism on some time scale 
hard to predict how quickly things happen but these are not intractable problems cm not we have to do 
better job of identifying the cause of some of those problems and is really i think the big one 
that the longer we have people live eventually if we figure out that problem they could be walking around 
fine but getting so there seem to the relationship between the longevity and is not entirely clear to us 
so i think we have to work on that while we work on these other quality of life issues 
well but really a big one sc and meanwhile i let you quite get away without raising this other 
that you ran into over the course of your investigations reproduction obviously plays a large role in this lifespan 
and so what gets passed down to the different generations of the worms studying and you came across a 
bit of a surprise is that right cm yeah but i know if i should talk about it sc 
about it and erase it if you want me to cm okay so yeah so i was one sc 
the way so not that you talk about it bad cm no sc that we want it to get 
there before published cm exactly and also we know the whole mechanism yet so we just know this phenomenon 
we discovered recently that when the worms encounter a pathogen which they actually really initially like i think it 
like hamburgers or something to them they love it laughter sc pizza yeah cm and they start eating it 
bad for them and it makes them sick and so other people had figured that out already so cori 
and yun zhang had already figured out that when they eat this pseudomonas bacteria that they then feel sick 
they later know to avoid it and so what we consider the mother is doing that sc and learning 
established they can learn these things cm learning yeah so olfactory learning and so what we recently discovered kind 
because we were looking for it but a little bit accidentally that these animals pass that information on down 
their progeny so their kids already know to avoid pseudomonas even though never seen it before and they certainly 
and gotten sick from it so basically like if my mom had gotten food poisoning and then from there 
out i could never eat that food again potato salad or something sc was the food poisoning or the 
stimulus before they even had the children cm well what we started asking next because you could have so 
the case of my mom if she had that potato salad that made her sick while she was pregnant 
me then kind of one phenomenon different from if she ate it and then twenty years later had me 
so we ask that by asking how many generations do these worms know to avoid pseudomonas and so far 
to the greatgreat granddaughters sc is it possible being taught do they go to little c elegans school where 
say this or is cm it must be already passed down to them their neurons already know to avoid 
yeah sc their neurons know i think that this leads us to this issue that we have a cartoon 
how inheritance works that we get from high school biology a code a dna a set of base pairs 
information encoded there and what we pass down but in fact where increasingly becoming clear that more than that 
passed down there are other chemicals that go along when you give birth to somebody and information can somehow 
encoded in there is that probably going on in this case cm yeah we think probably modifying that dna 
so modifying the dna directly not cm sorry let we think modifying the dna we think modifying the structures 
protect the dna called so these so we think part of it and there may be other factors as 
but we still have to figure it out so know soon but there are enzymes that do the job 
doing these modifications and undoing them so the idea is you could rewrite this called we really know yet 
so try to figure that out but it could be something else sc but there are memories being passed 
and not just the dna but born knowing something because your greatgrandma learned it cm yeah so this is 
blowing my mind and we still have to figure this out if true laughter sc i think it should 
cm but i think that on to something and it would make sense for these worms because if they 
specific pathogen it may be worth remembering i know one really weird question is why they just always avoid 
and so i know if this pathogen smells like something else normally nutritious for them but there in their 
and they have to know not to eat it or maybe eating a little bit of not terrible sc 
a good reminder that even if you knew the entire genetic code of the organism you know the whole 
cm right sc because more things in life than our dna yeah cm right nature is fascinating still trying 
figure everything out sc and on that note coleen murphy thanks so much for coming on the podcast cm
