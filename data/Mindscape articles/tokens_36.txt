and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll so the internet you may have heard of it 
of a big deal good chance that either listening to this podcast over the internet or somehow used the 
to find out about this podcast or to download it or whatever still a state of flux when it 
to how society deals with not just the internet but technology more generally computers smartphones things like that and 
of our sharpest thinkers about this relationship between humanity and the changing world of technology is guest cory doctorow 
cory is best known perhaps as the founder and coeditor of the blog boing boing but also a science 
writer his most recent book is called radicalized a collection of four novellas but also a very prolific nonfiction 
and he thinks deeply not just about technology but about the law philosophy morality the economics of it all 
we really get into the relationship that people have not only with technology but with the corporations the powers 
bring this technology to us and the ways that leveraging our interest to make money for themselves and the 
parts and bad parts of that and how we can fight against it cory talks about these things both 
his essays and books but also in his stories which gives him a number of different angles on these 
problems so a very fast multifaceted idearich conversation i think going to like it sc remember that you can

is linked from the podcast page patreons also get monthly ask me anything episodes you can ask me a 
and do my best to answer it of course regular old episodes always available here for free whenever you 
them so go music sc cory doctorow thanks so much for being on the podcast cory doctorow my pleasure 
you for having me sc been around the internet a long time i know since the very earliest days 
at least since before we knew it as the internet cd sure i think my first point of contact 
with early networks across universities in the when my dad started bringing home teletype terminals from the university of 
and then on bbss that were connected to fidonet and through that to usenet so not as early as 
who helped with the tcp transition for arpanet but pretty early sc so an ambitious question to start us 
then clearly not in equilibrium the internet and the way that we use it is changing rapidly do you 
us approaching a future internet equilibrium even if you say exactly what it is can you imagine various forms 
steady states that we will eventually reach in terms of how we use the internet and how it affects 
lives stuff like that cd i think actually a risk of that i would not call that a good 
as other people have observed the web has become five websites filled with screenshots from the other four and 
domination of the web by a small number of firms that continues to shrink and who clearly carve out 
niches for one another and occasionally compete with each other but mostly are content to just sit pat that 
been i think a net negative for the internet and for human thriving and for things like human rights 
i fear that the path to that becoming permanent is that regulators will observe the dysfunction of a highly 
internet for example a single social platform with billion people on it whose choices about algorithmic filtering and recommendation 
all kinds of negative outcomes including people who understand how to game the system to livestream mass shootings in 
cd and that say to these firms we imagine any way to make you smaller and therefore to make 
bad decisions less consequential we will instead insist that you take measures that would traditionally be in the domain 
the state like policing bad speech and bad and those measures will be so expensive that they will preclude 
new entrants to the market so whatever anticompetitive environment we have now will become permanent and i call it 
constitutional monarchy where instead of hoping that we could have a technological democracy where you have small holders who 
pitch their little corner of the web and maybe federate with one another to build bigger systems but that 
ultimately powers devolved to the periphery instead what we say is that the current winners of the technological lottery 
rule with the divine right of kings and they will be our rulers forever but in exchange for that 
will suffer themselves to be draped in golden chains by an aristocracy of regulators who are ultimately gonna be 
from their upper echelons because when you only have five companies in an industry the only people who understand 
well enough to regulate them are their executives and so you end up with just a revolving door cd 
so the aristocracy will call upon the tech giants to exercise a noblesse oblige where they will suffer themselves 
make certain concessions to the public interest at the expense of their shareholders but in exchange they will be 
a regulatory environment that precludes anyone ever challenging them and i think that will be studied but not for 
because i also think that if we think that google and facebook are intransigent today if we give them 
decade without even having to buy potential competitors to prevent them from growing to challenge them imagine how bullyish 
terrible be in ten years sc so there is a little bit of a leap there that like to 
into more certainly this move for the government or the people asking places like google and facebook to police 
a little bit better to police speech on their platforms etcetera twitter but then so if making that ask 
seem to be implying that actually secretly giving some power to them that we cd yeah sure sc maintain 
ourselves cd i mean mark zuckerberg said it himself he went up and he said regulate facebook please throw 
in that briar because zuckerberg knows that any regulation that is made to curb the worst parts of facebook 
not include as a potential remedy getting rid of facebook what facebook and google perceive and the other big 
companies including apple is an opportunity to becoming de facto state monopolies comparable to say att during the heyday 
the bell system so there was a long time when the bell dysfunctions were very obvious the company had 
in so much anticompetitive behavior that was ultimately bad for innovation and bad for individual liberty and the liberty 
groups and the ability of people to coordinate among themselves and access to telecommunications infrastructure in rural places and 
on cd and yet no one had the appetite to break up att because whenever it was proposed att 
say we have been mandated to become a part of the public safety and security come disasters come crises 
are asked to be a kind of quasigovernmental entity we need the monopoly profits that we get from our 
practices from expensive long distance from insisting that everyone rent their phones monthonmonth until they pay for them one 
times over from being able to decide who can plug what into the system so that we can keep 
from having answering machines unless they come from us and so on we need those windfall profits to pay 
those statelike duties and it took arguably thirty years longer than it should have to break up att and 
arrived at the tail end of the antitrust movement one thousand nine hundred eightytwo we finally break them up 
as reagan is dismantling antitrust so immediately what they do is reconverge so that we end up with not 
telco but three and all terrible chuckle sc anyone who has a cell phone knows that pretty terrible cd 
and all run by former att executives all spinoffs of att run by former att executives like the pope 
up the new world nice that the portuguese and the spaniards have to fight over it but sure the 
they subjugated happy sc and you think that the present situation with facebook and google and amazon having so 
of their respective market shares have been possible in the previous antitrust regulation cd sure you look at google 
company that only ever made one and a half products they made a really good search engine and a 
good hotmail clone and then everything else they do is a company they bought and a company that they 
been permitted to buy prereagan and it just reagan reagan kicked it off but every successive administration has reified 
expanded antitrust malpractice up to and including obama and certainly trump is supercharged at greenlighting absurd mergers like tmobilesprint 
the prereagan era had a pretty widespread prohibition on merging with major competitors acquiring potential future competitors as they 
getting started or cornering vertical markets and if you look at apple google facebook microsoft all ever done chuckle 
poster child for this cd and the poster child for what the terminal condition of it is or one 
the terminal conditions which is that you can raise a ton of capital in the markets then you can 
up and destroy every promising tech startup for twentyfive years cash your investors out several times over and still 
up with nothing to show for it actually the bestcase scenario because then the company sc they were so 
at it cd right the worstcase scenario is they do all of that but continue in a steady state 
to your question about steady states is that you end up with a permanent facebook that just goes out 
acquihires every promising technology company destroys anything good about what they were making takes the parts that can be 
to enhance its monopoly and rentseeking activity and integrates them into its product lines and we end up with 
series of nested walled gardens which is what we have now like last year facebook lost the largest number 
american users in its history it lost oh no left facebook last year but the majority of them ended 
on instagram chuckle which is a facebook subsidiary sc which is owned by facebook yes right cd you can 
this just going on forever walled gardens within walled gardens where you escape one and only to end up 
the next one over sc so what would you like an equilibrium to be if you had to put 
with an equilibrium cd so i would like for there to be a stable set of what for want 
better terms we might call constitutional principles for federation so if you think about us federalism as maybe an 
obviously not without its dysfunctions see the electoral college and so on that what we have are individual autonomous 
regulatory units in the form of states or midsized regulatory units in the form of states sometimes they get 
big sitting here in california but smaller than the nation and then we have a set of governing principles 
dictate with a minimum set of personal freedoms those regulators have to give to the people who are under 
their remit and first among them is the freedom to go somewhere else and if you could imagine that 
would have a set of rules about distributing malicious software denial of service attacks certain kinds of incitements to 
and discriminatory conduct related to protected categories of identity including race and gender and so on and that people 
agree to adhere to those federate with other people who agree to adhere to those well what they do 
that federation is incredibly variable cd so i know a woman a friend of mine who writes comic books 
her comic books are really cool really smart on gender kind of feministinflected superhero comics for mainstream comics publishers 
she is the target of harassment by a small group of really terrible men on twitter who have a 
for gaming antiharassment policies and what they do is they send you just revolting threatening direct messages which they 
as soon as you read them because twitter accept screenshots so easy to doctor and twitter to its credit 
you actually delete something twitter readily access it pretty much deleted maybe a backup somewhere but you say to 
find that dm that was in my messages two hours gone they see it which is good you want 
you if you and your group of hong kong protesters are planning a protest you want the politburo to 
able to order twitter to turn over sc you want to be able to delete things that should be 
right yeah cd yeah good sc although if i receive a dm maybe i should be able to keep 
copy of it chuckle cd what if been arrested by the chinese state and you and the person who 
you the message wants to delete the incriminating side of it sc yeah ideally i should be able to 
it but maybe the chinese police let me do that yeah fair cd yeah so you get arrested your 
is now in the hands of the hong kong security services i have you our privy to a thread 
messages that expose fifty organizers that you work with they delete the messages you want it to disappear from 
phone different threat models and different use cases and actually gonna come to that in terms of what could 
done so then these men what they do is they send messages in your public twitter stream that reference 
threatening message but without the threatening message as a key they do not seem threatening in and of themselves 
so what they can do is continually harass you but without ever giving rise to an offense that would 
them kicked off twitter cd now imagine that twitter could not avail itself of any legal tools to prevent 
third party from making an interoperable twitter service a rival to twitter like a mastodon instance that you could 
to both read and write twitter and my friend and her dozen friends who are targeted by these one 
men could make a twitteralike that they could use to be part of the public discourse that takes place 
twitter but that would have a rule that all of these shitty men were blocked and that would allow 
to recover dms for the purposes of dealing with this kind of harassment and so on you could now 
a broad set broad latitude within a decentralized local means of communicating with everybody else that would allow people 
were targeted for harassment to deal with this oneinamillion use case remember got billion users that means got two 
three hundred oneinamillion use cases every day cd so it would allow you to deal with this oneinamillion use 
that is inconceivable but big firms would be able to deal with even if they had the political will 
they and you could still on that periphery be part of this larger conversation you have to opt out 
being in the world just to be protected from grotesque harassment that would allow you to have a use 
in which you say want the evidentiary twitter where dms are not deleted i want to be able to 
them even if my counterparty and you could opt into being in that twitter and twitter you have to 
for twitter to adjudicate your case to decide that what you want sc so imagine twenty different clones of 
each with different rules and also interoperability as part of our future utopia equilibrium cd yeah so that you 
have not just interoperability through standardization which you might call voluntary interoperability and not just interoperability through indifference what 
might call indifferent interoperability the people who make your car care where you plug in the cigarette lighter apple 
wants everyone who makes an app to follow a set of interoperable terms so got voluntary interoperability or enthusiastic 
your car got a different interoperability those are both good and really important standards fall into that category and 
on talking about adversarial interoperability when i plug something in that you really want plugged in because it helps 
improve my life or the life of my customers or users and so that would be like thirdparty printer 
cd so imagine if twitter could avail itself of technical countermeasures to try to block people who scrape their 
twitter messages and move them into a twitteralike service with their own rules but they sue over patent infringement 
sue for violating terms of service they sue under the digital millennium copyright act and its prohibition on circumvention 
bring a tortious interference claim that you would have blanket immunity for all legal theories for any activity that 
interoperability that allows users to have more control over the technologies that they use sc and i get the 
that this is not what these companies want facebook used to allow me to just forward my tweets and 
them on facebook but they cut off that ability i presume because they want too much interoperability cd facebook 
further than that facebook when it launched had a tool that would log into myspace pretend to be you 
your login and password get waiting myspace messages put them in your facebook inbox and let you reply to 
because how they solved the collective action problem of facebook is better than myspace but my friends are on 
i leave myspace until my friends are on facebook they leave myspace until on facebook all stuck here within 
just let you have one foot on either side of the walled garden now facebook having done that sued 
sc of course cd called power ventures that made exactly the same tool that would allow you to read 
facebook messages and your linkedin messages and your twitter messages all within one interface and get you away from 
being able to observe everything you do spy on you while doing it and then use that information to 
ads and so on sc what was the grounds for the lawsuit cd the computer fraud and abuse act 
the computer fraud and abuse act was passed in one thousand nine hundred eightysix after ronald reagan watched the 
wargames and panicked laughter cd the federal prosecutors have been champing at the bit to have a more expansive 
of cyber crime and hacking they arrived at a definition that was so expansive that effectual effectively without limits 
said that any time you exceed your authorization on a system that does not belong to you that you 
commit a felony right now that sounds like a reasonable thing on its face if you work at the 
store and your boss gives you the right to check in and out videos but give you the right 
go back and get the home addresses of the cute customers and go stalk them at home then exceeded 
authorization but today authorization is terms of service that sprawling novella of garbage legalese that no ever read and 
boils down to like by being dumb enough to use the service you agree that allowed to come over 
your house and punch your grandmother and wear your underwear and make long distance calls sc right cd right 
so facebook argued that power ventures had violated its terms of service and in so doing had violated the 
fraud and abuse act they built on a decision that blizzard had gotten the world of warcraft people over 
interoperable game server called bnetd now that law is being eroded or that precedent is being eroded linkedin just 
a court challenge against a competitor called haiku that scrapes linkedin publiclyavailable linkedin data to create analytics for employers 
that was fine with linkedin for a while and then linkedin launched its own analytics product and shut down 
and sued them and the court not only found that haiku was not violating the computer fraud and abuse 
they actually ordered linkedin to not take technical countermeasures to shut down haiku to allow haiku to continue to 
the service cd so that legal theory that exotic legal theory which was very expensive and hardwon for facebook 
a generation of technologists right this is why venture capitalists call business which grows yearonyear by double digits and 
generating billions of dollars in profits they call that the kill zone right under normal market conditions you would 
that if you had double digit yearonyear growth for a multibillion dollar business that people would be very excited 
figuring out how to take your margin and offer the same service at a margin cd but no right 
the facebook stands alone no one will fund you to compete with facebook the last company that really tried 
earnest was snap and facebook used an acquisition of theirs an acquisition that would have been illegal prior to 
a company called onavo that made a deceptive battery monitor that actually monitored everything you did on your phone 
sent that telemetry to facebook to discover that users were downloading and installing snap and to then gather in 
detail how snap was being used and facebook used that to both buy and tweak instagram to become a 
snap competitor right sc trying to think if i had this battery monitor when was this happening cd it 
about seven years ago sc okay cd onavo then morphed into a surveilling vpn which is like the most 
piece of product but a vpn that keeps what you do private from your isp but spies on everything 
do and sends it to facebook sc so examples of adversarial interoperability just because the company really tried to 
it like apple made software where you could read microsoft word documents but you seem to be suggesting that 
legal issues here i mean is it true that if facebook just tried hard enough on the tech side 
could prevent this kind of interoperability cd well i mean i think a thing that facebook would say they 
say need to take away our legal defenses we have a monopoly on the smartest technologists and so we 
always but not what they did right they just shut down power ventures they sued power ventures not like 
are cheaper than programmers maybe they just wanted to make an example but inclined to think that the legal 
are the real chilling effect you know a truism in information security that defenders have a harder job than 
if you are building a wall around your castle that wall needs to be perfect if i wanna knock 
down i need to find one mistake made right cd and so that asymmetry makes life very very hard 
defenders and the fact that facebook is supporting two thousand three hundred oneinamillion use cases every day means that 
bots and distinguishing them from users who are just doing things that are weird is very hard the total 
of what passes for normal user activity among billion user pool is so broad that just plenty of latitude 
make scrapers that look like a user somewhere sc i wonder if a lot of people on the legal 
have the example in mind of internet explorer where it was thought to be a monopoly and there were 
lot of legal maneuvers to sort of break up that monopoly but in retrospect it kind of because it 
very easy to replace it with someone else do a lot of people think that facebook will just be 
organically by better competition or is this truly a different situation cd so an interesting question about what happened 
explorer explorer was at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit that ultimately did not succeed but microsoft insiders say 
what happened through the antitrust enforcement action was that it changed the internal calculus inside the board rooms at 
that microsoft like every other big institution has a spectrum of attitudes and ideas about products and the best 
to launch them into the market but historically people who said should do things that would be illegal under 
always won the argument because every time microsoft did that they gained market share sc and they won yeah 
and then you have the antitrust action and the antitrust action against microsoft is really interesting it was the 
one where the depositions were videorecorded and released to the public and bill gates when he was deposed lost 
so he is on the spectrum and his spectrum behaviors became very very obvious during that deposition in a 
that we had not seen in bill public appearances he starts rocking he starts stimming and then when talking 
them very belligerent and very unsympathetic right and there is a story from microsoft insiders that says that after 
every time anyone proposed doing something really terrible someone in the boardroom would say make them put bill back 
the right cd it is often credited with the growth of google right how did google manage to avoid 
kind of anticompetitive behavior that microsoft was happy to engage in with every other competitor well it might have 
that they were stayed by what you might call the policemen inside right the internalized belief that if you 
this that you would face terrible consequences cd certainly that seems to have been the case with ibm so 
or and when ibm was creating the first pcs its first pcs they did a bunch of things that 
uncommon for ibm so one was that they used commodity components and this is a company that had been 
to make its own machine screws that were proprietary for their mainframes they also did not sue phoenix the 
that reverse engineered their roms and reimplemented them so that compaq and every other pc manufacturer can make pc 
now that year was also the year that the doj was finally stepping back from a antitrust enforcement action 
them over mainframes that only ended because mainframes ceased to be a line of business for ibm getting them 
over mainframes would be sc have that monopoly go ahead cd yeah you got a perch on monopoly is 
right sc yeah cd and again there are lots of people who say that the reason that ibm did 
extraordinary things is that the people in the boardroom who had historically said not use bullying tactics against our 
use commodity components because it allows us to iterate faster and even though we control the whole supply chain 
can do that those people started to win the arguments after twelve years of being batted around up and 
the twelve miles of dirt road by the doj finally they were starting to win the arguments sc is 
a problem that people seem to maybe like living in walled gardens or even they like sort of handing 
some of their property their rights to use their own property to these major corporations like with phones and 
services and so forth cd so if that were the case we need countermeasures right sc yeah cd if 
loved paying extra for ink because they knew it was reliable then printer manufacturers have to take all those 
to prevent thirdparty ink and if people loved the convenience of letting apple decide which apps they could use 
apple need to take so many countermeasures to prevent thirdparty app stores the reality is that locking users in 
a kind of moral hazard right it takes all the things that are good about your product that your 
actually like like the reliability of your ink or the fact that the apps are vetted and have high 
and invites you to abuse that trust because you know that if you abuse the trust once kind of 
into the walled garden that no way for them to use markets to punish you and so you see 
monotonic rationing up of printer ink and of incredibly restrictive terms over printers so you know hp now makes 
where you only rent the ink and so you subscribe sc like really you rent the ink cd yeah 
subscribe to a certain number of pages per month and it matter how much ink is in your printer 
exceeded your page budget your printer print right hasbro just did this with its new nerf gun they have 
nerf gun that fire thirdparty darts and it uses technical countermeasures to prevent you from firing thirdparty darts if 
loved hasbro darts those countermeasures would be superfluous sc i think of the kcup coffee makers as the quintessence 
this right cd yeah sure sc like you buy the machine but then on hook for the rest of 
life to those little cups cd yeah yeah and if true that what people want you need a patent 
you need copyright enforcement you need terms of service you could just rely on your incredible adoration for your 
sc but people do seem to like facebook right or at least most cd thirteen million people left it 
year sc yeah true cd facebook has at least as many hostages as it has users sc yeah cd 
again like i think that sc by the way this is totally me being advocate cd no i understand 
i basically left facebook because i find it repellent cd yeah yeah a zucker vegan sc but a lot 
people there cd i use any facebook products you know i think that facebook does have this incredible advantage 
is separate from its monopoly advantage which is the network effect i am skeptical of network effects as the 
of central explanation for how we ended up with these monopolies but the network effect of like everyone on 
little league team is using facebook to organize games means that you either take your kid out of little 
or you get a facebook account that clearly works to favor cd the monopoly part is that not hard 
imagine a thirdparty service that would allow you to monitor the things going on with the little league game 
not having to have a facebook account facebook very interesting in the wake of cambridge analytica has used the 
panic over cambridge analytica to militate against any service that would allow you to do that because they say 
you can monitor the little league game maybe you could evade our antiharassment or antidata mining or antipolitical manipulation 
you and in fact zuckerberg in these leak to audio recordings that were just came out this week as 
this from his internal meetings he says that elizabeth warren is misguided in wanting to break up facebook because 
someone with the kind of resources that facebook has could prevent political manipulation sc a benevolent dictatorship yes laughter 
well and hilarious that answer to his catastrophic failure to prevent political manipulation is to entrust him and deputize 
to prevent political manipulation and talk about fool me twice shame on me sc and i love the prevalence 
days of when trying to sign up for a new service they give you the option of logging in 
google or logging in with facebook and i think that i was trying to do one just the other 
that those are the only two options cd right sc like i create an account on the service and 
just seems to be handing myself over to these big companies i mean this is why i keep pressing 
this because the convenience of it must be attractive to a large fraction of people even if others who 
it you know they just live on facebook and let facebook handle everything cd yeah but i think got 
where you want an right you could have facebook manage all your logins sc yeah cd and you could 
the ability to take all that stuff outside of facebook and put it somewhere else if you decided that 
a good steward of your stuff and if that were the case right if facebook could not prevent that 
they would be incentivized to be more respectful of your privacy and your attention and your data right that 
our conservative friends like to remind us incentives matter facebook has no incentive to treat you with dignity because 
know that stuck like that old lily tomlin sketch about the phone company we have to care the phone 
right chuckle sc yeah cd facebook have to care even if you leave facebook you will become an instagram 
why would facebook ever care sc and it sounds like the only way to really have change here is 
legal means i mean not going to be small actions by groups of users complaining right cd so i 
that larry framework for change really works here that the four drivers of change are code technologically possible law 
permissible norms socially acceptable and markets profitable and clearly competing with facebook could be profitable that under normal circumstances 
would actually go a long way to correcting the worst excesses of facebook but there are legal impediments to 
corrections now the fact that there are businesses like snap that are really pissed off at facebook and like 
that are really pissed off at google over their anticompetitive behavior means that there is a commercial constituency to 
for legal reform so not just consumer rights groups that are doing this now i think that snap or 
are gonna be any better stewards of their power than facebook is not a tech exceptionalist right i think 
tech executives are either so virtuous that they be regulated or be regulated or so venal that they will 
be wicked i think that they are everyday sociopaths and incentives matters cd and if you let them get 
with murder then have blood on their hands so i think that although we have these commercial constituencies that 
militate for legal reform that the eyes on the prize should be about a much more pluralistic world where 
have lots and lots of people doing it and where things like technology come in one of the things 
we know is that whole products can be replaced with small scripts that a lot of times users have 
something that started off as something a network administrator would do to automate their most boring parts of their 
and just turn it into a thing that they do all day long and just make stuff happen and 
users given access to easy technology that toolsness can make that the laws threaten that people have an understanding 
the need for because had a normative shift that we can affect gross changes in user behavior the risk 
to just put this all down to individual choice right sc yeah cd the same as with climate change 
the reason we have climate change is not because of your lack of recycling diligence and the reason we 
facebook is not because you individually choose to leave facebook that these big social factors that are at play 
what has created this dominance for facebook created the social crisis the climate crisis and averting it does require 
action but that individual action is to join groups and to use those groups to affect social scale change 
not gonna happen in your blue box gonna happen at your city hall meeting at the ballot box in 
streets where the change is gonna come from sc and written about this stuff in numerous venues and genres 
one of them i need to mention is science fiction and you have a new book out called radicalized 
my favorite story and it was it unauthorized bread cd unauthorized bread yeah sc unauthorized bread which deals directly 
this idea of the company having the right to let you do things why you tell the audience a 
bit cd sure yeah unauthorized bread a story about people in refugee housing that has been created as part 
a variance to a developer a property developer who wanted to build a luxury building and wanted planning permission 
add extra stories to it over the limit and they said you can but some of those stories have 
be subsidized they have to be below market and this happens all the time and just as with those 
a poor door and different lobbies for the poor sc yeah certainly here in la we get a lot 
this cd yeah and new york london all over the place so you go through the marble lobby with 
doorman you go literally around the back where the garbage cans are but they go further the elevators stop 
them unless no one from the above market rent side or the market rent side that wants to use 
and then every appliance in the poor floors is designed to extract revenue from those people that the dishwasher 
washes authorized dishes and the laundry machines only wash authorized clothes and the toasters only toast authorized bread and 
is this extractive program that we see already in lots of places sc not that much of an extrapolation 
yeah the poorer you are the worse the technology treats you from the subprime credit card you have which 
been tuned with algorithms to maximize the amount of penalties that you end up paying all the way down 
your subsidized cellphone which will cost you more and come with more shovelware and spyware than the full market 
that you buy not always true that if not paying for the product the product you can also be 
product if paying for it chuckle but more of the product if not paying for the product cd and 
is bad enough but then the kinds of hedge funds that like to back this kind of business are 
the kinds of financial engineers who periodically take their business through a bracing structural bankruptcy for the purpose of 
debt and restructuring and that means that all the servers stop working one day and then that means the 
work and this incentivizes the protagonist of this story a libyan refugee named salima to look up how to 
her appliances and the experience is so sc so that she can toast her bread cd so she can 
her bread chuckle but then because it feels good because seizing the means of computation just feels right she 
other people how to do it and it kind of sweeps the building like wildfire and the story takes 
turn when these companies start to restructure to bankruptcy and thanks to the digital millennium copyright act in section 
thousand two hundred one of it which makes it a felony to bypass copyright locks now all facing felony 
and if a refugee that can mean losing your refugee status and that can mean death and so suddenly 
stakes go from which bread can i toast in my toaster to life or death sc and how do 
find the effectiveness both in getting the message out but also just for your personal pleasure in writing that 
the science fiction vein versus just a straightforward article or book cd well you know i do both and 
think both are necessary sc right so you can compare in a way that most people yeah cd yeah 
both are necessary but i have a theory of change i call peak indifference which is that when you 
a real problem but where that cause and effect are separated by a lot of time and space sometimes 
to know whether there is a real problem or what you should do about it whether smoking and cancer 
climate change or making bad technological decisions and if you neglect that problem then over time it will create 
debt get sicker from the cigarettes that your house will burn down or be flooded out your technology will 
to abuse you in more grotesque and gratuitous ways and so after a while the job of an activist 
from convincing people that there is a problem to convincing them that not too late to do something about 
because denialism can slide into nihilism in just a hot second you can go from sure the rhinos will 
to only one of them left but since only one left i might as well find out what he 
sc and right now for climate change cd sure sc exactly what hearing right now cd yep absolutely you 
sc the same people who said there never was a problem said you are now saying possibly solve the 
or on the right you have the rise of ecofascism which is an ideology expressed by the christchurch killer 
says no climate change is real that means that we have to get rid of half the human race 
it should be the brown and sc surprise chuckle cd an old ideology hardin who wrote the tragedy of 
commons was an ecofascist and the sierra early founders dabbled in ecofascism and so on but come roaring back 
a major motif in our society right now especially among the far right cd so the thing about peak 
is that the sooner you can reach that moment the sooner you can reach the moment where a critical 
of people acknowledge the existence of the problem the easier it is to avert nihilism because the more wiggle 
you have to take action to improve things the less debt policy debt incurred and the less obvious policy 
seems the less inevitable the policy bankruptcy seems and fiction is a really good way to make people vividly 
the consequences of longoff activities nonfiction can do it the silent spring is obviously an example that often gets 
but if you think about the role that say one thousand nine hundred eightyfour played in our privacy debates 
fifty years where the abstract question of well if there were cameras everywhere i would feel different and some 
my activities would be chilled is a very bloodless argument but that as an orwellian notion imports by reference 
entire visceral experience of reading although it takes the dry skeleton of the argument and puts blood and flesh 
muscle on that skeleton and makes it very very literally visceral sc and maybe reach different audiences also cd 
sc absolutely one of the issues in the modern age that different audiences are getting their information from different 
and one of the interesting things about climate change for example is how become this tribal marker especially within 
united states a lot of my understanding is a lot of conservative parties worldwide like of course the climate 
changing why would we deny but in the us become something where if on this side of other political 
you have to deny climate change cd yeah and i think that the fragmentation of our beliefs is important 
overrated compared to the fragmentation of our epistemology of how we know what to believe in that in a 
technical society we long ago had to put away the idea that you would just ask a trusted person 
was true and instead we have trusted processes that there are reasons that people of good will might disagree 
the technical answer to hard questions like what what food preparation techniques will allow you to eat your dinner 
dropping dead before breakfast or which pharmaceutical products are safe to use and under what circumstances or is the 
steel joist holding up the roof over our head of sufficient strength and flexibility to keep us all from 
from the roof falling on our head sc or did the manufacture of this jumbo jet actually put in 
right safety mechanisms cd right right or is the tailpipe of your car pumping out so much nox that 
kill you all of those things are questions that we hope to navigate individually even if you had the 
literacy to know which scientific journals are trustworthy and which ones and the statistical literacy to evaluate studies to 
whether they were performed well you have the domain expertise to then actually look at the technical particulars of 
of those studies to evaluate them but we have a process we have truthseeking exercises where independent adjudicators hear 
multiple experts they listen to the competing claims they explain their reasoning when they come to a conclusion they 
bound by strict ethical guidelines about how they can be related to the parties whose claims hearing and there 
a process for appeal if new facts come to light or if the process was revealed to have had 
cd but that process has become increasingly fraught the ability of truthseeking to actually look for the truth is 
cabined by the extent to which the truth gores a billionaires ox and so truthseeking has become something of 
auction and that is really problematic you alluded to boeing and the seven hundred thirtyseven max the seven hundred 
max was a decision by an expert body that boeing could selfregulate certain elements of its safety features that 
wrong on its face it should have been obvious that that was wrong the reason they came to that 
the incentives matter chuckle cd right and the reason they came to that conclusion is because aerospace is super 
and boeing has been selfregulating for a very long time because all of the regulators are drawn from its 
ranks or the ranks of its direct competitors who when only five companies left in an industry all the 
in each company used to work at the other ones chuckle so you really end up with just one 
so you look at the fcc the good fcc chairman we had under obama tom wheeler was a comcast 
and the bad fcc chairman we have under trump ajit pai is a verizon lawyer when truth seeking becomes 
auction you are cast into an epistemological void where literally you could die because you know true and what 
being a really good example cd people who believe in vaccinations i think are wrong but the story they 
of why they trust vaccines is right they say the pharmaceutical industry is super concentrated run by financialized management 
who care if they kill the people who take their products and the regulators who are supposed to regulate 
actually let them get away with murder and as exhibit a i would cite the opioid epidemic and understanding 
claims that the conclusions that our truthseeking exercises have come to about vaccines are true and the conclusions that 
came to about opioids were false because the reason we have the opioid epidemic is not just because of 
sacklers and purdue pharma because the nih and the fda allowed tainted evidence to produce guidance about the safety 
opioids that was wrong and should have been understood to be wrong cd it even a particularly good forgery 
majority of it all cited back to a fivesentence letter sent by a boston university doctor dr jick to 
new england journal of medicine in the where he observed in a qualitative but not quantitative way that the 
in his hospital were not becoming addicted to opioids when used for pain relief at the rate predicted by 
literature as it existed and it was literally just a letter not a study it became the most cited 
that the new england journal of medicine ever published they call it the five most consequential sentences in the 
of the new england journal of medicine sc wow i did not know about this yeah cd it should 
been obvious it should have been obvious to anyone whose job it was to keep the pharmaceutical companies honest 
this was not about what was healthy or safe it was about what was profitable and so you really 
fault vaccine denial because the shape of the vaccine conspiracy the alleged vaccine conspiracy is the shape of a 
conspiracy the opioid conspiracy sc and sometimes there are conspiracies right yeah cd increasingly there are conspiracies so a 
belief among some africanamericans that in katrina the reason that the black parishes were flooded was that the levees 
dynamited to spare the white neighborhoods i think that happened it seems that that happen however in the in 
mississippi they dynamited the levees to flood the black neighborhoods and spare the white neighborhoods and so in the 
of confirming or disconfirming evidence the hypothesis that maybe this once is accident twice is coincidence three times is 
action if happened a bunch of times not unreasonable to think maybe it happened again you scratch a ufologist 
find someone who knows chapter and verse about real military and aerospace coverups now i think that area fiftyone 
stuffed full of aliens chuckle but i do think that there are military coverups cd and so what we 
up falling back on rather than does the truthseeking exercise think true or not is this heuristic of does 
who says things that have turned out to be correct tell me that there is a conspiracy afoot and 
so i guess just trust them based on whatever they say donald trump tells you the system is rigged 
system is rigged and then when he tells you that climate change is chinese hoax he is credible because 
was the only politician during the debates who would say the system was rigged and that part was true 
was gonna rig it more chuckle but he lying about that and i think that this epistemological crisis our 
to know whether something is true as opposed to what we believe in that this more than anything is 
for the fragmentation in our beliefs and we focus too much on the fire and not nearly enough on 
kindling piled up all around the base of the trees sc but where does it fundamentally come from what 
the difference between now and fifty years ago in this is it just because the ways that we got 
information is different or is it cd no i think monopolies and i think inequality i think it actually 
the same root as going on on the internet that if you wanna look at it through thomas lens 
the capital in the twentyfirst century you have a period through most of the world in which the share 
wealth owned by the richest was very high and the share of wealth owned by everyone else is very 
there were a couple of events that ended up rebalancing that temporarily the french revolution was one manumission in 
was another one the majority of wealth on national balance sheet was in enslaved africans the conversion of enslaved 
in law from assets to humans wiped a substantial fraction of the gross national wealth off the books and 
the majority of that wealth was held in a few hands you ended up with a much more equal 
and much more equal nation one of the most equal in the history of the world and that what 
after that is a period of enormous growth and pluralism by no means perfect reconstruction jim crow are obviously 
pluralistic policies but the policies overall compared to the precivil war policies are much more pluralistic and inclusive and 
part because the rich people have as much money and so they spare as much to affect policy outcomes 
and the other thing piketty says is that over time wealth concentrates that even in fastgrowing dynamic economies everything 
being equal rich people get richer and he has this great parable where he contrasts the fortunes of bill 
microsoft founder with liliane bettencourt the heiress of the fortune richest woman on earth never done a work in 
life with bill gates investor so after bill gates quit microsoft he had an equally long career as a 
plumber moving money around as opposed to making things that people needed and bill fortune over the period in 
he founded this most successful company in the history of the world grew more slowly than liliane fortune so 
new money in liliane bank account over the same period as someone who did nothing but owned assets were 
than bill fortune but bill fortune as an investor grew by more than either so just being someone who 
things will always all other things being equal make you richer even than people who do things that make 
of our lives better cd and so over time wealth begins to concentrate so you have a bunch of 
that make wealth more equal and then wealth concentrates and concentrates and one of the things about concentrated wealth 
intrinsically unstable because you follow policy to places that are good for society instead you have to follow policy 
creates parochial benefit for rich people and that over time that policy debt manifests in political instability which creates 
or wars or other kinds of crises or catastrophes in view the big one was world war i the 
period and world war ii which was the largest capital destruction in the history of the world because the 
prior to that had been held in so few hands per force the majority capital destroyed belonged to rich 
sc rich people yeah cd they were the only people who had any money and then you have what 
french called the thirty glorious years les temps glorieuses the creation of the welfare state the most prosperous period 
human history and over time you also have an accumulation of wealth the rich are getting richer by the 
share of wealth owned by the top decile has reached a tipping point and you start to see the 
that elect reagan that dismantle progressive taxation that dismantle redistributive policies that limit intergenerational wealth transfer like inheritance taxes 
start to see the dismantling of antitrust protection of labor protections all of the things that are pluralistic and 
public good in favor of private good for an increasingly small cohort of increasingly wealthy and powerful people sc 
how does this lead to the antivax movement missing cd well it creates industries that only have four or 
players sc okay cd that have so much money that when the fda is considering what to do chances 
everyone working at the fda in a decisionmaking role used to work for one of those companies and those 
have a lot of money to spend lobbying the fda the same way you get the network discrimination policies 
ajit pai it was one of the most expensive regulatory adventures in the history of any industry killing net 
and it was only possible because comcast had cornered these monopolies and att had cornered these monopolies where they 
up america and said will serve here and you will serve there and we compete with each other make 
money by charging more for delivering less and systematically under investing in infrastructure pocketing money intended for infrastructure buildout 
rural places and underserved places without delivering that either and we will use some of that surplus capital most 
it will go to our shareholders but use some of that surplus capital to continue to lobby for even 
lax rules that benefit us more at the public expense that at its core is just truthseeking exercises option 
it means to influence policy for parochial rather than public benefit is to turn the truthseeking exercise into an 
cd a really good example of this that makes it super obvious that truthseeking can become auctions is in 
virginia and we think of west virginia as coal country actually chemical processing country the major industry there is 
processing and because of monopolization one company is larger than all the rest put together and dow chemicals so 
the chemical industry lobbies west virginia dow lobbying them so the chemical lobby group lobbied the state of west 
for variances in the national limits on how much toxic runoff from chemical processing could enter the drinking water 
and they argued that the national levels were too restrictive and that west virginia could have less restrictive rules 
they argued for that on the basis that the national levels were set based on the national bmi and 
west virginians chuckle are so much fatter that the poison would become more dilute in their tissues sc they 
soak up more poison yeah cd and that also west virginians hardly drink water this was their basis for 
this now a californian you remember before we had recreational marijuana we had medical marijuana and in theory you 
only get medical marijuana if you had a condition that demanded it but in practice there was a box 
the form that you were supposed to write depression or trouble sleeping or glaucoma sc the promise cd and 
they would hand you the medical marijuana card the actions of dow chemical and their lobby in west virginia 
the actions of a company that knows that they need a good reason they just need a reason they 
could have my daughter i was helping her with her math homework last night one of the questions was 
whether y equals x squared would produce this point on a line and explain your and she said because 
said right sc well reasoning yeah cd if it is the action of a firm that understands that a 
exercise is all they need us to say i said and that is reason enough sc and but just 
it super duper clear in one part of the story the monopoly power leads to corporations or interests that 
to promulgate a line of truth but also a reaction against it because you know who to believe anymore 
cd sure sc so no big corporation that is promoting antivax but it becomes an epistemologically respectable position if 
believe anything you hear cd sure yeah it what we have to fall back on is someone who sounds 
rather than a process that is legitimate and someone who sounds trustworthy can be someone who tells you a 
thing and then says a bunch of false things i once had a meeting with this guy david allen 
wrote this great productivity book called things a really good book and i read it and it helped me 
a lot more things done how to use cool checklists to manage your time and i said do you 
that core method how did you develop and he said well i took all the best stuff from laughter 
because when they make you a scientologist the first thing they do is teacher a bunch of stuff that 
and then they start sucking money out of your wallet right you know con artist they call this putting 
on the send so when you fall under the spell of a con artist the first thing they do 
pay you right they get you to participate in a scam where you win and they say now that 
see that the scam works gonna put you on the send go home cash out your college fund get 
second mortgage and empty your and come back and do it so this is putting you on the send 
donald j trump says the system is rigged you go like sc it kind of is rigged cd is 
cd yeah and then he puts you on the send and he says change is a chinese hoax and 
and the fact that told you one true thing makes the other things more credible like douglas adams and 
towel right if in the guide to the galaxy if you have a towel people will go if got 
towel he must be really laughter cd and then if you say lost my toothbrush and my soap and 
shampoo and my backpack and my rail give you everything else because got the towel sc you have that 
so is there a strategy at the individual level for dealing with this world in where harder to know 
to trust cd i think that ultimately that is the great crisis right sc yeah cd that without that 
is very hard to know what to do and when to trust someone and i evaluate all the truth 
that i need to get on the right side in order to survive and thrive to know whether or 
the index fund that my is in is being run by grifters and to know whether or not the 
core curriculum that my daughter is going through is gonna prepare her adequately for life all of those things 
i personally sc medical care cd medical care yeah all of that stuff a canadian and so medical insurance 
freaks me out and when we got medical coverage here we let my employer talk us into getting a 
savings account which turns out to be the biggest scam in the world right laughter cd and i was 
way you describe it sounds and when i google it and i get a bunch of contradictory things all 
know is that last year we put thousands of dollars into this thing that they then clawed back on 
but what do you mean i was saving that in case i needed a hip laughter cd so the 
can do very little except band together with other individuals to lobby for structural changes we can muddle by 
best as we can in the same i have colleagues in the digital human rights world who talk about 
as a way of defending human rights they say if you can keep secrets from powerful states then you 
keep them from knowing who you are and what you do and using that to punish and an element 
truth to that but defenders have a harder time than attackers right eventually you will make a mistake right 
state that wants to survey you can afford to have three shifts of agents watching everything you do whereas 
you get to hour eight and got sand in your eyes and seeing double and tired and hangry and 
dumb mistakes you get to rotate another you on to make sure that you never recycle a password or 
a firmware blob without doublechecking the hash of it or any of the other things that you need to 
to have perfect operational security so for me the role of cryptography is not to create a kind of 
demimonde that lives alongside an unaccountable illegitimate state cd to create a kind of temporary shelter that we can 
under while we organize to make the state more accountable and legitimate that ultimately all of us are vulnerable 
called rubberhose cryptanalysis right your cipher may be so strong that all the computers in the every hydrogen in 
universe turn into a computer guessing what your password is or your passphrase is would run out of universe 
you ran out of passphrase combinations but if someone can tie you to a chair and hit you with 
rubber hose until you tell them the passphrase it matter sc right cd so what you need is not 
cryptography but you need the rule of law you need for it to be illegal for your government to 
you and tie you to a chair and hit you with a rubber hose now cryptography can help you 
yourself against a legitimate state to organize to make that law a reality but not forever right and so 
there is no substitute for the legal code that sits alongside the technological code sc and does that help 
only that i want to be right and difficult to know who to trust but i want other people 
be right too and i necessarily trust that the typical median voter for example is trying that hard even 
be right what are the systematic strategies we can use just to share truth more widely throughout our society 
so i would disagree with that characterization sc okay cd there are some people who are on the sidelines 
some of these questions people who might feel strongly one way or another about vaccines but they do what 
doctor tells them but you will be hardpressed to find a casual antivaxxer antivaxxers antivaxxers because they care about 
truth antivaxxers to harden that position requires really deep effort right a lot more energy than most of us 
into most of the technical aspects of our lives to be an antivaxxer if you think about vaccines as 
just one of the many health interventions that are made in your life over the course of your life 
be really into it i mean nerdy right like being really really really differential transmissions or something not just 
cars but into a really specific kind of spark plug and so not that those people care about the 
that wrong and the method by which they determine the truth is flawed which is why wrong but not 
they lack fervor to discover the truth sc so giving them better ways to figure out what the truth 
is the biggest part of cd creating legitimate systems that we can point at and trust sometimes people would 
on about the and its complacency and the time in which everyone trusted their government even as their government 
engaged in dirty wars in south asia or postwar reconstruction colonialism in the pacific rim or whatever but the 
of the state is a very important asset for a functional society illegitimate states create lowtrust societies that are 
and that are incoherent in how they arrive at the truth we hear a lot about russian interference and 
think that overstated if for no other reason than if a basket case failed state like russia can tip 
over into a chaotic world like the one we live in then our world was more fragile than it 
have sc right cd our state was more fragile than it should have been but one thing that guides 
oligarchic movement in russia is a media strategy that is centered around making it hard to know what the 
is not just about pushing an alternate line of truth but to making the truth itself seem unattainable so 
strategist cheerfully admits that some of the opposition groups in russia are ones that secretly funding and that planning 
provoke towards sc more noise more confrontation and more controversy cd but he tell you which ones sc yeah 
course cd and this is why it is worrisome to think that maybe black lives matter groups on facebook 
of them were not legitimate or were insincere whatever it is facebook calls them because it means that everybody 
to wonder whether or not the group that sc is this one legit cd is legit very destabilizing to 
power of collective action and so having a legitimate state a state that is accountable and transparent and legitimate 
pluralistic no substitute for it and once you have that state and then you start to abuse it you 
coast for a while but eventually a crisis builds up and where arrived at sc well like to reaching 
end of our time a little bit here cd sure sc like to end on an optimistic note cd 
sc not succeeding right now what cd no i have an optimistic note for you sc yeah the optimistic 
cd so a copyright scholar called james boyle who runs the duke center for the public domain with jennifer 
and jamie wrote a book called the public domain where he talks about information politics by means of the 
of environmental politics and he says that before the term ecology was coined and came into widespread use you 
people who cared about whales and you had like people who cared about fresh air and you had people 
cared about tailpipe emissions and you have people who cared about the ozone layer but they think of themselves 
all being part of one fight they thought of these as each of them as separate fights and the 
ecology welded them together into a movement it made every one of those causes aspects of the same fight 
even have another way to describe it except to call it an ecological fight and that is what is 
millions of people in the streets the people who care about climate change some of them care about it 
they care about drinking water and some of them care about it because they care about natural habitats and 
on and so on but all together because they all agree that these are facets of the same struggle 
while inequality and monopolies and corruption have produced constituents from so many different domains for pluralistic reform so one 
that makes all the eyewear ever heard of called luxottica they bought every single eyewear brand first they bought 
the major retailers sunglass hut and sears optical and target optical and lenscrafters and then they refuse to carry 
eyewear brand that sell to them until they drove them to their knees and picked them up for pennies 
literally if got any of the major eyewear brands luxottica and if you bought from any of the major 
luxottica and if your lenses came from slr which is the largest lens manufacturer in the world they came 
luxottica and if your eye insurer is eyemed which is the largest insurer in america also luxottica and raised 
a in ten years cd and so there are a bunch of people who wear glasses who care about 
and monopoly but there used to be thirty wrestling leagues and now one and owned by this billionaire trump 
called vince mcmahon he reclassified all the wrestlers as contractors took away their health care dropping down in their 
gofundme is full of famous wrestlers begging their fans for money to pay their medical bills so if a 
fan with the eyewear people cd now there are three talent agencies left in hollywood and all of the 
fired all of their agents because the talent agencies are now all owned by private equity funds and those 
equity funds have decided that to increase their return on investment that the agencies are gonna start doing called 
where they package a writer and a director and a whatever and they collect a fee from the studio 
that package and in exchange they agree to take less money for each of their clients and so every 
in hollywood is there for you to fight for wrestlers and eyewear cd and then technologists who care about 
web only having five general websites filled with screenshots from the other four and people who work in the 
sector and people who work in finance so the whistleblowers who got fired for refusing to help wells fargo 
their customers and then the two million customers that wells fargo defrauded so over and over again this is 
eleventh anniversary of the bail out everyone pissed off because their house was stolen by a mortgage issuer who 
robosigning to forge the documents needed to steal their house is there for you on this corruption fight they 
know it cd so we are on the verge of going from denial to nihilism of of that peak 
are on the verge of having a potential mass movement and our job is going from convincing people that 
problem to convincing them that not too late to do something about it and our political discourse is shifting 
fast these issues are bubbling up in all the major parties the rightwing has suddenly discovered antitrust because for 
and years okay with it because their paymasters were getting rich from it and then one day they woke 
and they realized that if five tech executives decided they like them that they disappeared from the internet and 
from our public discourse and all of a sudden tucker carlson is sounding like brandice chuckle sc yeah cd 
so not saying first they came for the nazis and i did nothing i a nazi and then they 
for me saying first they came for the trans activists and then they came for the pipeline activists and 
they came for the sex workers and then they came for all kinds of people that i cared about 
we did nothing now they finally came for the nazis and tucker carlson wants to do something maybe we 
get something done and my colleague at eff jillian york is the person who tipped me off to this 
so right about it and so we are really on the verge of a moment in which everybody figures 
that this is the issue of our day that climate change denial and vaccine denial and bridges falling down 
infrastructure under investment and the racist policies that have created the refugee crisis in central america that all of 
are aspects of corruption and that we are all on the same side when it comes to fighting corruption 
for a tiny minority of billionaires who are themselves increasingly of the opinion that they need to find expensive 
to hide in when people start building guillotines on their lawn sc i an interesting perspective because when you 
to cast the political battle as soak the rich and decrease inequality people who think maybe i will be 
some but if you say break up monopolies and decrease corruption very few people think of themselves as future 
cd yeah right and yes temporarily embarrassed millionaire have always been a problem in american politics as have what 
left called bootleggers sometimes the people who are like there are social betters we should just let elon musk 
on with it because iron man is the but yeah nobody idolizes monopolists except for peter thiel who will 
you that monopolies are efficient because competition just wastes so much resource why we just have our wise philosopher 
sc plato i was just gonna say plato said the same thing about democracy anyway plenty to think about 
doctorow thanks so much for being on the podcast cd my pleasure thank you music excellent interview run across 
in past podcasts but this is the first in depth interview heard and i really enjoyed the level at 
he has thought about the issues you discussed his clarity of thought made it all the more enjoyable inspired 
go do a deep dive into whatever doctorow content i can find great conversation but cory was wrong about 
he confused them with where the money set aside is lost at the end of the year given the 
matter i found it ironic that this piece of misinformation on his part threw into question the rest of 
assertions he is quick to explain the unquestionably subjective and diverse motivations and understandings of people who voted for 
despite not being a trump supporter himself or even a mind reader perhaps he should consider that if he 
unable to get a basic fact straight about a healthcare option he may also be incorrect about other more 
matters i love the clarity of understanding and explanation from cory and all your guests i really love that 
come away from each episode with useful and perspectives on important things thank you for bringing us all these 
people and their ideas and for regularly asking can we do the optimistic mr doctoro has some interesting observations 
it seems to me that these things come and go martin luther marie antoinette carl marx the brits the 
etc in the end democracy and capitalism seem to be the best models we have and can only be 
through the rule of law equitably administered doctoro should be less concerned about microsoft and more concerned about a 
free press not referring to fox news also the cheap shot at tucker carlson of fox news suggesting he
