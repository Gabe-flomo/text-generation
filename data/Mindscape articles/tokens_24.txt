carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll if any of you have read 
book the big picture you know i make a big deal in there about different ways of talking about 
universe this is a very old idea been talked about in different ways itself as it were but the 
is that there is sort of a way of talking about the universe at the fundamental physical level or 
might talk about a wave function or quantum fields or something like that and then there are emergent levels 
top of that sort of a biological level with our cells and organs and so forth individual organisms kind 
a human level with psychology and even supra human levels where you talk about sociology or politics or economics 
whatever and everyone kind of agrees that those levels exist but the relationship between them can be a tricky 
in particular there can be a little bit of reluctance in some circles to think of human beings as 
that just obeys the laws of physics sc now on the other hand there is a tendency in other 
to what i would call overclaim the extent to which we should just think of ourselves as things obeying 
laws of physics in the sense that we should not abandon or modify the vocabulary of fundamental physics even 
we talk about individual people as i explained in the book you obviously need to have consistency between how 
talk about people and how we talk about particles but the vocabularies the ideas that we may use might 
very different nowhere does that become more obvious than in the discussions we have about free will and of 
there are different definitions of free will blah blah blah but regardless of your favorite definitions an interesting amount 
work to be done trying to establish how we should talk about people how we should think about them 
we should involve values and morals and ethics how we should punish them how we should assign praise and 
so today talking to jenann ismael a philosopher at columbia university about this exact problem sc about how to 
about human beings while accepting the fact that human beings are part of the physical world this is very 
in my wheelhouse in terms of interest not so much my wheelhouse in terms of expertise so a very 
conversation for people like me who care about connecting humanity to the fundamental laws of physics in some way 
last element of a trilogy in the last three podcasts had dan dennet and then sara imari walker and 
jenann and in the talk with dan we talked about the very general idea of connecting the scientific image 
the manifest image in the talk with sarah we did that in the case of life where is the 
line between nonlife and life how do you make those connections how do you make that transition so today 
some sense doing that with people how do you draw that difference between a person not a person what 
it matter to be a person all while respecting the rules laid down by the fundamental laws of physics 
i also wanna mention before we dive into the conversation that going to be traveling to australia and new 
at the end of february i usually mention my trips and talks and things like that on the podcast 
maybe i should do it more often so anyway end of february for those of you listening in the 
going to be in auckland brisbane sydney and melbourne giving some talks sponsored by think inc sadly not free 
i often go to australian and new zealand so this is a chance to see me if you wanna 
books you can do that if you wanna get books signed if you already have them you can do 
and you can look at the web page for think inc which is the organization putting on these talks 
for australia and there i am anyone down there who might be listening i hope to see you there 
this is gonna be a good conversation at the boundaries of physics and philosophy i think there are any 
boundaries i think a middle ground and solely where we are today so go music sc jenann ismael welcome 
the mindscape podcast jenann ismael thank you for having me sc so free will is a topic that people 
about a lot and everyone has an opinion about it right an amazing extent to which people have very 
opinions i worry a little bit that a lot of the debate comes down to definitions so i actually 
try to avoid talking about free will that much but you wrote a whole book about it was that 
a courageous act chuckle to dive into these waters where everyone has a preexisting opinion ji i think i 
go diving into the waters having a kind of dog in the fight about what i thought about it 
mean i think for me it comes out of the places kind of in our worldview especially a physicalist 
where clear something that we understand and i think for me thinking about free will it was sort of 
placeholder for that sense of agency that we have everybody even pretheoretically even before they decide on a definition 
what free will is supposed to be when presented with the fact of determinism feel shocked and in some 
offended and so clear that something in the concept of determinism that clashes even pretheoretically with our sense of 
we are and the way that we fit the cosmos and because not a moral psychologist not a philosopher 
already a dog in that fight i just felt like there was something clear that needed to be understood 
and relating it to physics is a is that what you do in the book ji relating it to 
yeah the reason for relating it to physics was because physics gives us a sort of regimented context both 
which we can raise the question in a precise form and then see about trying to address it sc 
i think so probably many listeners are familiar with the general landscape of arguments that on the one hand 
say look we have laws of physics impersonal we get to overrule them just a person not cartesian dualists 
therefore everything is determined no free and some other people who say but we can be compatiblists about laws 
physics and free will some emergent properties some higher these are things that i say in my own books 
just to spoil the end of the movie here why you situate yourself within that context a little bit 
then back up and try to fill things in ji okay i think i do i do think that 
certain kind of freedom is completely compatible with the laws of physics i tried not to get into this 
of positioning myself with respect to the philosophical landscape because what i tried to do in the book is 
understand and i believe and think that physics is gonna change our conceptions of what kinds of thing we 
and how we fit into the world so instead of starting with some definition of what free will is 
seeing whether physics matches that i try to understand what physics is telling us about ourselves and what sorts 
freedom if you think of yourself as a physical thing in the physical world you end up having without 
arguing that what sc have always meant ji have always meant or pretheoretically whether it fits our conceptions of 
by pretheoretically used this term it means before we think very hard ji yeah intuitively before you settle on 
view about what freedom would have to be sc right in the manifest image in the folk psychology or 
ji yeah before you get sophisticated sc okay but so you do want to i mean your title is 
makes us so not on the side that says no such thing as free will ji right although the 
of the book is ambiguous in all kinds of ways that are intended so for example how the way 
which physics makes us free so the specific kinds of freedom that physics gives us sc right so rather 
saying do or do we not have free will what does it mean to say or what does it 
to have or feel that we have this kind of ji in what kinds of right in what kinds 
ways do we have freedom if we conceive of ourselves as physical things in the physical world sc okay 
now everyone has made up their mind whether they agree with you or not already but still nevertheless fill 
in i did recently do podcasts both with ned hall where we talked a lot about possible worlds and 
little bit about causation and one with dan dennett where we talked a little bit about free will and 
like that but in both cases they were whirlwind tours of a lot of territory so this is our 
to dig in a little bit more so think that all the interesting things have been said people have 
thinking about these things so you have a very simple organization in your book where you sort of first 
about what it means to be a person to have a self compatible with the laws of physics and 
you start talking about what it means to have agency to be able to cause things and do things 
does that sound like a sensible organization for the discussion as well ji yes sc or we first talk 
the self okay good what does it mean to be a person to be a self to be an 
if we know that just a bunch of atoms obeying the standard model of particle physics ji right lots 
questions there chuckle ji i mean i think the thing that seems to me characteristic of the self is 
i take from original discussion so descartes says when he introduces the notion of the self into philosophical discourse 
the way that it appears today he says is this thing this eye whose existence is made known to 
in the every act of trying to deny that it so in a way what doing is saying not 
with any idea of what i am except that i am that thing whose existence i cannot myself and 
seems to be suggested if you start to peel apart the layers in the argument there that i is 
and foremost the owner of a reflexive consciousness so what i sc someone who thinks about themselves ji someone 
is able to entertain thoughts about themselves as the subject of thoughts sc yeah ji right so what i 
in the book is spend the first part of the book trying to understand how a consciousness of that 
arises so instead of starting out with a view of particles in the void and trying to say which 
or configurations of particles would answer to that description i started out with particles in the void and try 
come to some understanding at first of the emergence of complex systems and then the emergence of things like 
and then the emergence of the kinds of things that have the cognitive organization that allows them to think 
their own thoughts and think about themselves as the subject of thought and then that gets to be the 
within which we have the sort of that can raise questions about themselves and their place in the world 
ultimately questions about free will sc and so just so people get too distracted but your consciousness per se 
not your target here right not tackling the hard problem of consciousness ji no deliberately avoiding it sc good 
we would like to so okay good so particles in the void which is a poetic way of saying 
are things that obey the laws of physics and those things come together to make selfconscious creatures agents i 
what your favorite word is so okay indulge ourselves a little bit what do you say or think about 
actual process that that happens over time ji you mean about like in the long term evolutionary history of 
emergence of the self sc yeah ji so i mean in sc by the sorry for any question i 
please answer the most interesting version of the question that i was trying to ask fill in the gaps 
i necessarily mention yeah ji okay so a very potted sort of schematic view about how one might think 
the emergence of agents is we start out with systems sorry we start out with particles that band together 
selforganizing units eventually the units at least the ones that are selected for it have to do more complex 
that require them to do things like metabolize energy from the environment it turns out to be advantageous for 
systems like that systems that is to say that have to gather energy and metabolize it to be able 
gather information and track and control and track their own movements through the landscape turns out to it turns 
later that more and more sophisticated ways of gathering and utilizing information lead from very simple sorts of systems 
amoeba through things like worms through things like dogs and cats and ultimately to creatures like us who have 
very special kind of equipment specifically designed to process and gather large bodies of information put that information to 
in the service of guiding behavior sc patricia churchland once pointed out to me a recent paper from people 
are studying c elegans the little round worm the model system in biology were we know all the neurons 
still trying to figure out what good for what they do and the claim was this one neuron job 
at least half of its job was to distinguish self from other it basically told the little c elegans 
whether a certain force acting on it was exogenous or endogenous and the grandiose claim was that that was 
birth of selfawareness in creatures and whether or not specifically true the kind of explanation signing on to very 
scientificbased one ji exactly right i think for me a more kind of cognitivebased distinction the distinction between self 
world so minds like ours minds that is to say where a large part a large amount of the 
machinery is devoted specifically to processing and routing information are best described in cognitive terms that is using the 
theoretic vocabulary that comes naturally when describing minds and the process goes something like this we first in the 
of awareness is perceptual information the perception information contains a lot of information about us and our situation in 
environment we spend a lot of time or the brain spends a lot of cognitive energy separating the information 
the way the environment is on its own independently of us from information about the way in which situated 
the environment and that process of kind of separating self from world or better separating information about self from 
about the world is the process in which our notions of ourselves and our notions of the world does 
objective environment through which move get articulated and firmed up sc so do you in the process of writing 
book or just thinking about this and doing research how much biology literature do you read do you dig 
evolution and neuroscience and things like that is that relevant ji relevant for sure i do much of it 
the book the little potted history i told about the emergence of cells i mean a story biological through 
through the questions of what are selected for and the routes by which creatures like us developed entirely biology 
i tend to think for the reasons that i said that the more important and immediately relevant vocabulary for 
the kinds of creatures that we are in ways that we will recognize from a first person perspective is 
science and i tend to think the neuroscience is relevant but in evolutionary terms really our brains with the 
level the lowlevel neural processes in our brains such as they are were selected because they support the sort 
high level cognitive processing that they support and so i tend to think that more illuminating for my purposes 
talk about the cognitive processing and think of the low level neural processing description as falling into place sc 
the difference the distinction is neuroscience is really about the neurons and how they hook up whereas cognitive science 
more highlevel structures in the brain ji and specifically structures that are described in functional terms in terms of 
way that they route information sc okay but i guess my job since broadly sympathetic to what you say 
job for the purposes of this conversation is to channel the people who are not probably do a crappy 
at that but get it my best shot so just in terms of vocabulary in that potted history a 
bunch of things that creep in a bunch of atoms that are bumping into each other but then we 
using words like usefulness and purpose and stuff like that is there a philosophy problem associated with the legitimacy 
using those words ji so there is i mean one of one wants to start with the most austere 
description that one can and earn right to use notions like purpose by adding structure into that setting a 
history of people sort of illegitimately and uncritically employing words that one only earns sorry that have a proper 
only once got a mind forming intentions and so on in place and then using that to describe the 
of or the behaviors of atoms in the void or something farther down the biological phylogenetic scale so one 
to be very careful about that the right order in which to do things is to start with a 
austere nonpurposeladen vocabulary introduce notions of purpose as they become applicable so there are very stripped down notions purpose 
come into effect in applicability when you have systems that were selected and depend on doing things like getting 
and avoiding prey and you get more articulate notions as you get cognitive systems in place and even more 
and ultimately the ones that matter for the human being notions in place when you have creatures that are 
representing to themselves possible situations forming longterm goals and choosing between them on the basis of information and desires 
so on sc okay so i think that that helps understand the stages at which these different terms become 
but again be a little hardnosed and say is it even someone just say that using a vocabulary of 
is just giving in to illusions no purposes in the laws of physics so what legitimates using that at 
at a higher level ji so gonna take a leaf from your book and say there are no cats 
like i said on your side already laughter ji yeah no i mean there are no cats at the 
level sc there are no cats at the fundamental level ji in principle we could describe things all in 
of just the vocabulary that physics uses it be very illuminating and especially to the extent that the goal 
is to find structures and creatures that we recognize from a first person point of view as applicable to 
in our mental lives and our actions then we are gonna have to introduce that vocabulary at some stage 
right okay and even if we solve the problem of consciousness we still need a rough picture of going 
in our brains right ji of course sc you talked a lot about daniel views in the book and 
sort of agree with them largely but not entirely but what do we need to take from how the 
works to be able to have this discussion about agents making choices ji we need a broadly functional understanding 
the emergent processes that support things like decision so we need to be able to think of ourselves as 
information storing that information making decisions based on information none of that requires solving the problem of consciousness in 
sense that come into the philosophical literature and come to be known as the hard problem the hard problem 
specifically the residue left over after you give a complete functional description of the brain sc yeah so as 
as we know how to talk about the brain in terms of what it does pushing our bodies around 
making decisions and so forth we need to worry about niceties about the experience of the redness of red 
so forth right okay ji right yeah sc but the but an important insight here is that we are 
little homunculi not unified whether evolution or neuroscience or cognitive science or philosophy a lot of reasons to believe 
kind of a mess inside our brains kind of unruly a corporation is actually how you put it right 
right yeah so i think yes and no or yes but no so absolutely true that at the bottom 
not unified at all nothing in physics but particles made of collections of particles bound together in loose coalitions 
configurations we gain and lose them all the time and even when we look at the mind using cognitive 
at the bottom levels a bunch of sensory motor subsystems cobbled together to produce emergent behavior but what i 
in the book and what i think is correct and what i think is essential to having a concept 
self of the kind that we do there is a kind of late edition to this loose coalition of 
motor subsystems that has the structure of something like an executive board that collects the information and oversees and 
things like all things considered decisions about what to do and i think that when not just operating on 
basis of responding to hunger or appetites but actually taking all of our desires into account and making an 
judgment about what to do the there who yields the decision after taking all those things into account that 
me is a unified thing and its role is precisely to unify or to in some sense collectivize the 
of all of the lowlevel parts sc did i ever tell you about the time i took lsd ji 
laughter sc jennifer my wife wrote a book on the science of self and we were told that if 
really wanted she was told that if she really wants to understand the science of self she has to 
lsd and see how that affects yourself and she was told that the ego dissolves and so forth and 
is not there and so as a good scientist and husband i went along and we did this together 
we both agreed at the end of the day still an still some final maybe not decisionmaking process too 
but like you said an executive board like the editor who puts the different drafts together in language ji 
yeah yeah exactly right i think for me things like a jury are a good module so in some 
if you walk into a jury room like a cacophony of different voices arguing and competing but when the 
issues a decision the decision is issued in the voice of the jury not in any one of the 
so absolutely true i think that if we reflect on what our mental lives are like a lot of 
as noisy and as unruly and as a jury with as little apparent unity as a jury but when 
issue a decision it comes from the jury as a whole as a body and i think the kind 
thing that we are we as subjects of decision and intention and so on sc and we are used 
this way of thinking all the time when it comes to corporations or nations or something like that we 
a nation made a decision even though a bunch of voices going on at the end of the day 
are passed or actions are taken ji right and let me point out that given the early questions that 
started with namely that the world ultimately dissolves into a bunch of little particles the notion of an organization 
exactly the right one in that we need to understand higher level emergent sorts of systems sc in what 
can you elaborate on that ji we are organizations of the bits of which matter is made sc okay 
yeah sc right ji so we are composed of those bits but those bits become us only when organized 
a very particular way sc i guess one of the arguments used by free will deflationists or whatever their 
is is if you could pinpoint where in the brain a decision was being made and understand that process 
in physics or in neuroscience or just in biology then we should stop calling it a decision being made 
some sense i guess the point of view that people who get very excited about experiments would take ji 
i even know what to say to that laughter that just sounds so absurd to me it seems to 
when you pinpoint that if there is a particular locus of decision that can be identified and i i 
no reason a priori to suppose that those processes completely distributed but if we could find a particular point 
locus of a decision it seems to me just identified the neural basis for decision sc right but i 
i totally agree but i would emphasize the philosophical importance of the move being made here just because we 
what we call the decision to something going on in the brain mean that the decision went away right 
right sc still there at that level of description is still the correct emergent higher level way of talking 
that a ji exactly right just found what the substructure of decision looks like at the neural level sc 
okay and just to sort of finish up the thread that i was pursuing earlier even vocabulary words like 
purpose like we said before these are our best ways of talking about what the self is doing in 
sense ji right yeah but as you said we wanna be very careful that we import those words before 
the right to use them so i think in so you talked about purpose before i think those do 
in a very natural way out of biology but notions like intention when used in the philosophical sense with 
s it imports a notion of meaning that involve normative conceptions of what counts and count as getting the 
meaning that are very difficult to understand strictly in biological terms there i think you need something like a 
environment so that leap from understanding purpose to understanding intention in this rich sense i think requires a little 
more than simply situating the biological self in the environment and understanding its kind of commerce with its environment 
can you maybe say more about the role of the social interactions there ji yeah so i know how 
more i can say that can be illuminating so when i talk about normative notions of meaning this means 
you can use vocabulary in a way that counts as right or wrong in a way that historically has 
very difficult to cash out simply in terms of functional interaction between a biological organism and the environment when 
put a system like us in a social environment and you have it communicating that is exchanging information with 
systems that have their own first personal point of view a lot more structure in that situation a lot 
structure to start thinking about things like getting it right and getting it wrong and using a meaning in 
sense that allows it to be passing intersubjectively that sort of setting i think brings with it new things 
just there with a biological or with a purely biological setting sc good so we seem to be getting 
picture where the self is emergent out of a noisy collective of individual biological things going on that individually 
not selves but come together to make us and yet some decision maker process anyway at the end of 
day that gives us an identity as something that makes choices so can we pinpoint at the exact stages 
which that vocabulary becomes useful like are cats selves are worms selves are bacteria selves ji so two different 
here one is the conceptual question about exactly what do we require when we think that in order for 
vocabulary to become applicable and then the empirical question about which of the animals along that spectrum exhibit those 
so much i started thinking about this i looked into the literature on animal cognition and just so much 
know sc a mess laughter ji yeah so i think the empirical sc why we should become physicists much 
than biology ji so much easier right right but i think there are empirical questions that we just know 
answer to and i certainly know the answer to as with the conceptual question it depends what you mean 
a self rudimentary notions of self that require anything like the formation of thoughts about oneself we can define 
identify them and those mark important transition points there are other important transition points that come later and i 
i prefer not to make choices about where exactly along those series of transitions the notion of the self 
applicable certainly for the purposes of understanding the kinds of selves we are the kinds of selves that possess 
cognitive equipment to entertain those cartesian thought i this thing whose existence is made known to me in the 
act of trying to deny that it exists those are plausibly only human sc okay ji not certain a 
that we know about higher animals especially things like whales and dolphins but it seems to be associated with 
whole cascade of capacities that do seem to be uniquely human so inclined to think that they are characteristically 
perhaps uniquely human sc but just so people get too excited by this not necessarily human you can imagine 
of course yeah of course sc nothing like a spiritually special about us in this point of view ji 
course yeah sc yeah but okay let gonna deviate from our topic here because this opens a little can 
worms that is still really really interesting i did a solo podcast on morality where i talked about well 
tried to come up with the moral viewpoints that i particularly had that would get the most disagreement from 
audience or at least from people who cared so one of them was on vegetarianism not a vegetarian but 
do have this strong feeling that nonvegetarians such as myself do a crappy job of giving a philosophically respectable 
of not being vegetarian like so the question in my mind is why is it bad to kill people 
okay to kill cows and eat them right i think sort of a necessary thing that everyone should have 
answer to if they eat meat ji i seem to remember talking to you about this the other sc 
i want to get you have the best most sophisticated decision procedure about what to eat and what not 
eat but ji as we were shoveling sc as we were eating ji yeah so i mean i can 
you my own story sc yeah please ji i was a vegetarian for about for twentyfour years sc okay 
and it was an article of david that turned me and it came actually though in the context of 
thought a lot about the self so i became a vegetarian when i was quite young for the reason 
i understand why it was okay to kill cows for example but not okay to kill humans having come 
a kind of relatively articulate understanding of what it was for there to be a self i read this 
by velleman in which he gives this argument almost in passing at the end of the piece that seemed 
right to me so tell you about the argument in a second but i wanna preface it by saying 
this is an argument that different in kind to kill cows than it is to kill human beings but 
in any way license you in making cows suffer sc sure no i made that very very clear suffering 
try to avoid that and a separate issue whether some moral imperative just not even to kill the cow 
right okay so a way of gonna speak in terms of the value of a life but i mean 
just in the economics sense adding up the kinds of value that there can be in a life for 
kinds of creatures any creature with a sort of experiential self one can surely one can count whether a 
the quality of a moment for that good or bad and you can count over any extended period the 
of the quality of moments or you can assess the value of that period in some way a function 
the quality of the moments that compose it but for creatures like us creatures that have a conception of 
past and their future creatures that represent to themselves goals and plans that extend over large periods of time 
just have a notion of the value of the life as a unit or longer periods in that life 
a matter of aggregating the quality of the moments in it ji in fact and i think this is 
right and this was point in the article we have a conception of the good of a life or 
good of some extended period of a life entirely orthogonal to the quality of the moments that compose it 
even people sometimes will take this point away from discussions like the ones that kahneman gives when distinguishing two 
of self he calls them the experiencing self and the remembering self sc this is daniel kahneman thinking fast 
slow ji right and got a beautiful ted talk on this but the way that kahneman spins it and 
gonna say this because gonna take it gonna disagree with kahneman here he says for example when you go 
a vacation the notion there is the quality of the vacation that you get by summing up how much 
enjoyed every moment of the vacation but then the story that you tell afterwards and the story you tell 
is in some sense dissociated from the quality of the moments you might have enjoyed every second just sitting 
the beach doing nothing but the kind of vacation that people tend to tell stories about and assess in 
kind of remembering way as the good vacations are the ones that are chockfull of activities and have all 
of things that they can tell people at a dinner party more than just sat on the beach for 
ji many of sorry many of which were not even that enjoyable when assessed in terms of the quality 
the moments that made them up so kahneman thinks that some sort or suggests in the way he speaks 
it that some sort of inauthenticity involved in evaluating from the point of view of the remembering self as 
retrospectively yeah ji yeah just telling a good story i think right i think going on there is that 
each do have these just two orthogonal dimensions of value and we are weighing them against one another every 
of our lives so when making a decision for example say a say you woke up this morning in 
york well not a beautiful day but a nice enough day ji you can do two things you can 
the day doing nothing much but wandering around maybe having a lazy afternoon in a cafe or you can 
some new york things the kinds of things that one is supposed to do in new york the kinds 
things exciting things you can tell people about afterwards or you can make a contribution to some sort of 
project those weigh against one another i think when an academic these sorts of conflicts come up you can 
on a book something that matters to you very much but gonna maximize the quality of the particular moments 
make up the day in that sense of that be individually enjoyable but you will be doing something that 
to you and something whose value has a different kind of value for you so i think for human 
we have these two relatively independent notions of value and that when we think about the value of a 
life or an extended period of a human life really that second dimension of value coming into play sc 
remind us which was the second ji the kind of value that has to do with plans and projects 
not with the intrinsic quality of the moments that sc right with keeping past and future in mind ji 
past and future in mind also the kind of value that when we think in terms of relationships there 
be some people that you enjoy sitting at a table with but also the kinds of relationships that span 
good period of time and part of the value of the relationship is that they have a certain kind 
past and they have a certain kind of future i think again those are notions of value that are 
some extent intention with an orthogonal to one another when a human being dies a human being invested a 
amount of time and a certain amount of energy in ongoing plans and projects and who has ongoing relationships 
so on a kind of loss involved in that not just the loss of more good moments sc right 
just the integral of all your happiness over time or whatever ji right and for other people a loss 
because they have invested a certain kind of continuing relationship with that person and the kind of loss not 
by having another person come in to the world collected over the course of our lives a very specific 
of experiences kind of thought about and contemplated squeezed out of those experiences a conception of who we are 
the things that we value and the things that we care about all of that is lost when a 
is lost in the world now arguably when it comes to cows and i would be willing to revise 
if we found out that cows have the kinds of minds that we did sc of course ji but 
the empirical hypothesis is right that cows really have that kind of a conception of their pasts and futures 
plans and projects a cow even do much in terms of carrying over information from one moment to the 
it just has experience it enjoys a good meal it enjoys a sunny day sc yeah no one is 
that cows can have a quality of life moment to moment that can be good or bad ji right 
on the presumption that all that their lives are like then i think the kind of loss that happens 
the world when a cow is killed is just that no more continuing experiences in that particular stream of 
or experience and that sort of loss is no worse than not bringing another cow into existence it is 
by the existence of other cows chuckle and so on so when people say the farming industry is responsible 
the lives of more cows than there would be without it exactly right true also sadly responsible for a 
of suffering but putting that aside i think there a reason not to kill a cow of the same 
that there is not to kill a person sc this is wonderful clearly i need to read this article 
wellman because i think what you just gave me is a much more careful and sophisticated version of what 
actually said in the podcast that and you reminded me of it when we were talking about intentions and 
and so forth somehow human the reason why bad to kill a human being is not just because their 
end but because they had plans for the future and they had memories of the past and you can 
again this is an empirical idea that could be overruled if we learn more about cows or or whatever 
you can reason counter factually with human beings you can imagine the future and you can say like not 
teach the dog not to do something but actually say if you do this tomorrow i will reward not 
way you can talk to the dog right and this ability to protect ourselves in the future is something 
as far as i can tell is unique to human beings and does draw a dividing line between the 
of a life of a human and an animal ji yeah and i think also to me equally important 
a certain way in which we are products of our past and carry our past with us and carry 
unique personal paths with us in ways that arguably and again this is an empirical question that other animals 
least some other animals and probably cows so a passage in death of ivan ilyich where ivan ilyich is 
and remembering going through memories and saying can i die when i of course this beautiful language but the 
that struck me where he says i die how can there not be something that remembers his ruffling skirts 
he was young in the and i think something really poignant about the fact that when we die the 
of very particular experiences and thoughts and not just the collection but the selection that somehow pulled together into 
own story of who we are and kind of rescued from the flotsam and jetsam of our own lives 
that will be gone and that be replaced to me who we are and a very special sort of 
i think sc good so this is a very worthwhile digression but okay trying to ji free will sc 
will putting the bow on this idea of where the self comes from and what it is so we 
between the self of a cat and the self of a human being or a cow ji actually can 
say one more thing sc sure ji it connects directly with what i just said i mean i think 
of the problem for understanding free will really is understanding how to get ourselves into the causal chain between 
and response and i think when people talk about free will and thinking in terms of well if you 
look at kind of the brain if you look at the physical landscape all you see are the causal 
passing through the brain you see any little homunculus you see any self entering in there sc no choices 
be made ji right i think what i just said about what the kinds of creatures we are the 
of minds that we have that we kind of collect and distill out of the things that happen to 
a body of beliefs and values and memories and so on i think that stuff is stored in the 
and that stuff when we make a decision comes to play this pivotal role and is brought to bear 
the pathways between stimulus and response and it comes to play the role of deciding whether to or play 
causal role of making a difference between whether we move left or right whether we do this rather than 
to me clue to understanding how it is that we get ourselves into the causal chain not something that 
see just by looking at the neural level processes in the brain you have to understand the information stored 
the brain and how that information was extracted from a very personal history of past experiences sc and does 
also help explain not just different between humans and cows but the difference between humans and computers could i 
a complicatedlooking computer that i personally could not predict the behavior of but nevertheless would not want to attribute 
will to ji well i go two ways on this i think not at all inconceivable that we would 
able to build computers that would have exactly this structure sc yeah not thinking sorry not thinking in principle 
we could do some day ji oh okay sc honestly on my computer i can write the program where 
able to predict what the outcome is going to be but probably my macintosh laptop is not gonna be 
to have free will just because i did that ji right no right yeah no internal decisionmaking process of 
kind that chooses its own goals and develops its own personality and so on from what you put into 
we are those kinds of things nature gives us inputs but we do have this self this role in 
and making our own selves and choosing goals and so on and values sc and some day we could 
a computer or an android that could also have those capabilities ji exactly yeah sc and from what you 
before i gather it would not necessarily be a bright line that gets crossed from not having those capabilities 
having them you sort of creep up on it ji i think so i mean i think there are 
there are all kinds of empirical questions about whether there is some threshold some kind of cognitive organization that 
does mark a kind of transition between for example prelinguistic and postlinguistic creatures and that seems to be a 
for good divide between these higher representational capacities that do seem to me to be required for things like 
decision choosing values sc okay alright well this has given a lot to think about we have the self 
the table did i leave anything out as far as the self is concern because i want to move 
to causality agency and choice ji nothing i can think of sc we can always come back great so 
with all that in mind good the classic argument which i think is not right against free will is 
based on determinism if everything is determined than our choices are determined not making those choices in some sense 
do we wanna spend two minutes putting aside the question of whether or not the laws of physics are 
or not ji sure sc are they chuckle ji probably not this is sc i think they probably are 
right ji yeah overlapping conversation sc as in many worlds are i think that they are why a hard 
yeah ji depends what you mean by determinism in part so i learn i follow you in all matters 
that kind but yes the question of how relevant that is to the debate about free will is probably 
one we wanna talk about here sc right probably just to say maybe the very quick version of it 
in newtonian physics physics was deterministic quantum mechanics brings that into question but whether or not quantum mechanics is 
has nothing to do with free will because not us making the quantum choices in any sense not that 
laws of physics are deterministic that there are impersonal laws that would be relevant to this question is that 
ji fair i mean i think what i said before about the trick is to get us into the 
chain this brings it out so if working in a newtonian regime one thinks that we make the decisions 
everything is determined by the initial conditions of the universe in a quantum regime in the context where people 
there really are indeterministic underlying events we it help to say that indeterministic underlying events together with the laws 
nature determine what we will do what we really need to understand is how sc we yeah ji determine 
and one way i put it sometimes if going to use words like i and we or you in 
sentence then then you have to stay using the vocabulary of people doing things you suddenly switch to a 
of electrons bumping into each other and obeying the laws of physics ji right sc okay good so determinism 
nondeterminism is not the question at all so much so that for the rest of the conversation we can 
pretend the world is deterministic at the fundamental level and still talk about whether nevertheless possible to make decisions 
have an effect on the world ji yes sc and a famous argument maybe this is a good place 
start the consequence argument against free will and you have a very nice summary of it in your book 
you can remember you wanna say what that is ji sure for philosophers listening to the podcast note that 
are much more complicated versions of it i like the very simplest one i think it gets the persuasive 
of the argument comes out most clearly the argument goes like this laws of nature to sorry ji if 
world is deterministic the laws of nature together with the initial conditions of the universe determine our actions logically 
our actions laws of nature are not under our control initial conditions of the universe are not under our 
therefore our actions are not under our control sc sounds pretty good sounds like a good argument like all 
the individual statements sound good and a valid conclusion right ji right sc so is the way to proceed 
say which of those premises going to disagree with or do you sorta wanna deny that a relevant way 
thinking at all ji so come to think something that i i noted in a footnote but emphasize at 
in the book come to think actually crucial to really seeing going wrong with the consequence argument sc by 
way anyone contemplating buying your book should know that in the middle of the book a chapter called appendix 
laughter so if you if you found some of the philosophical niceties in the first half of the book 
little bit too intimidating a nice summary in plain language which i thought was very very helpful ji i 
even parts of the chapters where if you have the stomach for it i signal that gonna be a 
bit of picky philosophy coming sc okay we mind that ji so you yeah you can get through it 
without having to slug through all of that but the point that come to think is really important is 
presents the consequence argument and in fact most discussions of free will speaking of entirely prerelativistic terms and so 
they say things usually the consequence argument just says the past together with the laws of nature determine how 
actually not true in the relevant sense when we translate it into a relativistic context and the reason is 
any given past or or the past of any given situated system even in a deterministic context does not 
as a matter of physical law determine anything that falls at even a finite fraction of a second into 
future and that can seem like maybe being a little picky because it turns out that what you need 
add in order to get something that fully as a matter of law determines the action are events that 
what are called the absolute elsewhere and it can sc outside the light cone ji outside the light cone 
it can seem like that just means that we know as a matter that we the situated agents know 
facts that are already in place but on their way to affecting us and such that if we knew 
they were or for any being that could determine what they were would determine our actions and i think 
the wrong way to think entirely that not to simply acknowledge that not true even in a deterministic context 
the past of any situated system determines its future and that no good sense in which those facts the 
that are needed to that need to be added in order to determine their future are already in place 
well but the past of the universe determines going to happen next ji when you say that what are 
thinking thinking that there is some point of view on the universe as a whole kind of all encompassing 
i am yes ji and by what right do you do that i mean i sc well certainly i 
it i have access to it right but from a eye view there would be the argument ji in 
terms there is no eye view sc there is no view okay yeah ji in literal terms there what 
is sc especially the people who usually deny the existence of free will want to admit that god is 
at the whole thing ji well and a little bit stronger so even if you think formally got to 
some constructible external dimension from which the past of the world is fully determined there is no global present 
the universe not even welldefined this external point of view is in some sense doing something very antirelativistic sc 
and not really moved by that to be honest because i can this is gonna get a little technical 
what relativity tells us is no unique way to divide spacetime into slices of constant time different people will 
it differently so what i want to say and maybe some sophisticated reason why i and tell me what 
is but what i wanna say is okay pick a way slice up the universe in two moments of 
i can imagine knowing what is going on on one slice of constant time one space like hypersurface as 
say and that determines everything inside its domain of dependence everything in its future and past that good enough 
what we wanna do here ji so it depends for the purposes of free will what one wants to 
is what lies in the causal past in a sense that can act as a constraint on your action 
whole force of the consequence argument people are thinking the past is fixed and beyond our control for those 
i think one ought to stick to the relativistically well defined path the things that possibly could constrain and 
are beyond your control and that can constrain and act causally as influences on your decisions sc but that 
that whether or not the consequence argument works is different in newtonian physics than in relativity ji good okay 
reason i started with the relativistic setting is i think a little easier to see going on in that 
sc okay ji i think it is still true in it is true sorry in a newtonian regime that 
can say there is a fact about the total state of the world whether or not we know it 
little complicated to unpack what i want to say about that in literal terms but i think what i 
put it very briefly not the case that ever in space and time a nomologically sufficient body of fact 
newtonian setting to determine what do before any collection of facts can be nomologically linked to an event or 
at some future time you need to add that there are no other facts or events in addition to 
that already accounted for sc gonna have to define the word nomologically for us ji nomologically means as a 
of physical law sc yeah okay ji okay so not the case that ever anything in the relevant sense 
a newtonian regime that is as a matter of physical law sufficient to determine an action at some future 
in order to get that you have to add this negative fact that there are no other facts in 
and the status of those kinds of negative facts which we probably go into a conversation about right now 
the thing i think on which you can hinge the denial that ever anything fixed and already in ever 
fixed and in place to determine an action as a matter of physical law sc okay i would a 
interesting argument that gonna have to think about but a different one than i expected you to give maybe 
because prejudiced by what my own argument is i would have said something like the premises of the consequence 
make perfect sense if demon if you could in principle know everything about the past and had perfect calculational 
but none of us is so the way that actual human beings get to actually talk about the world 
the information we actually have about it the laws of physics and the past do not determine the future 
not the kind of lawlike behavior we have access to in the macroscopic emergent world is that a family 
to what you said ji a family cousin except come to think that really important that sc okay ji 
even and clearest again in the relativistic context not even information that could in principle be accessed by a 
demon that would be sufficient to determine what you will do at some future time if that demon lies 
your own past sc yeah okay interesting i just say not demon so i and saying if you are 
not so a stronger argument certainly ji yes yeah a stronger argument sc okay and so is that it 
that your why the consequence argument work ji no what that does so a lot of this is ground 
sc yes ji it clears away the thing that people always want to say in these contexts whenever you 
up with the high level description that i think that you have emphasized and that i tried to give 
the book of what it is to make a decision and what that looks like through the lenses of 
people will very often and for the reasons that you say given the kind of information that we have 
so on that it makes sense to describe things at that level people hard liners will always come along 
say but in principle this microscopic description and what i just said is an argument to clear that away 
say a matter of physics not even and that places the emphasis where i think it should be for 
purposes of talking about processes like decision and understanding ourselves and so on namely on the high level processes 
you sc okay good ji and that i emphasize in the book sc so in some sense saying even 
i buy everything you want me to buy it still work ji it still work and work as a 
of physics i think the tenor of those arguments is very often you soft chuckle people just not understanding 
physics and the retort sc yeah did you say that to me true chuckle and i do understand the 
ji yeah chuckle sc okay alright so take that as at least i wanna not judgy here but that 
very straight i think a very understandable response to the consequence argument so where does that leave us what 
it mean given our previous discussion about what it means to be a self and have intentions and so 
do we need to do more work to understand what it means to make a choice what it means 
have a causal impact on the world ji yes so the notion of causation is one absolutely central to 
discussions so the way that i set it up in the book and which i really do think is 
for addressing the conversation as played out in the philosophical literature and probably in a lot of minds when 
first encounter the argument in public discussions people are importing causal notions into their understanding of the physics that 
some ways i think the physics itself employ those notions support the employment of those notions in that capacity 
important to talk people through the ways in which notions of physical law and notions like causation really do 
literal application in physics and i think what happens so say a little bit i think about what people 
thinking when they think of notions of natural necessity they have in mind causal notions borrowed from their experience 
pulling and pushing and yanking and they think that when you say that some event in the past or 
collection of events in the past or as in the consequence argument the past itself as a matter of 
law determines some event or some collection of events in the future is imagining that a sort of causal 
emanating from the initial conditions of the universe and pushing later events into place ji now as a matter 
just physical law and i know this is something that talked about on podcasts the physical laws themselves are 
time reversal invariant which means they have a builtin direction of determination if the past determines the future in 
deterministic context that newtonian mechanics provides just equally and in exactly the same way the future determines the past 
the notion of nomological or lawlike determination strong enough to get us the kind of asymmetric relation of determination 
we want sc causes precede effects ji yeah so people are thinking in causal terms importing those causal notions 
their understanding of physical law so illegitimate but look at the notion of causation then and see whether we 
understand in literal terms how causal notions get in and whether right to that our past causally determined our 
and there a lot of work to be done and i try to do it in the book a 
of extended notion of the ways in which causal notions have changed over the course of physical physics coming 
understand them sc it is weird to we talked to ned hall about causation a little bit writing a 
on causation right now amazing to me the extent to which this very simple kind of every day thing 
aristotle put at the center of everything two thousand five hundred years ago is something we still understand and 
because we know a lot more physics now and work to be done mapping the physics on to the 
wisdom or the manifest image but there were people like bertrand russell who said the best thing you do 
just get rid of the notion of cause and effect ji right sc and you and other people have 
going too ji yeah so the reason that russell said that was the one that i just pointed to 
together with a lot of collection of other niceties of the physics but the pretheoretic notion of cause the 
of cause the common sense brings to its understanding of the connections between events nothing like that if one 
looks at the fundamental equations of motion so why russell said we should push it aside with the advancing 
of science chuckle the sign of an image or a science if it uses notions like that sc we 
wish we could write like bertrand russell ji we do chuckle ji gosh yes but rightly many years later 
cartwright came along and pointed out that in fact the notion of cause is not dispensable for purposes of 
the difference between relations between events in particular correlations of a kind that are entailed by law that we 
use a strategic route to bringing about ends with ones that and absolutely central to understanding how it is 
we can intervene in and affect the world absolutely central to practical reasoning ji and so then that began 
long philosophical project of trying to recover from these time symmetric underlying laws together with auxiliary facts about the 
how it is that we can reimport causal notions into physics and something coming to focus more in a 
of revolution in causal thinking happened in the last years and really done a whole lot i think to 
respectable and to firm up and to separate from all of the phenomenological associations the notion of cause and 
it something that we can use in a firm and precise way in scientific context sc and i think 
lot of this whole discussion really involves again levels and emergence in the sense that we made a lot 
progress on fundamental physics and the image left with of fundamental physics is very very different than our image 
the everyday world and at least a little bit of temptation for people to say but fundamental physics is 
the language we should and others including i guess us and dan dennett and other people are saying no 
cartwright useful information in these patterns that we notice in the macroscopic world so sure you could be demon 
maybe you could be demon and make predictions but not only are none of us actually demon but nevertheless 
do not lack the ability to make predictions because there are emergent patterns that only work at the higher 
just not only wasteful but wrong to pretend that those patterns are no longer real ji in fact in 
cases the more illuminating ones and not just because simpler to use for constructing predictions but partly for reasons 
point back to what i was saying about the emergence of creatures like us in order to understand how 
world governed at the microphysical level by things like newtonian laws produces the kinds of systems that we are 
need to understand something like evolution and you need to understand that what evolution selects for is very often 
level processes so i think the more illuminating pattern is gonna be the one that pays attention to the 
of processes that the evolutionary mechanisms select for sc evolution care about atoms in some sense ji and if 
look around us the sorts of systems that we see around us a representative sample of the possible configurations 
atoms that you would get by recombining them in any which way very particular kinds of collections of them 
in order to understand why those ones exist and not others you need to understand what they do and 
yeah so true understanding ji yes exactly sc yeah okay so we have a vision of what selves are 
these messy things that have adapted to be able to have intentions and purposes and function in the world 
certain ways and we have a little bit of notion that it still makes sense to talk about having 
causal impact on the world is there a way in which we talk about the causal impact of selves 
do we conclude then at the end of the day human beings have causal effects on the world in 
ways than cows do and this is something that we can label freedom of choice ji is it okay 
i back up a little bit sc of course ji there is something that we say when we were 
about causation that i think needs to be said which is that this cleaned up notion of causation is 
very kind of permissive notion but one thing that it have builtinto it is the kind of notion of 
that comes from our every day notions of cause what it does is effectively if you take a set 
variables and you fix some of the gross constraints in the environment and you intervene on one of the 
the causal information is information about the effects that intervening on that variable has on the other variables in 
network so we can talk in a kind of way that is entirely neutral and crosses levels about one 
having a causal impact on another thing ji and i think when talking about freedom of the will really 
to understand how the kinds of voluntary behaviors or the kinds of intentions that we form can have a 
impact on the environment this notion of causation is very well suited to play that role but not different 
kind than the kind of causal impact that say a cow can have by kicking over a sc cows 
make things happen yeah ji cows can make things happen so i think when talking about free will specifically 
in the ways in which our intentions and decisions can impact the movements of things in the world sc 
and so i just wanna say elaborate on that chuckle what is special about intentions and decisions that distinguishes 
way a human being is talking from the way a cow acts ji okay so again gonna go back 
the earlier discussion so when i said that there is a way where you can look at any kind 
mind as just a part of the causal landscape that the causal paths pass through so i like to 
about because one of the models of the mind fairly well understood and discussed a lot in the biological 
think of a frog brain instead of a cow brain sc a frog okay ji so frogs have these 
welldeveloped evolutionarily beautifully designed mechanisms which are such that a certain kind of pattern hits its retina it will 
out its tongue because that kind of pattern typically indicates a passing fly and the tongue will snap it 
and bring it up and so some sense in which the behavior of the frog is a product of 
that it does but in another sense not because the brain has been designed in evolutionary time in order 
produce that response in the presence of the stimulus human minds are different for a lot of the reasons 
we said the things that we do simply a product of the ways in which the hard structure in 
heads was designed by evolutionary processes our minds were designed to be these sort of information sucks we pull 
information collected not over evolutionary time and built into the hard structure of our brains but over personal time 
built into the soft structure of our brains and when we make a decision those bodies of information and 
bits of information again that just been collected and made an impact or imprinted on our brains but have 
collected and sorted through and contemplated and from which extracted hopes and dreams and so on those are the 
that get brought to bear on behavior ji so i like to put it in terms of what goes 
in our minds in contradistinction to what goes on in a frog mind or possibly a cow mind generically 
characteristically in context when making decisions plays a pivotal role in what we end up doing and by that 
mean irrespective of what stimulus is what goes on in our minds is gonna make a difference to doing 
or doing b for a frog every time that kind of stimulus passes by gonna produce the same behavior 
gonna produce that behavior without any selfconscious rumination on its part sc i think this is a really really 
point i mean animals can learn things you can train rats to run mazes and so forth but all 
including human beings have impulses instincts natural things but maybe human beings have this unique ability to overwrite our 
impulses just by thinking about it just by cogitation or reflection or whatever not by necessarily being trained and 
changes what we mean when it comes to choice and free will ji right and it may be more 
a graded scale than is indicated in those brief remarks sc absolutely yeah ji we know things like that 
can construct maps of mazes and things like that so surely some kind of rudimentary information processing and something 
looks like decision and representation going on in the minds of all kinds of lower animals sc and does 
also help us understand the cases in free will discussions famous cases of people who had a brain tumor 
forced them to do something in a very predictable way that they just help it in some sense and 
it fair in those cases to say people have free will because they help but do that in a 
ji not with respect to those behaviors so where we exhibit our freedom in the most highly developed form 
in the context of decision when making deliberate choices and precisely because those are the kinds of cases that 
this whole machinery of bringing hopes and dreams and all of the things that you identify with from a 
personal point of view to bear we control the reflexes that our knees show sc no ji and so 
anything that bypasses those decision processes sc yeah we control our heart beats ji exactly sc plenty of noncontrolled 
exactly sc but then as long as there are some controlled things okay ji and controlled specifically by that 
decision level processes sc okay and i guess just to sort of wrap it up then clearly this whole 
has a relationship to questions of moral responsibility and blame and praise and things like that is it just 
onetoone correlation if to the extent that we have free will we have responsibility for our actions or is 
more subtle than that ji a lot more subtle sc always more subtle a rhetorical question laughter ji i 
this this but complex and subtle in a way that reflects the real complexity and subtlety of questions of 
responsibility so a feature of this kind of account rather than a bug that it recognizes that some extent 
which who we are is a product of the reflective processes but also true partly not and in many 
people really have the right opportunities to develop the kind of autonomous self that makes them responsible so all 
the cases that you think of as the great cases when thinking about moral responsibility people who had horrible 
impaired emotionally impaired cognitively in one way or another handicapped from really developing the sort of selfdetermination that one 
one needs those really are great cases i sc yeah people are far more tempted to say not their 
for some reason or another ji exactly exactly sc and perfectly valid that in some cases that would be 
not their fault and a hard ji or not wholly their fault sc yeah exactly right ji and in 
of the ways in which you feel yourself pulled two ways or probably ways in which the facts are 
in different directions sc do you is there an argument to be made that if you believe in free 
it would be hard to have discussions about morality and responsibility at all chuckle like after all if just 
by everything then how could you blame anybody for anything ji a hard one yeah i mean praise and 
blame my car when it do the thing i want it to do moral praise and blame sc moral 
yeah ji yeah moral praise and blame in a sense that licenses punishment again maybe there are social uses 
these things even if so even if you give a philosophical argument that something deserves to be praised or 
so i have a clear answer to those things above my pay grade sc fine but the rubber does 
the road in these philosophical discussions when it comes to legal questions who gets blamed who do we say 
had the ability to do otherwise that philosophical question is very very relevant to who we put in jail 
who we ji for some people some people might say irrelevant that the legal system is there to create 
and constraints that condition or keep other people from doing bad things irrespective of whether the people we punish 
it in that sc well maybe the safer thing to say is that people having those discussions would benefit 
a more nuanced philosophical understanding of the underlying chuckle ji absolutely yeah absolutely and because both of us and 
good thinking people think there is such a thing as free will then those discussions should be deeply steeped 
trying to understand the sorts of control that we have and cases where we fail to have that kind 
so i always like to end on an optimistic note to the extent that realistic given the subject matter 
you already mentioned the last twentyfive years or whatever a revolution in reasoning about causality clearly psychology cognitive science 
neuroscience are moving in an amazing speed and even philosophy i would argue is seeing a lot of progress 
you think that in these issues of the very broad program of connecting physics to our emergent every day 
making real progress and is the progress seeping out into the larger world ji for sure i think making 
i think this is really a kind of golden era for a genuine scientifically respectable naturalistic view of the 
being for a long time these sorts of naysayers and including people who present themselves as defenders of science 
say there is no such thing as free will just got to open our eyes and so on but 
think now there really is coming into focus a really plausible and persuasive view of the human being with 
of its enchantment and amazingness and so on is it seeping out into the wider world funny enough i 
probably seeping out into the public more quickly than it is into philosophy sc ahha i did not know 
okay ji which is still rooted in very traditional ways of thinking as the human being and thinking thinking 
enchantments in a way antiscientific sc the if i remember the survey that david chalmers did most philosophers classify 
as compatibilists when it comes to free will ji i think they do yeah i think right sc okay 
but still but saying in the general project of connecting the underlying scientific image to the every day life 
falling behind ji still falling behind sc still a little bit enchanted yeah alright well okay good good that 
room for progress otherwise we have anything to do ji exactly right sc a very optimistic message alright jenann 
thank you so much for choosing to be on the mindscape podcast ji thanks so much for having me 
a pleasure music wonderful conversation she was just brilliant making me look at things from a slightly but consequentially 
perspective will relisten on ethical vegetarianismveganism why only focus on the act of killing and ignore the extreme suffering 
is inflicted on animals as a neccessary part of intensive farming animals are confined in cages that allow them 
move castrated debeaked have their teeth and tails removed without anaesthetic babies are seperated from their mothers most of 
animals never go outside until being sent to slaughter and the slaughter itself involves a lot of fear and 
very often not painless even in the best circumstances animal products meet your ethical standards sure yes of course 
completely agree so sorry that clear i meant to emphasize what you are saying with the prefatory comment that 
argument that followed was only about killing suffering is wrong no matter what animals should not be made to 
and there are good arguments for veganismvegetarianism on exactly those grounds and others loved the podcast but it arrived 
me on overcast in uk so had to look elsewhere patreon supporter but since animals suffer why even argue 
a non existent reality just to provide cover for meat eaters further could we not also kill humans without 
just suddenly without their awareness they would not know they are losing their plans and life history and each 
plans are trivial in comparison to the entire humanity and time scales beyond the human life scale very interesting 
i wonder where can i find the argument that was mentioned got really curious about that article velleman article 
linked above excellent discussion there was a little hiccup when jenann talked about intensionality with an s which is 
kind of linguistic meaning that is revealed when we learn to our surprise that the morning star is the 
thing as the evening star one referent two intensions pretty sure sean asking about that only about intentionality with 
t in the middle no harm no foul though i get the appeal of denying that demon even makes 
sense but it seems like overkill to me the crucial point is that a physically viable judea pearl style 
of causality and counterfactuals is agnostic about direction in time take philosopher arif scenario of betting on the past 
my pocket says bob i have a slip of paper on which is written a proposition p you must 
between two bets bet one is a bet on p at for a stake of one dollar bet two 
a bet on p at for a stake of ten dollars before you choose whether to take bet one 
bet two i should tell you what p is it is the proposition that the past state of the 
was such as to correspond according to laws of nature to your action to take bet i edited the 
a little you take bet and win a dollar because although bob is a nice person rather you had 
dollar than him but also because you notice that if you had taken bet you would have lost a 
which is a conclusion licensed by structural equation modeling which is yet another point in favor of that framework 
which is a conclusion sufficient to torpedo the consequence argument i can plan far into the future my dog 
we drive up to my home where her dogs live knows where we are and anticipates playing with those 
one might say he plans to play with her dogs one might speculate that when we get into the 
he says to himself going to go or that he gets up up in the morning and says going 
go play when the day comes to an end he might think i go play with my friends i 
dogs morn the loss of a friend there is the case of red dog knowing his owner is gone 
walkabout looking for his friend fir months knowing somehow that he will look for his friend today tomorrow snd 
week i have come to believe that the primary difference between dogs cows people is language about the option 
being vegetarian the distinguished author argues that she understand as a child why it was ok killing cows and 
humans perhaps in a environment she was not able to understand it is ok allowed justified or not punishable

penalty self defense theories and practices in the grey area serving as a gourmet plate of the powerful is 
one example chimpanzees orangutans octopus cows dogs and more may be considered in the range of consciousness that may 
considered ethically an offense this is only a reminder of human auto delusion the pressure of economics and the 
that habbits die hard as will die hard the inherent vice of abusing of the which is a cornerstone 
our civilization it is time as steven spielberg has done with ai two thousand one movie or heinlein with 
the eighties of the latter century of thinking on how to avoid exploitation of artificial intelligence by our fellow 
it seems that we are putting yellow stars of david on any entity that may fall into the category 
a word congratulations good decisions or preferably love this one i like the recent discussions about the difference between 
physics principles and emergent mindconsciousness not a fan of the cow eating rationale but biased by the many other 
for not killing animals for food this was a brilliant discussion never heard of jenann before but she was 
have to check out her book also sean please do mention when be traveling on the podcast especially if 
overseas about the discussion of whether one may assign blame in a deterministic universe in such a universe the 
itself is determined down to the detailed movement of each air molecule carrying words from one person to another 
choice opinion all are names for highlevel structures which by definition of are immutable they have no meaning or 
for the people involved sean fine but the rubber does hit the road in these philosophical discussions when it 
to legal questions who gets blamed who do we say is had the ability to do otherwise that philosophical 
is very very relevant to who we put in jail and who we research suggests that many perhaps most 
believe we have what philosophers call the unconditional ability to do otherwise in an actual situation given all the 
and influences in play we could have chosen or acted otherwise and in a way up to us not 
philosopher thomas nadelhoffer has xphi publications coming out on this near as i can tell jenann advises that physical 
absolutely determine necessitate the next state of affairs demon is out of a job i suspect such indeterminism will 
used to buttress the claim that character is in a deep fundamental sense up to them they could have 
to be otherwise but failed to if they turned out to be bad characters their blameworthy fault not finally 
by upbringing genetics peers etc but of course indeterminism give an agent more selfauthorship diachronically or more control or 
in the moment but arguably less whatever the status of determinism our characters really are matters of genetics environment 
constitutive and present luck gregg caruso defense of the luck pincer why luck still undermines moral journal of information 
twentyeight jenann seem interested in defending desert which is good but the incoherence of libertarian conceptions of free will 
held by the folk if not philosophers needed more attention in this conversation and in the one with dennett 
to suggest that this conception helps drive our all too punitive policies on criminal justice and social inequality eg 
et al will and punishment a mechanistic view of human nature reduces psychological science v the argument to justify 
the consumption of animal meat seems very weak it first putting aside suffering put the debate in a very 
world second not being sure that animals have the of value that has to do with plans and should 
least make you think that maybe they do have it heard of the planning ravens right the more i 
about animal intelligence the less i see the fundamental difference with humans and the happier i am not to 
them hi sean when are you coming to germany we also want our books signed loved the episode as 
food of the gods book is a must read if you are interested in these types of topics i 
your podcasts sean but sometimes i wonder what your desired audience is if you want to reach the widest 
audience and it seems to me this is a really useful thing to do you could consider avoiding jargon 
like or big problem dan dennett did not explain this clearly or simply enough for demon with no explanation 
what this some things may be difficult to elaborate on however i wonder if other things might be easily 
with simpler terms like seems to mean if on the other hand you wish your podcasts to be understood 
those who already understand no problemo i have enjoyed your last speakers enormously azra raza was particularly engaging for 
a lot of what dan dennett said seemed quite unclear to me many thanks collected over the course of 
lives a very specific set of experiences kind of thought about and contemplated all of that is lost when 
person is lost in the world yes that gives me a kind of wistful sadness when i look at 
in old photographs especially good quality photographs that capture the details of faces then of course those are only 
photographed few a vast number of richly complete lives have been lived back into prehistory be suspicious when are 
arguments are invoked by humans to justify a moral stance in this case for animal killing sure sounds awfully 
lot like people are or religion is of past vs situations dressed up with a pseudo scientificphilosophical argument humans 
for the well maybe your into the future plans and a dogs into the future plans are equally insignificant 
universe time scale i would expect from sean being a moral constructivist to lay a different type of argument 
kill humans except in wars etc not because it is but because of the constraints imposed to our behavior 
from our frontal cortex by evolution so that there can be societies cooperation etc right and wrong ten commandments 
whatever are just the stories we tell each other to postjustify and reinforce these hardwired behaviors in broad social 
seems to me what ji is saying about the consequence argument is that it is not possible for to 
initial conditions not even for laplaces demon not even for god she believes that this is enough to dismiss 
consequence argument this bit was never explained sc muttered that it has something to do with the light cone 
never elaborated well if an event is outside our light cone it is unknowable to us but is also 
definition unable to influence anything in our light cone problem solved just because it is not possible to know 
things that go somewhere else in the universe it does not mean we cannot understand perfectly and predict what 
going on in our own light cone besides demon is only a thought experiment we can endow the demon 
any powers we want my version of the demon is capable of knowing everything everywhere i see no problem 
the consequence argument i listed to the part on the consequence argument twice and both times when sean ended 
sc think a very understandable response to the consequence argument i thought to myself that i had no idea 
they did away with the consequence argument the way it was presented was very clear and appealing to me 
if the world is deterministic the laws of nature together with the initial conditions of the universe determine our 
logically determine our actions laws of nature are not under our control initial conditions of the universe are not 
our control therefore our actions are not under our control from here not even sure how they are trying 
break it down the argument seems to reside in the following quotation from the show ji the reason is 
any given past or or the past of any given situated system even in a deterministic context does not 
as a matter of physical law determine anything that falls at even a finite fraction of a second into 
future and that can seem like maybe being a little picky because it turns out that what you need 
add in order to get something that fully as a matter of law determines the action are events that 
what are called the absolute elsewhere i have no idea what she is talking about the state of the 
at depend on the state of things at it seems like if what she said were true the past 
any given situated system even in a deterministic context does not actually as a matter of physical law determine 
that falls at even a finite fraction of a second into its future we would not have been able 
send a man to the moon let alone make any accurate prediction about the world she just claims that 
is true and sean goes on to talk about a light cone or something can someone enlighten me on 
maybe with a concrete example of how the past and the laws of physics together lead to the future 
use indeterminate quantum processes as the example because we have any over those either thanks rob in a relativistic 
the light cone divides spacetime at every point p into three disjoint sets the future light cone which contains 
of the points that can be effected by what happens at p the past light cone which contains all 
the points that can effect what happens at p these are the only welldefined ie invariant notions of past 
future in a relativistic setting the third set is comprised of points in the absolute elsewhere which can neither 
nor be effected by what happens at p and that have a welldefined temporal relationship to p for every 
in the absolute elsewhere of p there is a reference frame in which it happens before p and a 
frame in which it happens after the physical claim was that even in a deterministic setting the causal past 
any point p does not as a matter of physical law determine its future whether and how that helps 
the consequence argument and more general discussion of free will is a much longer conversation and not one that 
talked about i hope that is helpful to clarify the physical claim at least we would need more than 
quick conversation to sort out the philosophical one and i think sean and i might disagree here thanks ji 
getting back to us on this but i am sorry to say that i am no further ahead you 
the physical claim was that even in a deterministic setting the causal past of any point p does not 
a matter of physical law determine its this sentence seems to contradict itself if the cannot determine the future 
cause it the i am obviously missing something big here if the decisions are made not just based on 
triggers but also based on personal experience it just mean more data and more computation but the process still 
be automated in the age of smartphones and neural networks it hard to imagine a totalitarian state that surveils 
citizens from birth to death twentyfour hours a day and predicts their behavior and controls them with high precision 
challenging future for free will so is the idea that the past does not cause the future which our 
models of lots of things would suggest but that our does that seems much less likely than living in 
world of cause and effect dr ismael the issues seem straight forward to me but i know that that 
a great deal in your philosophy that i understand and i am willing to bite the bullet i have 
your book and am working my way through the consequence argument time and causation i am learning a lot 
have not read anything yet to convince me that there is any place in the universe for free will 
will keep you posted let me explain why i have problems with free will if free will exists ie 
humans can behave in ways that are not predictable then there can never be a science of human behavior 
study anything scientifically you must be able to falsify a theory this is done by making a prediction and 
testing to see if the prediction is correct if not you must go back and modify the theory free 
makes this impossible because it renders human behavior if nonhumans do not have free will it will be possible 
use the scientific method to study the behavior of nonhuman animals but science will be shut out of the 
of human behavior well grateful that everybody else came here with my objection to the argument on killing socalled 
animals quite unselfconsciously deplorable on its own alloof underscores the failure to take seriously what is or may be 
stake many species exhibit behavior which might be interpreted as mourning celebration altruism etc while human beings exist who 
not with regard to lsd anecdote i suggest he and his wife may have had either incomplete or incorrect 
or simply did not take an adequate dose with appropriate set and setting possibly all of the above lsd 
eradicated self in my experiencenor do i imagine that self is confined to the receptors on which it acts 
various mdt analogs might be better suited to the purpose of shortterm eradication of more fruitful still might be 
more scientific examination during a tenday introductory course of vipassana meditation i always wonder if the thinkers in these 
have made some approach to the very root of the mind body phenomenon lastly is there replicated neuroscience demonstration 
uphold contention that memory or even mind is confined to the brain thank you both for what is in 
ways a useful and interesting investigation of the consciously selfreflective particles in the void really great discussion i would 
say that cows and especially sheep are domesticated animals that have had their natural instincts modified try killing a 
animal up close and personal and you might find they have all sorts of life experience to remember and 
perhaps the shared mammalian experience of having emotions is relevant to the conversation as well anyway my feeling is 
killing millions of animals daily for our use results in a world where millions of beings are intentionally killed 
and a psychicspiritual price to pay for that whether we realize it or not and that this is not 
our benefit bill mckim january two thousand twenty at am i think the idea is that your future is 
by a larger lightcone than what is currently in your past lightcone to predict what you will do at 
demon would at least have to know things that are happening in your reference frame eighteen million kilometers away 
you sorry my response is so late i guess i just wanted the demon to have to go really 
afield to predict it thanks for another great discussion sean i do worry about the human exceptionalism which is 
accepted uncritically throughout this conversation in terms of killing animals for palatal pleasure i think the best way for 
to have an honest constructive discussion about it is to have a vegan on and debate properly notice that 
a vegetarian is not an ethical but rather a dietary choice so we cannot say that someone who has 
vegetarian now eating meat has changed her actions on animal cruelty therefore whether vegetarian or meateater the conversation tends 
merely reinforce each bias without challenging some of the fundamental assumptions which we use in order to rationalize animal 
consumption the problem with the capacity approach have capacity x which animals lack therefore human are morally permitted to 
is that it quickly becomes very hyperbolic detached from empirical evidence as some of the other commenters have pointed 
moreover it invites the thought that if a human being lacks capacity x it is morally permitted to kill 
human being moreover the specific capacity evoked by velleman and ismael here seems irrelevant as to whether we are 
permitted to kill animals consider the arguments vegans make based on observational evidence in all relevant respects cows pigs 
and sheep most likely share the emotional capacity to feel pain care for their kin and refuse to die 
we humans do finally we need to be careful not to try and justify an action as serious as 
and impregnating animals based not on evidence but on hyperbole or sheer ignorance is not enough evidence that convinces 
that they have capacity x capacity x is my subjective criterion for deciding whether they get to live a 
life therefore i am justified to exploitkill imagine the same reasoning used in court cases jury is not convinced 
on available evidence that the suspect did not do crime x therefore the suspect is yet this is exactly 
we sentence billions of land animals to death and pay others to do the dirty work of killing them 
the slaughterhouse floor so to sum up i strongly encourage you to have a wellinformed vegan on to discuss 
issues paul torek january two thousand twenty at pm thank you paul for the attempted clarification i guess i 
not understand light cones as well as i might i have been struggling through book and am unable to 
the enlightenment promised but i shall persevere in the meantime let me just say why i find her arguments 
puzzling i believe what she is saying completely invalidates the possibility of relying on science to investigate the universe 
just human behavior the best definition of the scientific method and what makes scientific inquiry by far the most 
way of knowing was given to us by karl popper he pointed out that science cannot proceed unless it 
possible to falsify predictions this means that if stuff is going on in the universe that is inherently as 
argues at great length then it is not possible to test any scientific theory or hypothesis the consequence argument 
presumed for all areas of physics without it it would make no sense to search for the higgs boson 
without the consequence argument its existence would prove nothing oh and about cannot dispense with it or make exceptions 
it and then argue that and in the human brain can anything simply does not work you simply have 
come down on one side or another great show and a great guest but way to put aside the 
important part on the ethics of consuming animals suffering and side step the problem like a wise man once 
to sam harris just admit it and feel liberated or words to that effect excited to see you in
