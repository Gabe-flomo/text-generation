and welcome to hope having a good new year so far like to start a tradition of starting off 
calendar year with a bang podcast wise last year to begin we had sir roger penrose one of the 
famous scientists in the public sphere but also someone who is enormously respected by his professional colleagues so this 
in two thousand twenty gonna start off with daniel dennett who is a philosopher who is as well known 
any philosopher is in the modern age among the general public and also once again extraordinarily respected among his 
colleagues i in particular have enormous respect for what dan has done and part of it is just that 
attitudes are very similar our approaches to what we do are very similar it would not be completely wrong 
say that when i am in a more philosophical mode trying to do for physics what dan has been 
to do for biology and neuroscience and consciousness over the course of his career as talk about in the 
we go a long podcast a long episode we cover an enormous amount of ground so individual topics are 
through very quickly but a theme a framework that ties it all together which is this idea of taking 
science teaches us about the world and connecting it to the world of our every day experience sc for 
science teaches us it is very often going to be the case that even though it comes ultimately from 
experience of the world the ultimate theories that we end up building might seem very different very surprising even 
the big bang cosmology quantum mechanics darwinian evolution are things that you have just guessed just on the basis 
your everyday experience without enormous amounts of observation and experimentation into realms that you see in your everyday life 
therefore the theoretical frameworks you develop sound or feel much like our every day world this is especially noticeable 
it comes to things like consciousness free will the nature of human beings so what dan dennett has devoted 
career to are taking discoveries from science whether neuroscience or biology or what have you computer science artificial intelligence 
teasing out their philosophical implications he is one of the leading philosophical naturalists not a naturalist in the sense 
going out into the forest and poking around the trees and the animals but a naturalist in the sense 
not being a super naturalist an ontology that says there is only the natural world so how do you 
explain things like purposes and meanings and other things that we human beings naturally associate with our lives here 
the world sc what dan has been trying to figure out for the course of his whole career and 
we have a wonderful discussion back and forth where we both ask each other questions because thought very very 
about the nature of existence the world we live in the nature of thought how we conceptualize going on 
questions that are very important to me like emergence and intentionality how okay to talk about things like purposes 
choices in a world that is ultimately governed by the laws of physics so i already said previously and 
think maybe only to patreon subscribers but this is probably my favorite podcast interview that ever done and i 
that gonna enjoy it just as much remember we have a web page preposterousuniversecompodcast where you can find show 
transcripts of every episode and you can also find a link to support mindscape if you like on patreon 
patreon supporters get benefits like monthly ask me anything episodes and episodes that are completely ad free so this 
gonna be very very fun episode i hope you enjoyed it as much as i did go music sc 
dennett welcome to the mindscape podcast daniel dennett glad to be with you sc you had a little thing 
you said when i was in the room one time that sure said many many times but it really 
a cord with me talking about wilfrid sellars and the manifest image and the scientific image and how you 
of your task as a philosopher to reconcile these why you tell us why we begin setting the stage 
telling us what these are dd oh good glad you asked wilfrid sellars great american philosopher said the job 
philosophy was to explain how things in the broadest sense of the term hang together in the broadest sense 
the term well that sounds sort of trivial chuckle things hang well but what he had in mind is 
all the things of the everyday world colors and sounds and haircuts and pains and dollars and home runs 
all things then in the scientific world electrons and quarks and fields and molecules and how do we relate 
things of our every day sort of prescientific world to the things that science has discovered and what one 
years and more have shown is no simple answer sc wait sorry when did sellars say this dd in 
thousand nine hundred sixtyone or two but i mean when i say one hundred years i mean say since 
when the world really starts to look weird from a scientific point of view and you have people saying 
just atoms in the void and no such thing as solidity and no such things as colors and after 
atoms colored and the made of atoms just atoms and empty and then we can go on from there 
at one extreme you have people who have insisted that the scientific image the gold standard what real sc 
yeah dd reality everything else is illusion but as a cartoon i like puts it reality the world we 
in maybe an illusion but the only place you can get a good cup of coffee chuckle so not 
helpful to be told that not only do dollars and homeruns not exist but colors exist and pain exist 
yeah dd and solidity exist so we have to negotiate between the two worlds summer says what philosophy is 
and yeah i agree about as good a definition of philosophy as i can think of sc but adding 
little bit right one could buy into formulation while still denying that the manifest image is capturing something real 
dd oh yeah i mean image leaves all the options open sc yeah dd it leaves open both the 
scientific realist who says everything else is just illusion eliminativism as philosophers say or you could go the other 
and say the electrons and quarks and all that just a useful fiction really real is tables and chairs 
people and ideas and love and so forth and so those are the two extremes and then all kinds 
positions in the middle and my view which might seem to be giving up especially to philosophers is to 
we have to learn how to get back and forth between these two images the manifest image and the 
image but the way we do that is not by strict definitions that are counter example proof the way 
do it is with diplomatic and pedagogical ways of easing the passage like an old example voices are voices 
sc okay dd a voice it made of is it a bodily part is it biological material but you 
record a voice you can recognize a voice sc it has causal power in the world right dd it 
voices if you say what category of things they are you run out it seems to be almost in 
category by itself well alright fine we need a voicethroat problem to go with a mindbody problem sc right 
could yeah dd we may not know how to answer the question of what voices are but not mystified 
puzzled not baffled just a curious fact about the way language and our perception of the world prescientific perception 
the world carves things up and the otolaryngologists and the other biologists and the acoustic engineers can tell us 
about voices we ever have to settle that issue sc right i label this view in my book the 
picture poetic naturalism the motto being that only one world the natural world but there are many ways of 
about it and those ways all can capture some elements of reality and silly to call them illusions just 
not the most fundamental thing dd i think good and yeah i think gee i read your book yet 
sc yeah dd you know i think about right sc no the idea was not supposed to be anything 
just a label to help people understand there are people who want or who are eliminativists right who wanna 
that some of these higher level structures count as real dd yeah and been battling against that view for 
sc so sure get there but just to label to put things on the table so before we get 
so therefore you will think of things such as consciousness and free will as real dd yeah sc for 
this kind of reason dd real but not what you think they are sc not what we think they 
right okay dd my motto x is real but not what you think it is sc good so you 
a paper a while ago called real patterns dd yeah sc and i wanna talk about that a little 
i know if you even are aware that this has become an important fun topic in quantum mechanics dd 
i know that no sc yeah david wallace who is one of the leading theorists of the everett or 
worlds interpretation which also a partisan of leans on your paper and your notion of real patterns very heavily 
his book the emergent multiverse dd oh great sc trying to explain how the classical world forget about tables 
chairs but even electrons with positions and atoms and things like that are somehow not there in the most 
formulation of quantum mechanics but they describe the pattern and therefore real dd yeah wonderful delighted yeah sc can 
give the sales pitch for what your view is there in that real patterns paper what trying to get 
dd the main idea of the paper is that if we think about information we think about information theory 
recognize well to put it in sort of everyday terms big a file do you need to capture this 
sc yeah dd and if you have a checker board which has got just sixtyfour squares and some are 
and some are white pretty easy you can give a very limited description of that pattern and write it 
the back of an envelope if you got a color picture of confetti and you have to describe it 
detail got a much bigger file why some pictures on your phone are bigger have used more megabytes than 
pictures it all depends on how much complexity there is in the picture and if no pattern in the 
at all if just random oddly enough the one that takes the most information to record because you have 
every pixel you say a region of deepblue over here and a region of red over those are nice 
ways of taking advantage of the pattern in the phenomenon so the idea of real patterns is take any 
and are there patterns in it well a pattern a pattern is a summary of concision something that permits 
to generalize so that better than a coin flip about what the next little bit of it is if 
any predictive edge at all on the data set that looking at you got a pattern sc right and 
well let me put this way we should be happily surprised when there are such patterns in some sense 
the patterns enable you to do is to ignore certain pieces of information like you said dd absolutely evolution 
selection has designed organisms to be ruthless pattern finders to ignore almost all the information officially available at their 
and just focusing on what matters to them those are the patterns that if they can latch onto those 
can feed themselves and avoid getting eaten and live long happy lives and mate and all the rest so 
idea of a pattern is i think a very useful and deep idea and it can be given a 
clear mathematical formulation and the key what science does is finds pattern but also what the manifest image does 
take for granted all the patterns that we see in fact we do more than that we over interpret 
that is if we see two things that look the same shade of green to us we think deepdeep 
they are the no they might be green for entirely different reasons they might be so called metamers and 
only look the same color to us because where you might say greengreen color blind chuckle sc yeah i 
a podcast with melanie mitchell who is a computer scientist dd oh yeah i know her well sc about 
struggle of artificial intelligence to capture common sense and would it be offbase to think that some of this 
has to do with the fact that even very advanced deep learning networks and so forth are not as 
at finding the patterns as a human intelligence is at the current state of the art dd good see 
think true except for the fact that if you crank your deep learning system long enough find patterns where 
any patterns chuckle i mean deep learning systems algorithms are very good at squeezing pattern out of apparently random 
how the neuroscientists they train up categorize on this fmri data about going on in heads and they discover 
can make a prediction about what gonna do ten seconds later yeah they can and that shows that a 
pattern but a lot of the patterns they find by these methods real that is they predict the thing 
well the thing wondering if because what the ai is what the deep learning networks are so good at 
manipulating huge amounts of data that they need to be as tricky as human beings are define the patterns 
let you know predictions with fewer dd right so of course we pay a price for that not a 
and the price we pay for that is that we have a lot of false positives we see a 
more pattern in the world than it is really there we see similarities that are only similar in that 
have the same effect on us but they are otherwise as different as can be sc well what does 
word real in the phrase have the same meaning as the word real when we were just talking about 
being real dd well that was the idea i wanted to say if we have the concept of a 
we do have some pretty good test as to whether real that is to put it bluntly can you 
money betting on it if you can predictive real and a touchstone of reality that seems to hold up 
well so say maybe patterns are the thing most obviously where we can make a realnon real distinction and 
everything every other distinction between real and unreal and real and fictional real and bogus somehow dependent on that 
so if a room and this huge number of atoms in the room and of course if you were 
smart and i gave you the location of all the atoms and their velocities you could predict anything you 
be demon but the patterns the other structures are the idea that i could give you much less information 
that i could say a baseball and headed toward a window and then you could infer an enormous amount 
that dd exactly exactly sc and therefore baseballs are real in some sense dd right years ago i concocted 
example to show the power of this where we have a visiting martian a sort of laplacian demon and 
house and the phone rings and the lady picks up the phone and says dear bringing the boss home 
dinner do get a bottle of wine on your way home see you in half an hangs up okay 
now both the woman and the martian predicts that within thirty minutes two people are gonna walk in the 
one of them holding a glass bottle filled with an alcoholic beverage but the laplacian demon has had to 
out the whole trajectory the stop signs and the lights and the paying of the wine sc every photon 
dd every photon and to the laplacian this is a miraculous prediction where did she how did she do 
without all that information well very simple she understood what was being said yeah sc so take this point 
view that patterns at the higher level that captures some influence some predictability of the world and apply it 
the difficult cases where we have things like people and agents and another phrase that you popularized way back 
the day is the intentional stance so one of the sets of controversial concepts which we might ask are 
real or do they have some special status are things like intentions reasons why aboutness why is a certain 
about something like that so how do those boundarycontentious words fit into this picture dd oh they fit in 
and the intentional stance patterns are just one particular set of patterns and the set of patterns that have 
do with living agents and non living agents that living agents have made i think any other nonliving agents 
the simplest one well when i first started writing about the intentional stance i chose a thermostat then you 
consider the thermostat as a little agent that can be instructed to keep the temperature a certain way it 
the temperature and when the temperature falls below or below the set it has a desire to raise the 
treat a thermostat as an agent surrogate you could have a person standing chuckle there and throwing logs on 
fire but you can replace it with this dead simple thing and you can explain it to a child 
going into the mechanics and there are one hundred different ways you can make a thermostat sc in other 
you can explain it in terms of purpose dd of its purpose in sc rather than its atoms dd 
you say considered a little homunculus a little agent and it has one desire only and that is to 
the temperature but it has a way of sensing the temperature and responding to changes by making an appropriate 
sc by the way this is the way that one gets taught about transistors in physics class dd oh 
sc as if a little man in there transistor man who decides how much current to let through dd 
it turns out that this tactic this strategy of adopting the intentional stance works throughout biology it works not 
for brains and for higher organisms it works for bacteria it works for archaea it works for single celled 
the question is does it work for things as it were smaller and simpler than that well i like 
say robots made of robots made of robots made of robots made of robots and once you get down 
subcellular you get down to the canasins the motor proteins and tubulin and things like that and or chuckle 
of ribosomes fantastic little machines you can treat them from the intentional stance sc they have a job to 
dd they have a job to do they know how to do it and one of the things that 
particularly like about motor proteins is that it now turns out basically sailing using the storm of the water 
inside the sail and they have sort of ratchets in their feet so actually selectively using the energy in 
random bombardment of the water molecules as a source of power and it reminds me of ricky skaggs great 
control the wind but i can trim the chuckle and your basic agent and just a protein sc right 
a little maximal demon this is dd it is it is sc in the last just fifteen or twenty 
this has become another hot topic in physics understanding these non equilibrium fluctuations dd yeah yeah sc and very 
tiny things and i think that probably still under appreciated in my personal world how much this transition from 
world of individual particles where it would make no sense to adopt the intentional stance to the macroscopic world 
driven by entropy and the arrow of time i think interesting dd yeah i think not a sure of 
but i think the key element to being an agent is having a a history that makes a difference 
is something can happen to it that changes it and that change is that again it has a sort 
memory sc yeah i think dd and interesting thing about electrons they pick up scars or dirt or anything 
an electron over billion years change at all and a huge difference we had a wonderful argument in santa 
at the santa fe institute with david wolpert and his colleagues and one of our big issues was whether 
count as agents sc trying to predict which side are you on not like i do it dd i 
against it sc yeah okay dd because i think that the tornado could actually explain information you know the 
a sc a complex system but ascribing agency or intention to it seem to help as much dd so 
but it was a very illuminating discussion so either if you want to look at the boundaries you wanna 
at things like tornados or motor proteins but in the in the living world everything bigger than a motor 
is a designed thing and it has purposes got parts that have jobs to do sc yeah i think 
in the arrow of time is probably a necessary precondition for being an agent in this sense dd yeah 
sc the thing about electron is like you said they have scars they change over time really but more 
things have different access to the past versus the future they have memories of the past and they can 
little bit all they can do is predict the future and when it becomes when purposes and things like 
might become necessary so i presume what gonna say then is ascribing intentionality or purposes to things has a 
why we a reason why we do that a reason we have reasons it makes sense for ribosomes so 
makes sense in exactly the same way for human beings not in a different way dd yeah absolutely and 
think interesting to think about the history of this before there was language you have any agents that were 
notes that were arguing that were explaining language brought into the world onto our earth something that wilfrid sellars 
the space of and this the space of reasons is where human persuasion and explanation and querying and challenging 
the whys and the becauses and the arrival the emergence of the space of reasons that has to have 
evolutionary history too and this only in one species so why interested so much in the evolution of language 
in evolution of human minds which are profoundly different from even chimpanzee minds or dolphin minds or whale minds 
your favorite birds take your favorite species human minds are really different and different precisely because they are obliged 
articulate reasons sc okay dd and they learn how to do this and an imperfect business and some are 
than others but the fundamental basis for morality if you are responsible because you respond to reason you argue 
bear out of what doing but you a human being is supposed to be persuadable sc so you can 
or teach a dolphin or a dog or whatever but you give it a reason why just pure stimulus 
response right dd and recently in my work had lots of examples of what i call freefloating rationales this 
where we see a phenomenon the reasons are clear but not the reasons of the organisms involved so the 
or pronking gazelles are throwing these great extravagant leaps and running away from the lions say are they and 
tremendous waste of energy and it makes it dangerous what doing is showing off they are signaling to the 
bother try to catch me i can throw these big expensive dangerous leaps and still outrun you go after 
cousin over there he do and the lions believe them and the evidence for this is pretty clear sc 
was gonna ask there is a sc this is a testable and tested hypotheses and sure enough the lions 
and they go for the ones that are stunting now given you the rational explanation the lions are in 
wise to take this information being offered to them it benefits both the speedy gazelle and the lion have 
work as hard to get his supper and lots and lots of cases of this but think that the 
understands this or that the gazelle understands this this is a rationale that has been uncovered by natural selection 
gazelle just know why it wants to make those leaps it does if it can the lion know why 
care for those jumpy ones they have to know so they are the beneficiaries of a rational system that 
have to understand it sc and more or less exactly the same sense in which alphago know why it 
a certain token on the go board in some way dd right right sc it knows what to do 
yeah sc it tell you why dd and so do the ribosomes in every one of your cells a 
for every part of the job meaning if you look at the machinery elegant elegant engineering but the ribosome 
and in fact no agent figured that out in advance the nobelwinning molecular biologists the chemists they worked it 
for the first time what the rationale is but the rationale is secure as anything sc and in some 
among philosophers here the fact that we human beings can attach reasons to this in this sense has to 
with some sort of counterfactual thought experiment if the gazelles were not leaping in that way then we know 
the lions would chase them even if the gazelles know that dd right no the intentional like an instinct 
think and i think probably though a baldwin effect i think first it came on the scene in its 
form with human beings discovering they could talk about the reasons why things were happening but very very good 
it and in fact if you wanna see it as an instinct you can go back and see the 
animations of simple triangles and circles moving around on the screen but everybody looks at it and says the 
circle is trying to catch the little everybody instantly sees intentionality and purpose in these cases infants quite young 
are puzzled by violations of the apparent agency in very very simple displays sc but in circles and triangles 
an edge case here because saying that the ascribing of intentions to human beings or to the behavior of 
gazelles is real and true whereas presumably not real and true in the case of the circles and triangles 
well hang on see whose experiments am i thinking of i think of his name right now a german 
when he made the films to show to people he deliberately set out to create these intentional patterns sc 
see okay there was an intention working behind the scenes dd he wanted to show that just and in 
he tested this by having sort of randomly moving circles and triangles and people did not attribute intentionality to 
that was just noise so there and chuckle in the same way natural selection has enforced the patterns that 
see in the jumping gazelles and the lions not just random so we can see intention where none very 
at that called paranoia sc thomas pynchon has some novels about this yes dd yes yes sc and you 
see it emerging i guess you use the word emergence that much but are you happy with the word 
emergence is a word that i use much because it has a sordid history in philosophy where emergence comes 
mean woo woo inexplicable and sc physicists use it all the time but warned by my philosophy colleagues i 
in fact when john holland wrote his book emergence i said john gotta put a foreword in where you 
what you and i completely approve of john work on emergence because it does not mean that this is 
inexplicable pattern precisely not in fact i like to illustrate emergence with john horton life world and the amazing 
that emerge there and say look emergence and completely explainable and predictable moves no question mark anywhere in that 
but it creates stunning emergent effects sc yeah and you can talk this higherlevel vocabulary and capture some of 
dd absolutely it it what emergence gets you sc yeah so with that definition of emergence on the table 
seems to make sense that patterns are real if gonna ascribe reality to these higherlevel things that give us 
way of capturing going on purposes and intentions are in that bucket like they serve a purpose like saying 
is the reason why that helped us understand going on dd absolutely sc so now we get to consciousness 
chuckle dd yes yes sc maybe just let you fit it in dd and it emerges in this innocent 
and the idea that one thing that everything in the universe is either conscious or not that the light 
on or the light is off that is i think a fundamental error but very widespread just amazing how 
really deep and clever thinkers get out of their heads that consciousness is all or nothing and i think 
no emergent and in fact what that means is that the search for the simplest form of consciousness a 
hunt a wild goose chase because it emerges and yes starfish have some of the aspects of consciousness so 
trees and bacteria and as sc but not electrons dd but not electrons and we can argue about motor 
chuckle i guess sc but once you admit that nothing mystical something that builds up then you can write 
dd and the question where do you draw the line is an ill motivated question like where do you 
the line between night and day sc do you have a simple definition of what consciousness is that you 
dd no chuckle chuckle sc you did write a book called consciousness explained so this might be an okay 
dd i did and but i think that in one regard the way science proceeds too scientists sit around 
hours and hours and hours trying to define time energy they get on with the theory and once got 
really good theory it will be obvious what time or energy is and i think the same as consciousness 
okay but still you must have something in mind yeah dd yeah i think talk about human consciousness sc 
course dd human consciousness is much more in my view and an inbound one but pretty sure of it 
consciousness is much different from the consciousness of any other species and the reason hard to see this is 
many reasons one is that consciousness has a moral dimension and we wanna be kind to animals and the 
idea so we say yes dogs are conscious but not the way we and people immediately they get their 
up in there about ready to talk about mistreating animals and not no no no because i think the 
of human consciousness that we share with dogs and mammals and birds to some degree with reptiles and fish 
have moral significance so see if we can take moral significance as itself a graded notion if interesting british 
octopus vulgaris protected an honorary vertebrate against the law to throw a live octopus on a hot grill sc 
when did this become against the law in the uk dd some time in the last twentythree years sc 
i had not heard of this interesting sc that one not all cephalopods it probably should be squid you 
throw a squid on a live grill you can sc but the point it that you are allowed to 
a lobster but dd you are allowed yeah sc you do it for the hot grills dd the british 
says vertebrates a cut off sc right okay dd and so you can sc i think cutoffs are okay 
general for these tricky questions people say if you draw a line here then they argue about either but 
gotta draw it somewhere especially for legal purposes dd well sometimes well the law has to draw a line 
yeah exactly dd and what we should recognize is the law draws lines that are reasonable to the vast 
of people and we can talk about exceptions and this is an interesting case the wonderfulness of octopus the 
of convergent evolution between octopus and say human beings is enough to sort of push them over the line 
i think i approve i say but if we put the moral issue behind us know and before we 
the moral issue behind us we should know that almost nobody wants to hold any nonhuman species responsible morally 
for their behavior key they may be as one says moral patients but not moral agents a bear that 
a tourist has not committed murder just not because they have the mental wherewithal they have the kind of 
will that we have sc we have offered them a reason not to do that dd right we expect 
to appreciate the societal norms that set up and so forth so look in the brain and a human 
for the fact that one of them is indeterministic and the other one is deterministic determinism has nothing to 
with the issue it has to do with information it has to do with self control and with degrees 
freedom and degrees of freedom is a term that been using more and more recently and really seeing it 
more out of engineering than out of physics and thinking a degree of freedom is an opportunity for control 
you can clamp a degree of freedom and then you have to control it you can just lock it 
in one way or another sc yeah dd how many degrees of freedom do we have millions billions if 
can think about so many things we have orders of magnitude more degrees of freedom than a bear does 
means the problem sc with roughly the same number of cells and so forth right but the complexity is 
higher dd yeah yeah yeah it means that the options that the bear has are a vanishing subset of 
options that we have and learning to control our perusal of those options not a science an art and 
we try to train our kids to grow up so that when we launch them and they are no 
in our control that they will be able to control themselves in ways that will lead them to have 
and productive lives and if they they are gonna get in trouble and we have to have that set 
troubles looming out there for those who control themselves sc well used the word agent a few times and 
use it all the time but we yet described what that word means so clearly a relationship between agency 
consciousness dd yeah sc is there a simple definition of agent if not of consciousness dd well again the 
is that agents come in all sizes and shapes too and a few minutes ago we were talking about 
is agents viruses is agents heavens so not the sense of agent we want something we want a moral 
we wanna talk about a moral agent is not just a locus of self control with purposes and an 
to fend for itself and prolong its existence and improve enhance its circumstances a pretty good definition of an 
something that can fend off the second law of thermodynamics fend off dissolution mountains agents erosion sc yeah dd 
protect themselves or move or anything sc but you can see why tornados are an interesting edge case dd 
and why tornadoes are an edge case but at the most sophisticated as we climb that ladder and i 
a pretty good scale would be how many degrees of freedom are available for control and when it gets 
into the billions as it does for even young children now talking about potential moral agents and a moral 
is simply a human being at the moment we have any other we could but we a human being 
is mature enough and has an identity with how old they are except coincidently mature enough to control the 
of freedom that matter when they matter and to be able to foresee and understand the outcomes of possible 
and act accordingly so that gives us a pretty good i call it a member of the moral agents 
sc good i think that does make sense to me but it deviated us from our task which was 
were explaining the salient features of human consciousness dd right yeah so one of the curious features of the 
the science has proceeded here is that many theories of consciousness only a tenth have a theory and this 
the inbound path or the upward path and we get from the photons striking the retina and the sound 
and up and up through the nervous system up through the various cortical areas and then tada consciousness happens 
end of the theory wait a minute i wanna ask my what i call the hard question and then 
happens what makes whatever you say amounts to consciousness in the brain what makes that consciousness what does it 
what does becoming conscious of this or that enable the agent whose consciousness it is to do or disable 
agent from doing what effects does it have on those multiple degrees of freedom and the answer is almost 
can happen but we need to have the neuroscientific theory of how that can be true and how the 
sequelae the various outcomes can spell themselves out dd some theories of consciousness are a little bit like somebody 
mounts a closedcircuit tv camera on the hood of his car and puts a receiver under the hood so 
the car can see where going i mean no gonna consume that information ruth millikan talks about the consumers 
representations and in scientific theories of consciousness there has been a systematic neglect of the consumers sc sorry the 
are understand that dd the consumers are ultimately moral structures that respond to representations spread all over the brain 
waves that give rise to the ability of people to report and reflect on and remember a tremendous difference 
sensing something and noticing that sensing something and noticing that noticing that sensing something sc the first time i 
was familiar with your work was the collection you had did with douglas hofstadter called and not sure that 
that young age when i came across it i absorbed it very much but the one idea that kept 
through was this recursive selfawareness idea of looking at ourselves and that has something to do with what it 
to be conscious dd recursion and doug is the maestro there his book i am a strange loop is 
a retelling of what he did in his earlier work in gödel escher bach and the amazing thing about 
escher bach is that it was a bestseller and pulitzer prize winner and a lot of people read it 
a lot of people understand it and sc i read the dialogues when i was a kid and it 
me a lot of time to catch up and read the rest of it dd so i am a 
loop is in a way attempt to do what hume did hume wrote a treatise of human nature which 
said fell deadborn from the press then he had to write the inquiry so that people would understand what 
was saying in the treatise and doug had to write i am a strange loop so absolutely right recursion 
capacity for indefinite reflection and reflection on reflection because whenever you can reflect in this way in effect you 
a new object to think about take a frog a frog has a fairly complicated life and faced at 
moment with a number of opportunities and it survives if it makes good decisions at those opportunities those are 
of freedom and it controls them as best it can sc frogs are agents they fend for themselves dd 
but they know they have opportunities no sign that they can think about their opportunities as opportunities the reason 
i think quite obvious fact is hidden from us is what i sometimes call the beatrix potter syndrome whenever 
see a clever animal or animal doing something that is appropriate and reasonable sly we find it almost irresistible 
attribute to the animal that understanding that we have of what doing and the fact is that very often 
the beneficiary of a very good system that it have to understand it and even true of a lot 
human behavior one of my favorite examples is theory of meaning according to paul grice the late great paul 
when you and i converse when an utterer i might give you a speech act when i utter a 
act i intend you to form a belief based on my speech act but i also intend you to 
that i have that intention so we get thirdorder i intend you to believe that i sc the intentionality 
both sides is key dd got reflexivity and theory there was something clearly wonderful about this theory but as 
theory of human everyday psychology kids have deep and wonderful conversations with their parents and their peers long before 
have the capacity to reflect in this way what you have to understand is that grice lying he was 
the freefloating rationales of human communication he was doing the same thing that the ethologists are doing when they 
out what the stotting is all about finding the rationales this is why communication has the forms it does 
is why it works and these are the conditions and various individuals can be more or less virtuosic in 
sensitivity to this you want to be constantly thinking about recognizing the intentions of this person speaking to if 
did you pay attention to what they were saying sc this idea of the frog not worrying too much 
its decisionmaking is fascinating i did a podcast with malcolm maciver who is a neuroscientist and mechanical engineer at 
and he is trying to explore the idea that one of the major transitions that led to consciousness was 
fish climbed up on land the idea being that a fish swimming around at a few meters per second 
underwater and can only see a few meters in front of it all of its evolutionary pressures are to 
decisions very rapidly once you climb up on land and you can see for kilometers a new space of 
that opens up namely imagine different possible things to do and contemplate which one would be best and so 
says that climbing up onto land enabled the evolution of imagination which was a crucial step along the road 
consciousness dd oh nice not sure i believe it but a nice variation on a theme that very fond 
and andrew idea about the cambrian explosion and parker hypothesizes that the shallow ocean became transparent in a way 
been before and this suddenly permitted distal perception permitted eyesight and the book is called in the blink of 
eye and he argues that the arms race of predator and prey locomotion camouflage armor this all was generated 
a growing transparency and not the only theory out there but one that i think gotta be an element 
truth in it and been arguing that what facing right now is the second great transparency and the electronic 
and now worried and so they should be about privacy and we can now see farther and we can 
into things we could never see into before but we can also be watched and we can be seen 
yeah our sensory for better or for worse sc and so now to invert the image all now living 
a fish bowl laughter sc okay but wait a minute i you used a phrase that you did not 
the phrase hard but you use the phrase dd question sc question good at least a family resemblance between 
distinction drawing between the bottomup theories of consciousness and topdown and distinction between the easy problem and the hard 
dd yeah and not coincidental so i asked the hard question before david raised the hard problem which i 
been throwing pails of cold water on for decades now and i think that the hard problem chalmers problem 
precisely the fix you get yourself into if you stop and try to answer the hard question if you 
the hard question what then left with this gobsmacking jawdropping minddeadening mystery sc for the audience just very briefly 
them what the hard question is that you have and the hard problem that chalmers likes to emphasize dd 
introduces the hard problem by contrasting it with the easy problems the easy problems is how does your brain 
things how does it move your tongue in language how does it do all the cognition that you engage 
how does it recognize things and have memory and all the rest those are the easy problems so the 
problem sc he by the way recognizes not actually easy as we are talking dd yes he does but 
hard problem is the problem of why is it like anything at all to be me and red my 
of red or pain and these are so called qualia and a term comes from the latin it just 
quality properly really but qualia are a term of art in philosophy and i think a bad one an 
of bad theorizing which has led to hundreds of careers of misguided thinking about mind and consciousness and alas 
lot of scientists have been seduced by it so that they think that philosophers have this idea of qualia 
qualia where the going really gets tough explaining qualia those subjective properties the hard problem how do we explain 
and chalmers has been arguing for this for decades and recently written a paper on the metaproblem and the 
is do we have a hard and to which part of my response is do you mean dogs have 
hard problem that mean not conscious it means not reflexively ruminatively theoretically conscious of their consciousness only for us 
hard problem arises as an artifact of the fact that reflective and in our reflections we focus on what 
otherwise a stunning embarrassment when we look inside to see going on mainly we tell sc you mean by 
well think about seeing for a moment sc yeah dd i look out the window and i see a 
on a stake between two trees how do i know i see it well if i close my eyes 
see it anymore alright so i now know light has to bounce off and the photons have to come 
my eye and blah blah blah retina ganglion cells lateral geniculate nucleus over but nothing to which i have 
access something i had to learn from books third person knowledge of the process my first person knowledge is 
limited i tell you a birdhouse out there do you can see do you my eyes are open and 
it well how do you know that seeing a it looks like i laughter sc how do you know 
looks like a birdhouse going on know it just looks like a i can describe it in more detail 
you now nobody is freaked out apparently by the fact that neuroscientists can come in and figure out all 
amazing details about what happens between the eyeball and the lips say but mainly between the eyeball and your 
well notice that only half the story the other half of the story is and what happens between the 
and your ability to talk about it and answer all these questions well just as much neuroscience it has 
go into that is it has to in the first part now if you stop with experience then you 
like declaring victory halfway through the battle no you got the whole rest of you have a theory of 
until explained what happens next i like to point out that if you have a theory of consciousness that 
has a witness in it only got half a theory sc so you wanna turn experience into something going 
in the brain and the neurons and that would be a necessary part of your theory dd and all 
reactions to the experience sc yeah dd a good theory of consciousness when we finally have one it will 
like mill walk it will be like a deserted factory nobody home no agents all just machinery a theory 
consciousness simply has to have that form and people who resist that like chalmers got a hard problem in 
got a systematically impossible problem and i at least can say show you how to get out of the 
namely by asking and then answering the hard question and then what happens and my way of doing that 
hit on this with the philosopher keith frankish have you ever piloted a drone a little so had the 
unit in your hands and making the drone go where going looking at the little screen and using the 
and all that all right think of that that remote controller for the drone the cartesian theater outside a 
room for the drone dd so now suppose we were to emancipate a drone in other words all the 
decisions that you doing while piloting the drone going to upload those put them onboard the drone already got 
lot of selfcontrol already on board but we wanna get every last bit of decisionmaking and discrimination and noticing 
so forth and control we wanna move it all into the drone to do that be asking and answering 
hard question notice by the way the first thing you do once you start doing that is you gotta 
away the screen sc who needs the screen right dd you need the screen already got all the spatial 
in just the form you want it if uploading namely got it into bit strings that can be computed 
just the medium you need now that may not be the medium but at least got it into the 
that gonna have to get it into for controlling the drone in various ways and in our thought experiment 
extended thought experiment unpublished just working on it we gradually see we point out the importance of instead of 
rewiring it when it comes back from each mission or reprogramming it we wanna be able to inform it 
things to it talk with it we want it to be in the space of reasons sc give it 
yeah dd and so we want to install language but we wanna install language the oldfashioned good oldfashioned ai 
by designing it and simply putting it in we want it to learn in negotiation with us we want 
to be able to have its own way of making points and as we think about the task of 
a drone create a language that it can use to communicate with us and like it to be as 
to english as we can get it to teach the drone english but we want the drone to learn 
not just be wired up for english at birth this will give us models of answers to all the 
questions sc it might not be the correct answer for our brains ai is an answer dd it might 
be but at exactly and i think the way ai has always been it gives you an existence proof 
may not be the way we do it but a way of doing this job and the idea that 
or beyond human ken we know not beyond human ken because we found a way of doing it so 
hard to even ask the hard questions first of all we have no personal private knowledge about how we 
it suppose i asked you to imagine three cows standing in the field and the one on the left 
brown and the other two are mottled you can do it sc i do it yep dd yeah how 
i know dd you know you heard my request and you were able to act on it sc yeah 
now an interesting thing about just a simple case like that another example i want you to imagine putting 
plastic bucket over your head and climbing hand over hand up a rope sc okay dd okay now i 
chose items that would not be alien to say a chimpanzee in the zoo can the chimpanzee stimulate its 
brain can could we ask it can it ask itself does it have the layer of control over its 
cognitive processes so that as it sat there not otherwise occupied it could manipulate those familiar items of its 
good question i know the answer but i suspect the answer is no and i suspect the answer is 
because you do that wordlessly until you can do it interactively with language without language i think you have 
systems in your cognitive system for selfstimulation for selfprobing that we have we are virtuoso selfprobers of our own 
sc interesting i wanna pause just to say been going on for a little over an hour now very 
to keep going i have a lot to ask about but i wanna impose on you too much dd 
still got some water sc cool alright dd having a great time sc good excellent very interesting that you 
exactly that because i once asked steven pinker what is the role that language plays in consciousness and he 
none whatsoever he said a completely different thing dd yeah yes i know view well and i think steve 
tremendously smart much smarter than some of his critics take him to be but i think wrong about this 
got it okay i know whether all the experts had a point of view or there was contention dd 
no no no no pretty much out on a limb here in claiming as i did in consciousness explained 
human language just let us talk about what conscious of human language allows us to be conscious of things 
we otherwise be conscious of things that bears and dogs and fish and birds are not conscious of the 
we are sc right and i think once you appreciate or if you appreciate if you believe that recursion 
selfrepresentation things like that are crucial then obviously language is a hugely useful tool dd indeed i think that 
here this is a strange inversion of say view chomsky has the i think bizarre view that recursion is 
shazam gift of natural selection this giant leap that once you have recursion then everything else falls into place 
it is the basis for language and a sense in which i think almost right but i think the 
way around i think language that make any heavy use of recursion in its controls gradually creates in us 
capacity to create recursive levels in our own brains and it goes back to the thing i was giving 
examples of a few minutes ago like i can ask you okay now i want you to imagine a 
triangle and you can do that not perfectly but daniel dor has a book called the instruction of imagination 
is a wonderfully unchomskian look at language and i think got a lot of this right dd what language 
is the development of sort of a place to stand you know archimedes and his me a place to 
and move the world with a language gives us places to stand in our own cognition which permit us 
to selfstimulate to probe to explore our own brains and what creates recursion and what creates the creatures of 
which i think is like qualia it creates a whole menagerie of properties that are not real properties they 
properties that are the effects well no hard to say this they are subjective in the sense that the 
of the property is what brings it into existence sc i see yeah okay now i think i probably 
with you too much about all these issues but let me for purposes of podcast conversation try to channel 
skeptics they place a huge amount of emphasis on the distinction between an external thirdperson view and the internal 
perspective chalmers goes so far as to imagine the possibility of a pzombie that could act exactly like you 
but have no inner conscious experience it always seems like a bit of a conversation stopper to me that 
that you need to speak the language of firstperson subjective experience even to have this conversation because all different 
yeah this on the one hand i think the idea of a philosophical zombie is just an embarrassment somebody 
philosopher once said to me if i understand you right if i wanna talk about philosophical zombies i should 
put a paper bag over my i said laughter sc well i do think that not possible or not 
i think incoherent dd right i think that a way of i think really showing that this whatever it 
trying to do it do a real job and it creates just a distracting monster that should be ignored 
then look at the job it was trying to do and you had a pretty good version of it 
now when you said it looks as if we we just stay with the thirdperson point of view we 
the firstperson point of view and so agree that really amazing is that you have your point of view 
i have my point of view and we know that and we can spend all day comparing our points 
view and a phenomenon that we wanna explain noticed by the way imagine some martian scientists or utterly alien 
they got a lot of good science though and they come to our planet and suppose that they if 
can imagine this and maybe we but start with the idea that we can imagine they have no idea 
consciousness or quality at all sc martian zombies dd martian zombies martian zombies but not just martian by being 
martian zombie philosophical zombies that are earthlings know all about consciousness because they have to to get by in 
world but these are aliens and they come in they study us are they gonna discover the first person 
of view of course they are how by reading our novels by hearing how we talk to each other 
have filled the world with public third person accessible representations of our own first person subjectivity stream of consciousness 
and this is all available this is data hard data to the martian zombies they can go and hunt 
our libraries or watch our television shows and just overhear conversations and have a very they will soon learn 
they learn the rules of baseball and how do the stock market works also gonna learn that we all 
a first person point of view sc i did try unsuccessfully to convince chalmers that the philosophical zombie argument 
a great argument for physicalism because if you really believe that the zombie would act exactly as the same 
of atoms that had consciousness would you could ask it what it was experiencing and it would say experiencing 
or or whatever but by hypothesis not so lying and therefore you know if experiencing those things either because 
what you would do but yeah he buy that dd i know i tried the same argument on him 
mean i think in the end for david and for say galen strawson another philosopher just so sure that 
intuition about their first person point of view is right that they they even hypothetically or for the sake 
argument they abandon that intuition and you know i appreciate that inability or more of a reluctance than an 
i feel the same way when physicists start asking me to set aside some of my intuitions about space 
time and i say i hear you i hear you but something in me does i know if i 
to abandon that intuition i know what to trust sc yeah well it calls up the reliability of usefulness 
introspection generally i mean introspection is where we get a lot of these ideas of our experiences should we 
generally skeptical of introspection we learn something from it certainly dd we learn something from it but yes we 
be skeptical first of all start small and build up i love to point out to my students and 
all the ways in which their consciousness the way they think it is for instance it seems that our 
vision goes right way out to the edge of our vision it it seems that we have high resolution 
out to the side we i love to point out that a lot of things that are surprising that 
can demonstrate to them who knew that well you did you so forget about the socalled incorrigibility of first 
acquaintance just a mistake that mean that not reliable informants to ourselves and others about many features but forget 
this cartesian idea that on the inside we are the masters of going on sc so saying that even 
we experience the outside world a lot of stitching and jiggerypokery that comes together to give us this image 
have so why the same thing be true about our introspection dd well no i think that yes i 
that we have very clear cases where people miss introspective if you like and that raises the possibility which 
think every theorist is really sort of honor bound to take seriously that their deepest intuitions their most cherished 
about what their first person experience is might be mistaken well now you may go i can see where 
is going here going to the idea that all zombies but that we have these strong intuitions that and 
a sense i think right sc in a sense dd in a sense that is when we have a 
theory of consciousness we look around inside not gonna find any selves in there not gonna find any witnesses 
there so as far as we can tell when we have that theory it will be a theory which 
not distinguish zombies from conscious beings now is that a failing or the way it should be i think 
way it should be so in a sense the distinction between a zombie a philosophical zombie and a conscious 
we can abandon that but then we have plenty of room to distinguish being conscious of this or that 
being unconscious of this or that being not just in a coma but not cognizant of various things that 
going on around them things happening beneath their notice things that are subliminal things that are unconsciously being done 
can have that wealth of cognitive science and psychology which has been building up for more than one hundred 
is available and all untouched by this the one thing you have to give up is this idea that 
know that not a philosophical zombie no just an artifact of bad theorizing sc so just to be super 
to get the lingo right not claiming that consciousness is an illusion real in the same sense that the 
that we talked about are real these concepts of experiences play a useful role in how we explain what 
go through dd well glad you asked that question sc or not so get it right dd because i 
the term illusion sc okay dd and i think a generational thing i think that the younger generation has 
trouble with illusion as a positive term as in the user illusion consciousness is a user illusion in fact 
manifest image is a user illusion way of simplifying the world for us in the same way that software 
have brilliantly created these metaphorical icons and sound effects and think of how badly you would misunderstand the computer 
you tried to figure out how computers work by simply extrapolating from the user illusion sc yeah taking literally 
files on your desktop dd right the user illusion is a brilliantly the user illusion of a laptop or 
smartphone is brilliantly designed to exploit your perceptual and locomotory and hand dexterity powers and your audition to your 
to permit you to perform things you wanna do ignorant of the details of how going on same thing 
true in your brain the one difference is that no screen because no eyeball in there so if you 
know who is the victim of the illusion no the beneficiary of the user illusion sc but now a 
confused we agreed the elements of manifest image are in oftentimes real dd well yeah real illusions sc okay 
illusions this dd well yeah real sc maybe the vocabulary is not up to the task so consciousness is 
real and an illusion dd yeah sc yeah dd yeah sc a trick trick is a better word than 
maybe trick is a better word than illusion dd well yeah for years been saying consciousness is a bag 
tricks a whole lot of different tricks not one big pre lengthening metaphysical trick a whole lot of engineering 
and those engineering tricks create an agent that has a instant reliable dexterous fluent use of a huge array 
representations the agent one need to know how those representations are created or in this case even where they 
or whether they have the properties they seem to have a way of thinking about it think of stage 
and often i like to use examples from stage magic a sort of honor code among magicians supposed to 
something show not tell chuckle you done a trick if simply bribed the audience or we can test our 
here what would you think of a magician that used mass hypnosis and simply could hypnotize the whole audience 
then have flaming elephants dancing on their toes and no display at all nothing on the stage the magician 
all alone but everybody is just going and say well a sort of a cheat sc yeah yeah dd 
really count well why not so instead of hypnosis do it scientifically hypnosis is apparently a real phenomenon but 
that you got a magician who says now ask people to wear a special headset to my magic shows 
this is a headset which simply keep it dead simple just beams directly to occipital cortex the first major 
station for all visual information and it can simply create hallucinations there this is him bypassing the eyeballs photons 
no longer part but everything else say it could be from the optic nerve maybe what doing is he 
simply captured the optic nerve with his device everything from the optic nerve in is as it would be 
there was a flaming elephant standing on his trunk would that be magic but at least we now have 
that were darn tooting sure that they had seen an elephant standing on its trunk on the stage question 
they have qualia no thrown away the screen no more room they think they have qualia sc they think 
the elephant but they seen the elephant they think had the experience of seeing the elephant dd right well 
have had the experience of seeing an elephant a bogus experience because there was no elephant out there but 
we take the whole phenomenon from the light hitting on the stage up through the eyes and through to 
to the conviction center to what people will swear on a bible they saw at every point we could 
principle intervene and lay out the food for the consumers at the next level and it might be very 
late and if it was very very late you might get some very anomalous things like is weird for 
moment there i could have sworn that there was an elephant on this stage it just sort of hit 
but no details or we do have experiences like that sc sure oh yeah so a sense in which 
is real also a sense in which an illusion dd yeah yeah and in particular the solution sc okay 
dd the solution is what the theorists may have and the dog the dog think it has qualia the 
does just false an artifact of bad theory sc so would we take the same angle on free will 
an aspect of it real aspect which is an illusion dd yes and no of course sc a favorite 
to everything dd yes yes the traditional idea of free will where somehow our bodies or our brains are 
from causation crap just gotta be false sc not laws unto ourselves dd not laws no miracles happening like 
so if what you think free will has to be if you think free will is incompatible with say 
then no free will then free will real an illusion but i would prefer to say free will is 
real it just what you think it is sc yeah which you did predict ahead of time that you 
going to say so good but it so the sense in which real has something to do with the 
that it plays this explanatory role and you manifested it dd not just an explanatory role it plays a 
role in lives as i was saying before since our society has the concept of free will when i 
the mortgage papers for this house i was asked if i was signing this of my own free will 
said yes yes i am yes sc did the agent have any idea who he was talking to or 
she was talking to dd well the notary was reading this off a piece of paper and i was 
too happy to answer but some people have free will some people are incapacitated some people in control so 
very real difference and it makes a huge difference in life i like to put it this way consider 
to our drone suppose we throw away the controller and just let it be its own selfcontrolled autonomous thing 
dangerous yeah well you think dangerous think how dangerous we are sc empirically pretty darn dangerous yes dd empirically 
have millions of degrees of freedom and not in control but our own or we can try to control 
parents i like the idea that parents eventually have to launch their children and once launched them no longer 
missiles now autonomous and how do we dare let people do this we dare let people do this because 
trust that people will have done their best to turn their offspring into self controlled responsible agents sc yeah 
and what free will is and no metaphysical bright line but there are lots of legal bright lines and 
and invasive and this sort of arms race going on where as we discover one loophole or another we 
exempt or not various people from responsibility or diminish their responsibility sc well the legal responsible moral questions that 
this very vivid dd absolutely sc and i know that you said things i wanna take this opportunity to 
as much as we can sort of hinted at the idea that even though we sophisticated scientists and philosophers 
that there are laws of physics and we all obey them we should let the people have their free 
in some sense because it makes them act more morally that may or may not be true for me 
that fact has nothing to do with why i think that sensible to talk about free will my reason 
talking about free will is just the answer you just gave which is that it does play this role 
helping to explain what goes on dd yeah well i i think that the idea that we have free 
is a sort of holy myth that we should preserve for the good of hoi polloi no no no 
all need it i think extremely paternalistic patronizing to say i need the illusion of free will but everyday 
they need no i think first of all i think just obnoxious sc right dd we all go through 
gauging our opportunities making choices taking them as seriously as we do which is sometimes not seriously enough and 
in trying to persuade others dd and sometimes too serious in trying to persuade others no secret that this 
of activity including mental activity including hamletlike thinking and mulling and musing and worrying no secret why it exists 
makes civilization possible and i for one would rather live in a civilized world sc but so a very 
distinction i think that has the danger of slipping by there not that we need to tell people they 
free will to make them civilized that we have to appreciate that we have free will so that we 
civilization dd yes absolutely right yes sc got it okay very good dd but then that does mean that 
free will skeptics including some heavy hitting scientists sc some of our best friends yeah dd yeah some of 
best friends really engaging in a sort of an antisocial behavior a sort of cognitive vandalism i try to 
them with that term i have a little thought experiment about that possible if you have an obsessive compulsive 
to have a little device installed in your brain that will help control it and so facts so fat 
now gonna add a little science fiction so this chap has obsessive compulsive disorder and he goes to his 
neurosurgeon and asks for the installation and she installs it and then after he wakes up after the operation 
says free to go oh and by the way in radio control here we monitor you and if you 
are about to commit some terrible act we intervene of laughter dd have a nice life sc i think 
black mirror episode have you watched black mirror dd no no sc i think if you have any inclination 
especially like the first few seasons of black mirror are made for you you should watch all of them 
okay sc all thought experiments about how technology is controlling our brain and getting into our lives dd okay 
i wonder if black mirror has the sequel that i so this fellow goes off and reassured that got 
safety net he becomes a little bit slovenly in his decision making and he makes some bad decisions pretty 
he ends up in court and the judge confronts him and asks him about he says no i have 
free know sc just obeying the laws of physics dd i just obey the laws of physics and the 
you know they their and the judge calls in the neurosurgeon says you tell this man that when you 
this device in that henceforth that he would be a sort of electronically controlled and she said yeah we 
says not true is she says of course not just messing with his now she did something evil well 
she in her white coat her scientist white coat is doing something evil for that guy what about you 
out there in science land who are going around telling everybody that free will is an illusion that they 
all really just puppets why that the same sort of antisocial behavior that this neurosurgeon this imaginary neurosurgeon is 
in sc i like that okay very good i will remember that not how the black mirror episode ended 
still a good one good i think to wrap up deviate a little bit from had a long career 
many greatest hits so i think hit some of them here but what are a world view that sketching 
that is very coherent and fits together in various ways laws of physics darwinian evolution intentional stances real patterns 
are the implications of that as been begun to touch on this but for morality for ethics for how 
should live our lives right is there a meta ethical conclusion that comes from this or even ethical conclusion 
well yes i think there is and part of it is yet another aspect to my work we mentioned 
it means we need religion religion was maybe a good scaffold on which to build civilization maybe the myths 
religion kept people in line and cooperating because they were worried about big brother watching them and maybe quite 
with a hypotheses not provable but they might be true and say that that civilization depended on religion i 
it does anymore i think we can grow up and simply abandon the myths but when we do that 
wanna be sure that we destroy or discard some of the valuable things that came along with that the 
that most concerns me is one that you can get at with the line of robert frost he says 
home is where when you have to go there they have to take you in now in that sense 
lot of people that are homeless and trust the state to take care of them one of the things 
religions have done over the decades over the millennia is taken in and provided a sense of meaning and 
for people who otherwise would not have that dd and those of us who were fortunate enough to live 
lives should recognize that this is a social service to call it that is to under play its significance 
orders of magnitude this is a life healing life protecting life improving feature of the world that we want 
throw away the question is how do you save it without also saving the sort of brute irrationality or 
the valorization of unreason and superstition i think possible to domesticate religions a little further been domesticated a lot 
i think we can go a little farther and keep ceremony keep community keep music and art and celebration 
and leave out the myths but a tall order but i see progress all around and i do share 
concern that a lot of people have that while the fastest growing group in the world is the nones 
nones those that have no religion at all if they have no community if they have no allegiance if 
have no if nothing that they think of bigger than and more important than they are to guide their 
then in trouble it just so i think morality is itself a is a human a social construct and 
not for a realist dd yeah and again really just what you think it is not given by god 
deducible from a set of axioms a in a certain sense political and racial creation of ideally an informed 
of people so we sc something that we exercise our free will to create dd yeah we can imagine 
a sort of grounding myth been philosophers like to do this sort of thing you all come everybody come 
welcome you gotta obey some rules some rules of discourse and whatever your current beliefs are about right and 
share them with us if something that your group thinks is really really wrong and the rest of us 
that yet that might be eating meat or it might be well any of the things that religions have 
about just play the faith card and say an xist and xist think this is a no your task 
to convince the rest of us that right sc give us reasons dd give us reasons if you can 
us that a case to be made listen but if you play the faith card if you say is 
reason this is simply who i am i can do no basically what doing when you say that is 
disqualified from this discussion disabled my irrationality prevents me from playing the role available to me and i think 
we imagine morality as whatever emerges from that in the ideal circumstance the kind of human construction it is 
well i think done a terrible job at playing the advocate here i agree with you too much but 
dennett thanks very much for being on the podcast it was very educational and fun dd well thank you 
you asked all the right questions music wonderful just wonderful my impression of dan dennett is that he seldomly 
out is kind of sentences to define the key concept involved in the conversation which makes his opinion hard 
grasp his brilliant counterexamples can make it easier but maybe the real difficulty lies in the topic itself i 
patricia churchland once said in the podcast even understand stereovision how the hell can we get to maybe way 
a valid way not involve axioms yet clears up the view by showing what it is not i really 
every episode of the podcast thanks sean for doing this greatly enjoyed the podcast i would like to argue 
on the idea that free will is an illusion or a societal construct and argue that people can have 
will despite being quite incapacitated in some fashion i think that free will is the experience of brain processes 
to an outcome free will is an inherent part of being conscious and being able to think about thoughts 
to have knowledge of self as an entity which is continuous in time and which has made choices in 
past the outcomes of brain processes that lead to a choice are entirely determined but so is the experience 
seeing and we are usually try to convince people that their experience of seeing green is an illusion the 
of free will can exist regardless of whether a choice is rational i give two examples if a man 
psychotic and punches a person because he believes he is being attacked by a martian the psychotic man still 
his choice to punch as being his free will indeed he is outraged and distressed when he is locked 
in a psychiatric hospital as he believes that others have encroached upon his free will and they just understand 
behaviour is both determined and irrational but his free will is present as it is his experience of his 
processes coming to an outcome regardless of how this occurs if another man becomes enraged when he is treated 
by his boss and thus quits his job his decision may have been affected by anger arising from years 
abuse from his parents when he was a child while his decision is affected by unconscious processes and his 
at his boss is out of proportion his experience remains that of free will the legalmoral questions regarding decisions 
hinge upon free will a judge may give an angry man a short jail sentence for a crime of 
as the man has a childhood history of abuse and he is thus seen as not being entirely culpable 
the judge may give the same man a long jail sentence as the childhood history of abuse makes him 
likely to assault again the judge may order the psychotic man to get psychiatric treatment rather than send him 
jail despite the man experiencing free will at the time of the assault free will is an experience and 
be denied societal issues of responsibility and morality are related but distinct it was very nice to notice that 
new episode has and that guest is daniel dennett wonderful dd human being is supposed to be that statement 
something more than physical laws at work what is at work when we declare that anything is supposed to 
true wonderful discussion loved every bit maybe one reason that sean enjoyed this podcast so much is that he 
dan agree on almost everything dennett is persuasive on all the controversies not only do i find myself consistently 
with his ideas but the arguments and examples and thought experiments he deploys to support them are so carefully 
and honed bravissimo sean this is really accessible for the educated lay person but without muddying or dumbing down 
miniheap daily nous dear sean i just listened to this podcast and i wanna mention some points first dan 
to stick to his old ideas on conaciousness without saying anything new every single argument he mentioned on cinsciousness 
a simple counter argument propoaed by his opposing counterparts he has to answer this simple question that if we 
to plant the subjective experience of pain burning etc what kind of hardware or software we need to put 
a robot other than its necessary hardwares or softwares for reaction or reflex we know that pain is just 
a reaction or reflex but pain is a subjective unpleasant experience until now no philosopher or scientists including dan 
been able to procide an answer for that so i really want you to invite a philosopher who is 
defending the hard problem best ario dennett is an illusionist about phenomenal experience the various qualities that according to 
we mistakenly believe to exist when conscious and having sensory experiences he says that wrong to think experiential qualities 
for instance the feeling of pain or the sweetness of sugar there are only various behaviors internal and external 
reports of sensations see his journal of consciousness paper as the obvious default theory of at httpsasetuftseducogstuddennettpapersillusionismpdf illusionism is 
pretty radical and not surprisingly minority view among philosophers and wondering if sean follows dennett in this since it 
to me from the podcast in any case i argue against illusionism in part three of consciousness why experience 
also in the journal of consciousness studies see dennett says we hold animals morally responsible for their actions but 
true if a dog attacks a human they are routinely put down in other words they are found guilty 
a judge and given the death penalty same goes for wild animals if a bear kills a human or 
if a bear kills livestock or a pet they are also put down because they are deemed to be 
used to humanity and the easy meal options at the edges of human habitation i know if this changes 
point about animal consciousness but we humans definitely hold animals morally responsible for their actions great episode as always 
caveat is how you both claim that animals are incapable of reasoning a better way of putting that point 
have been that other animals species are not capable of many kinds of human reasoning we should not dogmatically 
the possibility that other species have their own unique reasoning processes another assertion i found dogmatic was remark that 
animal thought is stimulus and if you look at zombie arguments for example you see very quickly that there 
no consistent way of exempting humans if we are to take a mechanistic view of the mental life of 
beings for those who are interested in an introduction to animal studies specifically focusing on animal consciousness reasoning and 
i highly recommend the following books marc beckoff foreword by jane goodall emotional lives of jeffrey masson susan mccarthy 
weep the emotional lives of barbara king animals as scientists and philosophers we need to keep an open mind 
the science and make informed assertions especially when it comes to complex phenomena such as the inner lives of 
pingback recap efrens blog i really respect dan and think consciousness explained is a seminal work in philosophy of 
i do however have some issues that other people have raised here i feel he misdirects a lot especially 
discounting others theories a good example was when he was explaining why he thought the hard problem a good 
to look at things he falsely explains the intention of the theory which what chalmers has in mind simply 
is it that a collection of atoms gives rise to phenomenal experience also because a dog ponder the hard 
has nothing to do with the statements legitimacy the hard problem exists for dogs just as much as humans 
he does this a lot i remember specifically but he does the exact same thing with the chinese room 
on philosophy bites maybe a straw man is the right term i quite understand his hard question either for 
moment it sounded great with the drone but then he lost me this could be my inability to understand 
complexity of it however also all this talk on language vs consciousness etc both seem to be overlooking something 
seems so obvious to me maybe ignorant and understand why do either of them have to come first the 
exists which is capable of running the all in all though consciousness explained is an amazing book and even 
it tell you what it is through illusions and experiments he tells you what it and introduces a new 
ps get peter singer on and he will explain very clearly the oversights made why moral significance reliant on 
or reason in openended discussions of what makes humans so special etc i always worry a risk that one 
accidentally stumble on a justification for discrimination against people with disabilities even a justification for eugenics heard that racism 
been shaped by intentional attempts to create standards for what makes someone fully human specifically in order to kick 
people out of those standards being gay or transgender used to be classified as a mental disorder as being 
human the precedent for oppression is sobering not fundamentally wrong of course to ask the question of what makes 
a person and what makes my cat a cat we not ask hard questions simply because so hard also 
eat some animals so of course we want to know more about the justification behind that i just want 
point to the sheer gravitas of at stake for human rights if we ever come up with a definitive 
cutoff that potentially leaves some cases of actuallyhuman on the wrong side i just question whether responsible to implicitly 
that kind of thing up for debate this article offers an important perspective from amy sequenzia a disability rights 
with the lived experience of disability httpsollibeancomintelligenceisanableistconcept the article title is attentiongrabbing and provocative like that book title arguing 
empathy but please consider the content on the subject of free will as a necessary concept for giving people 
stake in taking control of their lives say that the idea that all people are fundamentally equal is a 
concept for giving people a stake in not trying to define some people out of humanity i think the 
consistency with offering people shelter and support without asking questions is exactly that it ask questions goes full speed 
as it were that every human being is a human being to replicate the result and the security of 
support without invoking the idea of a spooky deity who tells people to offer that a good place to 
is probably beginning with the premise that every human being is a human being that all equal and possibly 
be diminished to the level of slightlymorecomplicated cat and working backwards to figure out why we believe that and 
we believe that sunk possible misinterpreting something but put into practice the framework you guys are going for in 
episode seems to effectively base the entire worthiness of each individual person on trying to figure out whether they 
or sufficiently enlightenedthinkingchoosingetc on a casebycase basis and a minutebyminute basis is a person in a coma who might 
wake up enlightenedthinkingchoosing is it possible for me to ever be in a coma like that i know if 
like this rabbit hole what about figuring that all the same species and going to selfishly operate in our 
interests with loyalty to each other as any other species in nature does i think that while me eating 
and not other people does relate to me being able to have a conversation with other people and not 
cows another huge factor is simply that cows are not other people i mean with some people rather take 
i can get talking to cows than talking to them and still not going to eat them maybe it 
still be possible for badfaith actors to try and define people out of rights even with a beingthesamespecies argument 
considering how horrifically common oppression can be but it still seems more stable than considering criteria for being rational 
of to say some kind of statement about the importance of valuing all people as equal could be a 
addition to future discussions like this on the podcast you seem incredibly morallyminded and you seem the type to 
to look for excuses for things like eugenics but i do take you at your word when you say 
want a framework for building morality from the ground up and this is an important consideration that could enrich 
discussions this comment is long enough as it is but also the thought experiment of a hyperintelligent hypercapable alien 
can outperform us in every way if one of those visited earth and saw us as animals we would 
just lie down and give up and let it eat us and make decisions for us because after all 
better than cows to something like that a principle of speciesloyalty would satisfy the intuition that we should always 
for our own interests dignity and lives regardless of who or what is out there outperforming us maybe agreeing 
liu gaoxiang in the second above comment i find this discussion to be very loosy goosey comprehend that the 
carroll i am used to following found it a positive experience but apparently he did content delivery use of 
and most all else were not enlightening to me and often irritating i suggest book the strange order of 
and podcast fortyfour between sean and damasio as an example of content and delivery i respect my comment above 
critical of sean where i have no right to be critical his recommendations in his holiday message about podcast 
very positive and i was disappointed ok for me but it does not give me the right to put 
judgement in the underhanded way i did above my take home from this episode pointed to by biologist and 
jerry coyne is that philosophers become everyday more like theologians the latest excuse for philosophy which is nonempirical empty 
read was that it should inspire science but it much if any so now i learn of the retreat 
it should complement scientists and science journalists in popularizing science i think it should try that either and quite 
as scientists become more engaged like sean carroll they will dilute the odd ducks into insignificance after several millenniums 
is time to let bronze age ideologies go what daniel dennett calls the designed user of computers and phones 
from decades of stepbystep evolution and not from any overarching design brilliant or otherwise yes every step was designed 
not all steps led to what we experience today some steps were designed by brilliant teams and failed miserably 
google wave other steps were designed by misguided loners coding on a whim and evolved over the years to 
over the planet like facebook but none of the contributors along the way had user illusion sketched out on 
whiteboard to design from user illusion is as undesigned as the life forms that use it at denett maintains 
an audience does not have qualia if their visual input is coming from a computergenerated nerve stimulator rather than 
their eyes this seems to me to suggest that he does not understand what qualia are though that seems 
believable and of course willing to be corrrected qualia simply the experience of a particular perceptual quality a particular 
or sensation or sound for example a conscious experience of this red is an experience of this red whether 
comes from a red apple in front of me or directly through brain stimulation a la penfield whether a 
representation of something in the world is irrelevant often hand the feeling that denett is talking past other philosophers 
consciousness while thinking addressing their concerns this kind of statement strengthens that impression pingback dillahunty and dennetts dogma the 
thought prophet pingback user is content in my shuffle totally agree with joe lapsley comment no a privilege to 
able to listen in to such an illuminating conversation it seems to me that whenever people discuss free will 
criminal culpability they assume that the judge and jury do have free will while the accused does not if 
is no free will then the police journalists judge jury and general public all have no choice in the 
they come to and the opinions they express both the crime and the sentence were determined at the beginning 
the universe and of course if there is no free will then i have no choice but to believe 
there is and if i change my mind that really be a choice i will say upfront that i 
myself to be more in the dennett camp than the chalmers camp on the consciousness issue but you make 
argument in this podcast and the podcast with chalmers that i find bizarre you seem to say that based 
the notion of a zombie it would act exactly like us in every way therefore it would answer if 
asked if it was conscious and describe its experiences to us if we asked about them and so on 
the zombie would behave just like us how do we know we are not zombies this is a bizarre 
because it seems to me to imply the notion that you only know you are conscious because you observe 
own behavior you observe the answers that you give to questions about whether you are conscious and you infer 
your behavior and the answers that you observe yourself giving that you are conscious i think we infer that 
are conscious in this way not as if we are walking around without having any idea whether we are 
or not until someone asks us we observe ourselves saying and then infer we are conscious because we heard 
say we answer because we already know we are conscious though consciousness may be very different than we imagine 
to be it would be meaningful to ask a zombie behaves just like us then how do i know 
are not a but it make a lot of sense to me to say a zombie behaves just like 
then how do i know i am not a is there any observation you could make of your own 
that would lead you to conclude guess not it is hard for me to imagine what that would be 
if i observed myself behaving like an automaton i would not conclude i was not conscious rather i would 
suffer from the feeling of being a slave at the mercy of forces i did not understand since there 
no observation of our own behavior that could lead us to conclude we are in fact not conscious i 
it makes sense to say we know we are conscious by observing our behavior though we may infer others 
conscious by observing their behavior the argument also seems to imply that the term refers to some kind of 
essence and gets its meaning from that essence rather than from the empirical world and that we could be 
about really having it consciousness is an english word that is used to describe a real empirical phenomenon that 
are acquainted with the explanation of consciousness is meant to explain that phenomenon it make a lot of sense 
me to ask we be zombies and be mistaken about having if we are mistaken than what does the 
even mean if it is not referring to the phenomenon of being awake aware having experiences that we are 
acquainted with than what does it mean if we are mistaken about having consciousness than the word is as 
as the word and asking about the nature of consciousness or whether we could be mistaken about having consciousness 
as meaningful as asking if we could be mistaken about having we know what gloorp is so it is 
meaningful to talk about it at all if you are going to deny that we have consciousness or wonder 
it is possible we are zombies without consciousness you have to know what the term means at least in 
preliminary way and how could you possibly know that if you are a zombie if we are zombies ie 
conscious then the word consciousness has no meaning at all it is just a nonsense word it refers to 
that or we somehow know about a platonic idea of even though we actually possess consciousness neither of those 
makes any sense to me the notion of a zombie was meant to ask the question there be a 
that behaved just like us and was physically identical to us but did not possess the phenomenon that we 
the english word to the answer might be no the notion of a zombie might be incoherent though it 
not as obvious to me that it is as it is to you and dennett but it make a 
of sense to me to ask if we are zombies even if we decided we are zombies and that 
possess the platonic essence there is still some phenomenon that needs explaining and that we have labeled consciousness up
