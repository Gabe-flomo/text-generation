the graphic novel the dialogues click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everybody and welcome to the mindscape 
your host sean carroll and i remember a time it must have been like twenty years ago by now 
my goodness i was a postdoctoral fellow doing research at the institute for theoretical physics at uc santa barbara 
in fact i was not doing research at the moment i was just wandering through one of the local 
and i saw this kid he have been more than nine or ten years old and he found a 
and his eyes lit up and he got the book he ran over to his mom it was christmas 
season and the kid says to his mom he says mom mom look we gotta get this for dad 
elegant universe love it sc about string and that was the moment when i knew that super string theory 
just string theory for short had entered the popular imagination in large part thanks to brian excellent book elegant 
the nova tv special that followed it which is a weird thing to have a theory of quantum gravity 
a theory of everything which is perhaps what string theory could be to be out there in the public 
right not just told to people and they go sc people out there on the streets have really strong 
about string theory some love it some are very disdainful of it a weird state of being for a 
highly technical theory in theoretical physics for some reason string theory captures the imagination one of my fellow postdocs 
the itp back in those days was clifford johnson who is guest on the mindscape podcast clifford is an 
card carrying string theorist written many papers on various different aspects of string theory even authored a book called 
dbranes are part of the string theory tool box and a highly technical book i do not necessarily encourage 
to buy it unless you are a professional physicist sc i do encourage you to buy more recent book 
simply it is a graphic novel that clifford both wrote the text for and illustrated a novel about people 
about science talking about physics and suggesting the idea that sitting over coffee and talking about science is something 
should all be doing an idea that extremely sympathetic with so mostly today be talking about string theory where 
came from why physicists invented it why so many physicists so many very very smart cookies have become incredibly 
by string theory what is the origin of some of the criticisms of string theory out there and the 
of the field today so go music sc clifford johnson welcome to the mindscape podcast clifford johnson pleasure sc 
a physicist theoretical physicist and a string theorist i know some string theorists as soon as you describe them 
a string theorist they say no no not what i am this other so how do you label yourself 
cj i suppose string theory takes up a lot of my time or at least a lot of the 
i work on have their origins in the string theory context and yes probably one of those who pushes 
against being called a string theorist i think maybe the issue is that we like to be defined by 
questions working on rather than the tools using to answer those questions sc so not technology driven cj exactly 
knowledge driven cj right right yeah sc and but nevertheless there have been strings in your papers you write 
i mean sort of what fraction of the papers actually written say in last ten years have been about 
theory one way or the other cj oh probably in some sense probably of them sc okay alright not 
quibble about that laughter sc so what is string theory and why should we care about it cj probably 
thing you hear lots of different answers from different string theorists i tend to think of string theory as 
our best shot right now at understanding a theory of quantum gravity the old problem of trying to understand 
to put together quantum physics and gravity and one of the things about string theory very tantalizing is that 
seems within the way it does that it also gives you a chance of describing all the other forces 
nature that we know of as well sc and something that distinguishes string theory from other approaches to quantum 
cj yeah there are other approaches to quantum gravity that regardless of what you think of them and how 
they are they really do seem to be mostly just a framework that is to do with the gravity 
the quantum and not much else although you know discoveries may be made sc yeah you can always learn 
but what does quantum mean what does gravity mean why is it a whole thing to get them together 
be easy now veteran mindscape listeners have listened to carlo rovelli talk about these things but that comes from 
very different place than string theory but the motivation is similar cj yeah the motivation is really very much 
do with our understanding of the observed universe which is that you will be pushed into regimes where the 
and the gravitational inevitably have to talk to each other so to take a step back the quantum stuff 
traditionally to do with the rules that seem to apply for the very very small the devices we use 
phones things like that they all use the rules of quantum mechanics to move fundamental particles like the electron 
and you can use it to make cool things and understand how atoms work the structure of matter things 
that and that seems to be all about the very small more or less but then this other regime 
is to do with astrophysics and cosmology and so on and so forth which is to do with where 
dominant physics seems to be about gravity cj and einstein taught us how to understand that sort of physics 
called general relativity and all to do with the curvature of spacetime that you may have heard of and 
the description of quantum stuff seems to be more in terms of fundamental particles interacting with each other in 
ways and so they are very very different pictures but these pictures get driven together when you realize that 
example the universe is expanding the universe is expanding its an observable fact and if you run that backwards 
you go to early epochs of the universe in some sense the gravitational stuff that dominates the shape of 
universe has to be understood in terms of the particle physics type stuff the small stuff because the scales 
which the physics is happening are those same scales those very small scales i talked about so the quantum 
has to talk to the gravitational physics in ways that we are we know yet because we have a 
of quantum gravity that we know works for nature string theory sc sorry just to get as a relatively 
matter as these things go what saying is if you want to understand things like the big bang or 
black holes we need both quantum mechanics and gravity at once and we yet have cj yeah in fact 
was gonna get to black holes another region where when you think of the black hole as a thing 
pops out of for example worrying about gravity you end up with famously this thing called the the black 
horizon which is sort of this oneway membrane this place after which you pass you cannot go back out 
the famous black hole horizon it turns out when you apply quantum physics to that no matter what the 
of the black hole is it turns out quantum physics like to play that game of one way barriers 
it tells you that actually a mechanism by which quantum mechanically that oneway barrier will generate ways of stuff 
back out actually leak the energy and mass from the black hole and make the black hole begin to 
and ultimately in principle the black hole would disappear cj and it leads you into a whole bunch of 
famously due to people like stephen hawking who came up with that shrinking mechanism that tell you that you 
to understand again the quantum and gravity stuff better in order to understand the fate of black holes and 
some sense the fate of our understanding of quantum mechanics itself and so there are all sorts of interesting 
that begin to not go away and become more and more annoying if you have a theory of quantum 
to explain them sc so at some very simple level of principle the world is quantum mechanical the world 
gravity so of course you need quantum gravity but saying also a i keep wanting to say straight forward 
downtoearth but really not because talking about the big bang and black holes but as a concrete matter there 
phenomena in our universe that be understood without understanding quantum gravity cj absolutely there are just to blur it 
little bit there are people do propose that maybe there are some get out clauses and you could have 
in the quantum mechanical world without it being quantum but that in some ways can often end you up 
a place harder to explain than just quantizing the thing sc just gonna end in tears i see anything 
coming out of that laughter sc so fine and probably the motivation people are willing to accept but now 
in the world would we say the right way to address this is to replace particles with little loops 
string if indeed what doing in string theory cj well so the answer is is that no one can 
you a good principled reason why you do that it really was discovered by accident that that is at 
the right thing to do or a right thing to do because we know if the right thing to 
when you think from a particle physics perspective about what a quantum theory of gravity should look like or 
quantum theory of any interaction any interaction between objects the particle perspective is that there is a particle whose 
it is to communicate the effects of that force and so the electromagnetism that force the force that governs 
of chemistry and is responsible for electricity and magnetism things like that that is communicated by the exchange of 
the particle familiar with the particle of light and so every different kinds of force the nuclear forces have 
own exchange particles and you can actually work out what the properties of the exchange force should be for 
if you did have a quantum theory of gravity and called the graviton sc the graviton yes and everyone 
says well have you discovered yet and i say and we never will because too hard to but the 
of quantum mechanics and general relativity convince us that there are something called gravitons cj yeah and so what 
could start doing is you could write down a theory that is interacting gravitons and you can just write 
the properties of the graviton how they should interact on general principles and the theory just resists making sense 
its own for various technical reasons which we need to go into it just stops working pretty soon as 
to calculate anything sensible with it completely for other reasons people were playing around with the idea of what 
you were not looking at fundamental particles interacting quantum mechanically but you were looking at loops of string sc 
were we thinking then now cj sorry sc when were cj this is actually back in the the late 
into the for reasons to do with trying to understand nuclear physics they were thinking about this there are 
mechanisms by which in nuclear interactions you effectively make these things that look like strings called flux tubes and 
they move like real physical objects and can interact and split and join and things like that so people 
it would actually be useful to write down a theory just in principle what would such a theory look 
and so if you work it all out it actually works rather nicely and out popped something very interesting 
actually at the time was a bug in the whole description sc yes a problem cj right which is 
these loops of string tend to want to join their ends and become little closedloops of string sc so 
loops you were thinking of started as line segments cj yeah they were sort of lines so they had 
the fundamental particles called quarks that are very important in nuclear physics would be joined by these things called 
tubes and be description and it was thought to be a candidate for the theory of the strong interactions 
bind these quarks together but there were mechanisms by which these strings just the theory tells you that they 
to be allowed to do that to join those ends and become loops of string that are closed and 
you follow that you find that those loops of string the different vibrations they can do the most basic 
if you sort of squint and realize a string sort small enough that it looks like a particle it 
just like that particle that you would have associated with gravity called a massless boson the graviton sc sorry 
think that to the people who do this for a living kind of a remarkable thing the theory forces 
on them cj yeah sc like you invented the cj yeah sc and it forces you to do something 
wanna do how often is that happening in physics cj exactly so you often get requirements so the theory 
to be consistent and you realize i forgot this thing so i need to add that in or i 
the right number of this bit you know the right ingredients put together in the right and then done 
of the remarkable things and i talk about this very fact quite a bit which is that unusual historically 
i think has few such striking precedence that you write down a theory and it says going to work 
a list of demands for what i need in order to and that list of demands then sends you 
in this completely different direction and one of them was that it has to if you write down these 
of string it has to have the particle that people then realize later on was the graviton which the 
it was a problem is because there was no such particle in the strong interactions that they were trying 
describe sc they want that cj they want that so it looked like a big fail and it was 
the the theory did some other things as well really unprecedented is that it says it actually work very 
if you try and have it in our three spatial plus one time dimensions it actually starts telling you 
actually gonna work really well if i work actually it started out being in twentysix dimensions and then there 
better versions of it that work in which is another obvious bug laughter sc so string theory has a 
strong union representation and they have a lot of demands before they get to work cj exactly right sc 
twentysix dimensional space time and you need to have gravity in it cj yeah sc and weaker minds than 
would have said do something cj exactly and well not only do something else but something else did come 
a better theory for describing the strong interactions called quantum chromodynamics came along and so people were very happy 
not have to deal with this list of demands it turns out that there were some people who thought 
was really interesting notably john schwarz and joël scherk they said maybe this theory is good for something else 
bugs are actually a feature and been using this thing for something and this is a great example of 
that i actually think is really important in not just in physics but generally speaking cj if people are 
on a thing with as much integrity as possible just trying to do an interesting thing and develop an 
it may often turn out that not necessarily good for the thing they thought it was going to be 
but it often can have uses elsewhere and certainly in science we see that a lot in various other 
that many ideas that get recycled in various parts and have their home in places other than where they 
first invented and certainly string theory seems to be an example of that sc yeah definitely motivation for letting 
people pursue their interests and what they think is interesting without an immediate obvious payoff in the quarterly report 
gonna eventually get some place big john schwarz my caltech colleague joel scherk who passed away a few years 
as i recall they said gravity exists string theory seem to predict so what do they do about this 
about making it match on to the real world cj so they then said maybe this whole string theory 
is a theory of gravity the higher dimensional part is a suggestion that there are large observable dimensions in 
we live that the three spatial dimensions plus time and they and others that came after them came up 
mechanisms by which the extra dimensions that the string theory suggests need to be there for the consistency of 
theory turn out to be internal degrees of freedom extra decorations that the physics has so it looks to 
if you write it the right way it looks to us like a three dimensional theory plus some extra 
if you like that some would describe as positions in these higher dimensional spaces and others would say just 
flavors of particle and things like that and indeed you can work out models if a string phenomenologist someone 
builds models of string theory that are attempts at representing our real world our observed world cj there are 
well understood mechanisms by which the higher dimensions of the string theory end sorry they end up making themselves 
for example by being some of the unexplained patterns that we actually do see in the standard model of 
so if you work out the list of particles that discovered they assemble themselves into some very sc the 
and the muon and the tau and all the neutrinos and the quarks cj there are various families of 
that really have any explanation the standard model of particles physics describes it but does not explain where these 
come from one thing that higher dimensions can do is in fact give you reasons why those patterns exist 
yeah so we have to get rid we went from i think we need to mention ten at a 
but we had to get rid of a lot of dimensions and roughly speaking we curled them up into 
little tiny ball basically what we do cj one way of doing it not the only way but the 
people often describe it sc the offtheshelf standard package way of getting rid of the extra dimensions but more 
one way of doing that and therefore there is one string theory get to that too maybe but not 
many flavors of string theory at the most fundamental level but there are many ways that it could manifest 
as three plus one dimensional spacetime cj yeah the mechanism by which those hidden dimensions become hidden the shape 
that space as it were seems to have many many choices and even amongst the choices that end up 
to first pass our world there are many many choices within that from a pragmatic perspective that ends up 
like you have a theory with a lot of unexplained parameters and so one of the things still struggling 
in string theory is that really true or have we not understood theory well enough to see how to 
those parameters and the answer is we know sc yeah very hard to do experiments talking about energy scales 
beyond what we can probe at the large hadron collider for example cj yeah yeah it would be nice 
there was experimental guidance to help us fix those parameters and it could the pessimistic view is that those 
fixed and you do some experiment to figure out what those parameters are and just any number of different 
of designing a string theory to fit those parameters and so you lose predictive ability and a big discussion 
yeah as i recall there was a hope back in the i know that the theory came online in 
and it was developed but only by a small number of people in the and it exploded in popularity 
the and there was hope that it would be unique like the string theory it would just predict the 
of masses of all these different particles and so as of that seems to be unlikely right is that 
cj it seems to the best way of putting it sc it come true yet cj it come true 
well unlikely says something more than it come true talking about whether or not it will come true the 
is we know so the question is what are the prospects for the theory is it that some mechanism 
will teach us that a unique answer that string theory will produce and i think no one has or 
that necessarily close to a good idea that will tell us if some big principle missing sc but clearly 
the way phrasing this still holding out the prospect cj i think it is a possibility that that old 
could work in some shape or form my gut feeling says that by time we figure out something like 
we may not even be doing something even recognizably string theory anymore sc good right so get to that 
first we skipped over the whole thing you said cj i said sc brian green tells me so are 
guys disagreeing or cj no no not this new math at all there really is sixteen to be understood 
depending upon how you think about it there are different ways of going from that twentysix to ten but 
short version of the story is is that the theory twentysix dimension was really the first thing you write 
and you in nature in particle physics there are two broad kinds of particle things called fermions things called 
it has to do with called the spin of these particles but roughly speaking the everything that you think 
as a matter particle is actually a fermion it has called spin half or some fractional sorry some multiple 
a half spin sc half spin cj yes thank you sc so electrons neutrinos particles sc yeah i sure 
i was allowed to say integer or not overlapping conversation cj so yes electrons quarks and things like that 
the particles they exchange give rise to that we recognize as forceexchange particles actually bosons so the original string 
that were written down that are are bosonic string theories they just have that one kind but nature has 
two kinds so if you start trying to write down theories that have both kinds of particles fermions and 
as an attempt to understand nature what you find is that the theory again work very well unless you 
in ten dimensions sc so the theory has forces but not matter cj if you like yes sc and 
we want both ten dimensions seems to be the way to go cj yeah and that was what triggered 
big explosion called the first superstring revolution which so john schwartz and michael green found that the things that 
failing to work when you had both bosons and fermions in the theory go away precisely in ten dimensions 
big internal consistency thing called an anomaly which you need which comes up in quantum theories when you have 
and those go away precisely in those dimensions for very very beautiful and interesting from a technical perspective reasons 
meant that people really began to pay attention it was a consistency that was so delicate and so intricately 
together that it told you something very deep was going on sc so in some sense again the theory 
telling you what demands are it even obvious that it would work in any number of dimensions cj indeed 
sc and this is where the word super was attached to superstring cj right right and because the presence 
fermions and bosons actually have to come in a certain kind of balance it turns out a symmetry relating 
bosons and fermions which got called supersymmetry and that was a kind of symmetry that had not been thought 
before that actually was discovered in the context of string theory and turns out to be again in its 
right very interesting and we can probably talk about that too so supersymmetry was combined with string theory and 
the term superstring theory was born some of the real sort of big shots in the field started paying 
then and started making some remarkable contributions so famously when witten came into the sc ed witten yes cj 
started showing how these internal spaces where hidden six dimensions six plus four is those hidden six dimensions would 
certain important properties that he was able to characterize and then it turned out to lead to an explosion 
activity in mathematics as well because those spaces turned out to have very important mathematical properties this is actually 
birth of string theory as this other thing which is a unifier of ideas in theoretical physics and mathematics 
some other fields because it turns out that those tight consistencies begin to generate new knowledge about the mathematical 
that you can have sc and then yet another thing that the theory ended up telling us that we 
into it is that string theory is not just a theory of strings other stuff why we just stop 
the strings cj exactly so historically really interesting because people were asking that question very early on if you 
from points to lines why stop and people were coming up with all kinds of reasons why you should 
there which were not very wellmotivated were mostly due to failure of imagination and no good evidence that the 
stuff would work sc i remember in the early being in a lecture hall at a summer school and 
student asked why there twodimensional and an extremely famous string theorist name i will suppress was extremely scoffing of 
idea that we should go anywhere beyond strings cj yeah i remember being in some of those rooms and 
some of those answers and questions as well and what actually happened is the theory began to cry out 
the inclusion of those sorts of things itself so there were hints by a number of people working but 
think some of the most compelling hints were done in this beautiful paper by paul townsend and chris hull 
then edward witten very famously actually at a conference that was here at usc where i am based in 
it all together and triggered what we now call the second super string revolution cj the idea was that 
you start considering regimes which are if you like called strongly interacting regimes where the strings are not just 
with each other weakly but really really strongly you start getting into difficulties this actually happens more broadly than 
in string theory or particle physics what have you typically anything we calculate in theoretical physics is in a 
starts out in a regime called perturbation theory where you start out with the theory where nothing is interacting 
then you add sc just a bunch of particles going right by each other never bumping into each other 
we can do that cj yeah and so you get that all right and then you now get these 
to interact but we do it first very weakly we say that the noninteracting theory plus some small corrections 
sc tiny glancing blows cj yeah and actually that turns out to be incredibly powerful much of theoretical physics 
based on just doing that but there are regimes again often driven to them by the necessity to understand 
and things like that where you actually need to understand regimes where those constituents are interacting with each other 
and if you ask that question about string theory you find that a lot of the descriptions that you 
thought of in terms of strings interacting with each other are not very good descriptions at all and they 
to break down in a way that leaves you wondering what to do and so one possibility is that 
you just find sure lucky maybe in some regime and we find a strong couple description and then you 
out the answers and done cj what actually happened in this case is that we started understanding at first 
these extremes where if you try and understand strong coupling but sort of at some intermediate level the whole 
looks like a mess the basic players begin hard to tell what you lose track of who the basic 
are the basic degrees of freedom as we would say technically not clear what they are anymore but if 
just in your mind extrapolate to an extremely strongly coupled regime the theory begins to simplify again strangely and 
turns out that a way of rewriting all of that horrible mess in terms of a weakly coupled theory 
which sounds bizarre but it says what you can do is identify new players in this horrible mathematical mess 
if you describe things from their perspective the theory simplifies again sc so like if two people have never 
they are just individuals and we treat them that way if they are long fallen in love and are 
then a couple we treat them that way but when they know each other a little bit and sexual 
that things are complicated and not quite sure how to treat them cj right but if you go to 
other and trying to see where this analogy is going to laughter sc the married couple is strongly coupled 
yes but wondering what the laughter what the weakly sc weakly coupled are misanthropic people who wanna cj but 
yes hard to sort of pull these things apart the whole is greater than the sum of parts but 
the story what we found and this is something that is sort of where i came in in terms 
that stage of my career where i was very interested in strongly coupled problems you find in some of 
regimes that the new players sometimes are strings again but in some cases not strings actually extended objects higher 
membrane so either like a sheet of paper which is a two dimensional membrane or higher dimensions and because 
have ten dimensions you have many many different possibilities and it turns out when you sit down and work 
all out basically all the possibilities are in play the full description of string theory is not as a 
of strings at all a theory of all possibilities of extended objects interacting in some way it just so 
that strings are privileged by being the things that carry because of that closed loop that carry the quantum 
gravity but more than just gravity going on sc and this relationship between weekly coupled strings and strongly coupled 
things that may be strings or other things this is an example of a duality cj yeah so the 
duality is used all over our culture of course in this context it has some of that same character 
is that there are two or more aspects to the ways of looking at this whole thing and so 
in this case is saying some physics and one way of looking at it it can be described in 
of interacting strings but a different way of looking at it in which it may be interacting membranes or 
interacting set of strings that are very different from the other perspective and so these dual natures are considered 
essential to understanding what the whole thing is sc so one theory that we can talk about in two 
ways cj yes yes in some well actually i would say it differently i would say one set of 
and we have different theories that describe parts of those phenomena that sort of fit together in a patchwork 
give us an understanding of the whole thing sc is sometimes i tell me if been making a mistake 
sometimes i say that we have two different classical limits of the same underlying quantum theory overlapping conversation cj 
happy with that sure sure overlapping conversation cj you know there can be other limits that are sort of 
yeah that is a good enough sc all right good enough for podcast and i laughter sc yeah cj 
dual podcast in which i disagree sc the dual podcast is much more strongly coupled than this one is 
this is all part of this whole business with the branes cj yes sc constructed from membranes so we 
one branes are just strings two branes three branes four branes five branes etcetera and this all came in 
so the early were the first superstring revolution the were the second superstring revolution and the most famous duality 
them all came on the scene in the thanks to juan maldacena cj yeah so so one thousand nine 
ninetyfive was the revolution where we realized that branes were crucial and the many different string theories the four 
string theories that we did know about were actually parts of this big whole and people were bandying about 
term the whole thing should be called mtheory but no one knew what m stood for sc and every 
pun on the word brane appeared in a paper title cj exactly yeah sc responsible for some of those 
i was responsible for some of those puns yes but and i will get to maldacena in a moment 
worth mentioning that the really key thing i would say that stopped this from all being just nice words 
that people began to find these very very sharp computational tools that allowed you to really because previously we 
the technical ability to handle the dynamics of these higherdimensional objects which is i think why a lot of 
said well they just make sense because previous attempts just meant that it working and so famously joe polchinski 
sadly passed away this year was responsible for coming up with the technology the calculational technology that told you 
least in some regimes how to handle these different kinds of higherdimensional extended objects and describe their shapes how 
intersect it was just an amazingly powerful technology sc by the way cj yeah sc i know we use 
word but this is a different use of the word technology than some of our listeners might be familiar 
cj technical knowhow and ability so not a device in terms of a physical device but a means by 
you can calculate things sc right cj and get answers which is the meat and drink or the tofu 
cj of the theorist and so this calculational technology then began to be applied to many different things whether 
are interested in better models of how to get the standard model particle physics that heavy but also understanding 
about black holes real quantum gravity questions and so a whole story there but this amazingly is happening in 
years sc yeah cj from by we have a very nice detailed picture of how to do a lot 
things with black holes in string theory a seminal paper in by strominger and vafa and then a host 
other papers and what was beginning to emerge was this idea that another kind of duality okay well for 
reasons called gaugegravity duality which is that there are calculations you could do using gravity that will teach you 
about what are called gauge theories gauge theories are certain kinds of particle physicstype theories that you use in 
physics to calculate things they have gravity in them sc yeah the important thing so this cj exactly sc 
we say gauge theory not going to define what a gauge theory is but a certain kind of theory 
just lives in a world where you ignore gravity but you still have particles interacting with each other so 
standard meat and potatoes as you just said of particle physicists cj and the prototype example of that is 
theory of electromagnetism that is the original and arguably the best gauge theory sc yeah cj going back to 
of electromagnetism in the century so you have this powerful tool that we know works really well for particle 
it is still the thing we use to get the answers right about coming out of the large hadron 
and what have you these are gauge theories sc so all the feynman diagrams cj the feynman diagrams all 
things come from working on gauge theories so gauge theories turn out to be a key piece of the 
that describes these extended objects these branes of different kinds called dbranes that joe had found with collaborators anyway 
what was beginning to emerge when you started applying them to things like black holes etcetera was that there 
calculations you can do just using theories with no gravity these gauge theories and they will tell you about 
that have to do with gravity and that was unprecedented that was really unprecedented if you follow how string 
is built it follows from some of those very early things i was telling you about those closed loops 
from the joining of open loops sc but just i think we have to catch our breath here cj 
yeah laughter sc this is a lot to take in so we were starting with gauge theories which is 
a fancy way of saying doing particle physics without gravity okay cj mmhmm sc which means you said before 
string theory predicts gravity these even string theories these are just particle physics theories right cj yeah sc and 
look at them closely enough in the right circumstances and we realize secretly telling us something about gravity even 
gravity there cj yeah sc so mind blowing cj it is mind blowing and but it is all traceable 
to the fact that when you embed these things called gauge theories when you embed them in string theory 
is to say when because string theory contains a lot of stuff as i said coming from the vibrations 
these different kinds of strings and what have you and so some kinds of string that when you describe 
vibrations and again you look at them sort of far away enough that you realize that loops of string 
just look like little particles they will give you gauge theories and those are really the things i referred 
earlier as open strings the strings that have ends right but because string theories tell you sorry because the 
of just the laws of motion of these things tell you that they have to close up eventually they 
tell you even if you put it in that they also know about gravity sc right cj and so 
comes out of the theory at you again that was not something we went looking for it came out 
the theory and so people were beginning to understand how to handle that on a technical level better and 
and so the idea of these dualities different pictures you could use where sometimes studying the physics in terms 
gravitational physics or sometimes studying it in terms of nongravitational physics and i can get sometimes useful answers from 
perspectives that was beginning to emerge and then by late an example a very very clean and beautiful example 
this was put forward by juan maldacena which is now called the adscft correspondence and that is just a 
but a very very powerful and sharp version of this larger picture of this duality between gravity and gauge 
cj and so the adscft correspondence and the ads and the cft are technical terms which are really telling 
that i do gravity in a certain kind of space or space time which is actually called antide sitter 
a spacetime that it has a cosmological constant it has an energy density to the spacetime that turns out 
be negative and you can write it down and do things with it a it have necessarily anything to 
with our world a place in which you can do certain kinds of quantum gravity calculations and always a 
thing to be able to do but when you do those calculations including sometimes the black holes are present 
may form they may disappear all the sorts of things they can do a completely different description of that 
a theory that has no gravity in one dimension fewer and an important clue i think that we ought 
get back to in one dimension fewer which just looks like a somewhat difficult but in principle possible particle 
calculation cj and so this gives you this amazing insight into what gravity may or may not be but 
also gives you this amazing tool box sc right cj because one of the things that comes along with 
dualities is that it tells you that sometimes the easy calculations on the one side of the duality turn 
to be the hard calculation on the other side so for pragmatic reasons we like dualities usually they tell 
give us ways of calculating things that we normally get at so a piece of physics trying to describe 
is a really hard particle physics computation and it tells you this gravity computation and get the or a 
hard gravity computation and it says this particle physics calculation get the this amazingly gives you insight into a 
bunch of interesting problems that were held up for decades sc right so see if we can make sure 
understand what ads means antide sitter space so tell us a little remind us the sense in which not 
real world we live in the real world and the real world seems to have a positive energy in 
space a positive cosmological constant cj indeed and so the cosmological constant there are different ways of thinking about 
one way to thinking about it is that just some it just comes with the territory amount of energy 
where if you take a chunk of space time and you were to look at its energy content you 
find that it has some and there are three possibilities it can either be positive negative or zero sc 
in empty space the space itself cj even in empty space space itself has this energy density associated with 
and so for a long time we thought that it was zero for our world sc we notice any 
cj right we notice any and theorists being theorists then wrote many many papers saying of course laughter sc 
theory of why it must be cj right exactly and so so then observations that or at least among 
simplest explanations is that our universe actually has a small positive cosmological constant you can also write sc pushing 
universe apart accelerating galaxy cj which is one way of thinking about it is that it really sort of 
expansion of the universe the negative cosmological constant is the other possibility and so like i said it necessarily 
to have anything to do with our universe but because of this duality i was telling you about it 
you about how to do because calculations in such negative cosmological constant spaces secretly are calculating for you strongly 
particle physics questions sc right cj there are ways in which people have been using that forgetting about the 
whether or not this has anything to do with theories of everything or anything like that just an issue 
now have this tool box that tells me how to do these strongly coupled which are really important for 
things in nuclear physics are really important for understanding things in condensed metaphysics there are phases of particle physics 
a loss of electrons interacting with each other in a certain kind of medium or whether the core of 
neutron star or whether just the nuclei of our atoms cj those actually are intrinsically strongly coupled systems that 
tells us are there and we can experiment on them and they have phenomena that we understand in terms 
doing weekly coupled calculations so you need a tool that can tell you how to do some of these 
coupled calculations and there are many different kinds of tools but among the tools are now thinking about them 
terms of these dual theories of gravity sc right so still not completely convinced that we all know what 
is so gonna keep hounding on this sorry cj oh oh okay yeah fine sc so ads we say 
spacetime with a negative cosmological constant so not like a place you can go not like a location in 
universe this is a hypothetical universe right that we physicists can write down the equations for and basically an 
universe except that a negative energy in empty space itself what antide sitter space is right cj yes yes 
a person named de cj yes sc one hundred years ago and he invented de sitter space and now 
just change the sign cj you change the sign and a whole lot of things change when you change 
simple sign sc exactly cj yeah sc and this might even be dangerous to say but maybe better to 
up the confusions and fix them than to pretend that not there if a positive cosmological constant accelerates things 
why a negative cosmological constant just cause the universe to recollapse into a big crunch cj oh a good 
i have to think laughter cj to think about a good way of thinking about that sc i mean 
short answer is that it does if other stuff in the universe right cj yeah yeah yeah trying to 
to think sort of famously when you start adding things you will get instabilities sc right cj trying to 
in some ways why the pure case is still quite robust sc kind of nothing to crunch cj yeah 
guess nothing to crunch yeah a good way of putting it yeah yeah yeah sc so we have an 
big cj yeah sc with negative energy everywhere and saying that a theory of gravity of quantum gravity in 
space is dual too which is another way of saying is sort of physically the same but written in 
different way as a theory with no gravity at all in one less dimension so if we had a 
sitter space that would be dual to a quantum field theory cj yeah sc and problems that are hard 
one theory might be easy in the other one and vice versa and now we have this way of 
hard problems and mapping them on to easy problems so this is full employment for theoretical physicists cj yeah 
mean ultimately really all we do laughter cj we find tools for doing being able to calculate in various 
and understand things and much of the rest is decoration sc but the word holography also used overlapping conversation 
i was gonna get to that because one of the things it also tells us is that worrying about 
dimension of spacetime itself may be a red herring i personally think this is all a clue that when 
started going string theory has this number of dimensions and you hit a bunch of them what have i 
one day understand that all a red herring sc overrated spacetime is overrated cj yeah well dimension itself is 
that is going to be somewhat in the eye of the beholder and we already see it in this 
you do these calculations in one of these gauge theories so you start out for example trying to understand 
phenomena in three plus one dimensional spacetime you think surely the right way because we live in three plus 
dimensions and you do the calculation and it goes off to strong coupling and you have good experimental reason 
want to know what the answers are in strong coupling and then someone comes along and says for that 
phenomenon here is a way of understanding it but got to work with a fivedimensional theory of gravity and 
not what anyone ordered cj right and you might go just or you might go just want something that 
tell me what the answers and so you just hold your nose the wrong number of dimensions and the 
of gravity which where i started but from a pragmatic perspective telling you that you can get answers to 
phenomenon nature care whether you label it with this number of dimensions on whether this is gravity or not 
just nature sc right cj i think where being led sc yeah cj and we saw that also with 
it particles is it strings is it membranes is it what have you nature care sc and this is 
of and i think this is the single hardest thing for people and the public to get as to 
string theorists are so excited been an antistring theory backlash there was a pro string theory counter backlash cj 
lash sc the elegant universe came along people were very very excited cj right sc nova special etcetera and 
there were these books against it and people got upset but when in the trenches doing string theory this 
that you wrote down in the keeps pushing us in interesting directions that we even anticipated cj yeah sc 
smells like something right is going on and maybe maybe not right always possible at the end of the 
going to be experiments that decide but really good reasons to think that not just all an accident that 
this is working out cj yeah not only is it not an accident not that being misled by a 
set of senior people what have you because the point is that this is theoretical physics so you can 
those calculations and the calculations themselves are telling you going on sc right cj some visionary senior people may 
you to look at those calculations but then very rapidly you get up to speed and you say this 
is and then for your own reasons depending upon your own flavor of physics that led you to where 
are you go something really interesting in here and more than meets the and so i think historically this 
an interesting time because i think we really are chipping away at corners of something that i think is 
larger much more interesting and none of us know where going to go and yes but it is certainly 
case it could turn out all to be wrong sc right cj but i suspect even if it turns 
to be wrong in the sense of it good for the thing that we thought it was going to 
good for be surprised if it gonna be good for something sc well you made the point that we 
technology in this sense and can now be applied to problems that are other than the big bang or 
gravity right cj yeah sc and so just give us just one example for us to fix our minds 
from your work or from somewhere else about how we can use say adscft this duality between particle physics 
gravity to answer some tangible questions about physics cj yeah well so there are a number of regions where 
think a lot of the work is just that one step further than maybe sort of qualitative in the 
that there are kinds of behavior that you would like to classify like to understand at least what the 
are that you see in strongly coupled systems in real experiments so people actually make their condensed matter people 
worry about clumps of material that where the electrons are doing stuff in some strange way and some new 
of way they behave as a result of them interacting strongly that like to understand sc but talking about 
people in real labs cj these are sc not fivedimensional fake cj yeah these are real people in real 
building stuff that may be in your phone one day sc right cj or something like that and then 
the other hand there are questions to do with the kinds of things that can happen when you take 
of nuclear material quarks interacting strongly and clump them together now one example is just nuclei themselves the nuclei 
atoms but you also have nuclear material doing interesting things in astrophysics you get entire ten miles across lumps 
nuclear material condensed together called neutron stars that we now actually observed them colliding sc oh yeah cj in 
physics sc gravitational waves yeah cj and that may be the place where a huge amount of the heavy 
you know gold famously and what have you that we see here on earth actually came from all of 
have to do with phases of strongly coupled matter that we know take place in nature and we have 
descriptions of so there are many many different kinds of possibilities and working with these dual theories at least 
you enumerate the kinds of possibilities they get the answers right on the nose because these systems are typically 
complicated and have many more components than we can handle computationally but there are broad brush strokes you wanna 
right initially like what is even possible what kinds of phases of these different kinds of matter exotic matter 
you like can you get and previously we had no good tools for enumerating those phases very nicely one 
that you do get out of these kinds of strongly couple of models sc i see that you wrote 
paper with neutron stars in the title is that true cj have i written a paper with neutron stars 
the title i remember i have been thinking about neutron stars i plan to write some papers on neutron 
sc but this is the kind of things that literally using the tools we learn from string theory to 
the neutron stars out there in the sky cj yeah yeah so some of my earliest work was very 
on when this adscft stuff came out figured out ways with some colleagues of working out what the physicists 
call the phase diagram which is essentially a diagram of the possibilities the kinds of phases so famously phases 
it has a solid form it has a liquid form it has a gaseous form you can actually workout 
phase diagram of water under various this pressure and this temperature form is it so you can work that 
you need to know that to understand water if you really claim to understand water so you need to 
that for nuclear physics as well so some of the various earliest work was the stuff i was involved 
in showing that this in principle could help you get the phase diagram of the core of a neutral 
right in principle cj this was again broad brushstrokes because i was convinced that that would be a really 
application for some of this stuff now as i said this is a broad brushstrokes a lot to be 
sc sure cj been happening really very recently which i think is very exciting is the whole business of 
able to calculate very difficult quantum sorry yep quantum mechanical diagnostic tools as it were in field theories again 
colleagues in the experimental world of various kinds want to know when these different phases are happening or about 
happen or about to be changed from one phase to another what do you keep track of to figure 
going on how do you characterize these things a lot of the traditional phases of matter are typically that 
learn about in school and what have you have to do with things being driven by very classical sorts 
things that are going on now a lot of these new phases are driven by quantum effects sc right 
harder cj harder and harder to calculate sc yeah cj and so there are very important quantities called entanglement 
are the things that we like to we think it would be good to keep track of it turns 
these are really hard things to calculate in field theories outside twodimensional field theories where it turns out that 
you can use one of the really big things been happening in the last just few years i would 
has been the explosion of methods using gravity duals of calculating these quantum diagnostic things cj things like entanglement 
and various cousins of entanglement entropy and you use these now as the things you track to see when 
degrees of freedom are rearranging themselves and a new phase is coming up gonna be hugely important i think 
an application on the quantum side but then also been turning it on its head because i think people 
beginning to realize that keeping track of quantum degrees of freedom may be a more arguably fundamental way of 
track of going on on the spacetime side gravity actually doing sc right cj and so becoming also important 
understanding what truly are black holes in string theory and hopefully what truly black holes are quantum mechanically and 
like that sc fuzzballs are in the news the black holes might be fuzzy balls of string cj yeah 
this is again something that is hugely important i going back to where we embedded black holes in string 
now with the new knowledge that strings is more than strings all of these other kinds of things and 
realize that we could understand a number of the fundamental things that bekenstein and hawking had said about black 
and quantum mechanics back in the we understood how to actually prove some of those things they said in 
that was started with strominger and beautiful paper cj and then what happened is that we sort of forgot 
of the lessons that we learned from that paper and some of the followup papers and then we started 
black holes and quantum mechanics again what are black holes quantum information paradox and samir mathur pointed out that 
if we go back to that original picture of strominger and vafa and just follow what the string theory 
you it tells you something quite remarkable which is that all of that stuff you used to build the 
holes out of these strings interacting with membranes and what have you if you follow what those things do 
tells you that black holes really in some sense are themselves emergent phenomena not really real they are the 
of taking the classical limit and going to general relativity in some sense and overlapping conversation sc i think 
phenomena are real fundamental laughter cj yeah yes i try to shy away from the word fundamental sc you 
fiftynine minutes without using the word cj yeah yeah and so that all sounds a bit woolly but the 
result is again in a way maybe again a kind of a duality if interested in astrophysical problems that 
far away from the business of quantum effects sure use general relativity and that solution that schwarzschild taught us 
the black hole with a horizon and do a good job if interested in understanding the internal structure of 
black hole from a quantummechanical perspective not good enough and what this picture coming from string theory tells you 
that you build black holes out of these fuzzy kinds of domains that you can actually describe in string 
in a way the stringiness makes it all very fuzzy and when you put lots of it together and 
a little bit it effectively looks like the thing you call a black hole with a sharp horizon cj 
if you look closely enough see that actually there is no horizon the horizon is just this effective thing 
describes the collective phenomena coming from all of those things interacting together and in some ways it immediately tells 
that the black hole information paradox a paradox at all just a paradox that is forced upon you by 
that approximation of pretending a horizon effectively where there really sc so speaking of the real world in it 
a professor and you have to go teach a class so i really wanted to talk about the fact 
you wrote a graphic cj i have a little more time sc you have a little cj not too 
away and students start turning up for at least another few minutes after class sc you know how much 
you have so mention it in the intro but tell us a little bit it comes out of your 
to have everyone be enthusiastic about physics and string theory but you wrote a graphic novel and you illustrated 
cj yeah in some ways the illustrated and graphic part of it the driving force so much as my 
with the fact that the kind of books we write as sort of professional theorists who want to tell 
exciting things about what doing always inviting you to be part of the conversation and what i really wanted 
do was have something that was more conversational in some ways that it i want it to just to 
the voice of the expert telling you what to think about stuff nothing wrong with that kind of book 
several probably write overlapping conversation sc gonna talk and gonna listen do not read the comments cj and so 
wanted to in some ways i realized that it would be fun to revisit this ancient form which is 
dialogue form where you actually as a reader you end up eavesdropping on a conversation between people about ideas 
in some sense that gives you multiple voices and different points of view and it helps you unpack the 
in a way that i think is not done as much as i think would be nice in sort 
contemporary writing so that was the idea sc i have long had the ambition of writing a book in 
form my publisher does not want me to do it working on it it would not be illustrated but 
pulled it off so jealous cj well you know thank you and yes a lot of publishers in fact 
of them just get it they get what i was trying to do and worse it had all these 
because then i thought because i was thinking actually what would be really great would be to see that 
conversations when we do think of the dialogues going back to the ancients we think of people in togas 
mountain tops having deep conversations about philosophy and i wanted to go you can have conversations but they are 
place in the contemporary world in cafes and museums and on buses and trains where we all cj and 
just taking place in labs and conference rooms and what have you and then the other thing was it 
be ordinary people and it would be great if you could see these people in these places so that 
the whole package and i thought clearly this would be narrative art it would be a graphic novel style 
sc and be talking about string theory cj and so they string theory is in there but it a 
about string theory it is one of many things that people talk about in these conversations the other great 
about conversations is that conversations have a sign post telling what about one of the great things about science 
that interconnected you start talking about one thing and you end up in this other place and all been 
hopefully laughter cj and so that messiness of conversation i also thought would be fun to have and then 
final thing sort of bubbling is the fact that i think these conversations really do happen a big people 
i sit in cafes and i end up listening to people and science does come up and you hear 
neither of them are experts but they want to engage with this stuff they saw a tv show or 
read a book and they want to talk more about these ideas and so one of the things frustrating 
that no one celebrates that these conversations are taking place so i wanted a book that really celebrates the 
of those conversations invites people to have their own and gives you a snapshot of some of those conversations 
through and seeing going on so that was the idea and people seem to like it sc yeah they 
happen these conversations and they happen enough and we can encourage them a little bit more and so called 
dialogues cj yeah dialogues subtitle about the nature of the sc available wherever books are available cj wherever books 
available and you will find some book stores where in the science section and some book stores where in 
graphic novel section just ask for it sc just ask okay cj and if they have it tell them 
order a bunch other people will find them and usually really really love it once they find it sc
