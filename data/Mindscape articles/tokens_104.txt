episode click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everybody and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean 
a few years ago i was being interviewed on camera for a tv show a documentary about physics and 
were talking about black holes and crazy things about quantum mechanics and some speculative ideas and during a break 
director said to me love doing shows on this kind of topic but my brain always hurts just so 
to think about this and i said immediately you know how i feel every day what i do for 
living when not podcasting thinking about theoretical physics and crazy sc and physics works at the boundaries of what 
know physics is driven by puzzles and mysteries by things that we yet understand if lucky those puzzles come 
experiments we get some data that we fit together that quite make sense in our current conception so we 
to improve our theories but sometimes we have two theories that individually make perfect sense but fit together that 
the case with perhaps the single biggest looming question in modern theoretical physics how we reconcile quantum mechanics our 
theory of how the world works at a fundamental level especially at the level of tiny particles in the 
realm and gravity the theory that is explained by albert theory of general relativity the idea that space and 
are curved what we want is to fit them together to have a theory of quantum gravity that somehow 
world is fundamentally quantum mechanical and it gives rise to curved spacetime that we notice as gravity sc the 
is you try to do that using the techniques that work for other theories of physics you quantize general 
and it seem to work so for decades now physicists have been trying to ask how do we find 
quantum theory of gravity one of the biggest experts in this field is guest carlo rovelli dr rovelli is 
professor at if i can say this correctly the centre de physique théorique de luminy of aixmarseille university in 
although originally italian as he will explain carlo was a bit of a rabblerouser as a youth he has 
fiery italian temperament but these days he works on reconciling albert general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics 
the way dr rovelli has written several books his two thousand fourteen book seven brief lessons in physics was 
runaway new york times bestseller he just has a book that came out called the order of time on 
nature of time and therefore of course spacetime which is important for understanding quantum gravity the latest news i 
was that the audio book version of the order of time is going to be read by the actor 
cumberbatch as a fellow book author who has to read his own books this makes me very jealous sc 
what talk about with dr rovelli is the subject of quantum gravity as i alluded to given some thing 
we think we understand electromagnetism or the nuclear forces a cookbook procedure for taking that classical theory and quantizing 
it breaks down when you try to do this for gravity so what do you do this is a 
topic in theoretical physics today the most popular answer as you may have heard is something called string theory 
grew directly out of particle physics just by saying that we should replace the idea of little point particles 
the most fundamental ingredients of nature with little pieces of vibrating string that sounds like a crazy speculative idea 
it leads you directly to predict the existence of gravity so who knows it seems to be very promising 
it exactly let us say to be very modest about it explained all the things you want to explain 
the universe sc so dr rovelli is a champion of a different perspective called loop quantum gravity he was 
of the originators of this idea relatively straightforward in its approach it says take general relativity we know what 
is einstein gave it to us and maybe the reason why it fails when we try to straightforwardly quantize 
is just that not quite clever enough maybe there is a not quite straightforward way of taking general relativity 
plugging it into the rules of quantum mechanics sc so loop quantum gravity right now is sort of a 
minority point of view not nearly as popular as string theory is but to be very fair we know 
is right certainly a respectable thing and given that we know the answer important that we pursue lots of 
possibilities maybe going to be the case that some hybrid version of both string theory and loop quantum gravity 
eventually turn out to be right maybe the techniques from one will be very useful in the other one 
asked carlo about this in the podcast interview and he immediately slapped me down he was not in favor 
the idea that string theory and loop quantum gravity will be some day reconciled but also a fair guy 
knows that we have to keep an open mind about these things sc since we know how to quantize 
perhaps it comes down to taste in the sense of different important principles of quantum mechanics of gravity that 
have to be reconciled some of them are gonna go some of them are gonna be preserved which ones 
most important why important that we have different people working on different approaches because we yet know which one 
going to be correct so solving the biggest outstanding puzzle in theoretical physics today our podcast topic go music 
carlo rovelli welcome to the mindscape podcast carlo rovelli thank you sean sc very yeah very great to have 
here both at a conference on the nature of time and the observer so taking the opportunity to sit 
with one of the experts in quantum gravity and have a chat cr fantastic sc so why we start 
with you explaining to the audience hopefully a broad audience and they might not be physics aficionados just who 
are how you got to be where you are what your interests are very briefly cr i am italian 
started my life and career in italy in physics sort of late because i was not a nerd at 
focused on science i was interested in everything i moved to the united states i was a faculty in 
for about ten years and i moved back to france now living in france and quantum gravity has been 
interest my focus my passion and my obsession all through my life sc all through your life all through 
life at cr well from the moment i got interested in this sc was there a thing that got 
interested cr yes i first i sort of got in love with quantum mechanics and general relativity when i 
these things i said this is incredible this the world is different than what we think and and then 
was a student and i stumbled upon a review paper by chris isham a london physicist at the time 
were very few people who were interested in quantum gravity sc so what year are we talking cr something 
that and chris isham was a little bit of the guru of quantum gravity at the time and he 
this fantastic review paper which he was explaining the problem and i read it i understand much of course 
it said space and time are not what you think they are even after einstein even after quantum mechanics 
more than that it said space and time we yet know what they are not sure what they are 
here is a fantastic open problem the core of modern physics we understand the basic grammar of the universe 
i said this is what i wanna do with the rest of my and actually i did sc very 
i think that we can all agree the reconciliation of quantum mechanics and gravity is one of the great 
of modern physics right now it has been for quite a while get there sort of by starting with 
quantum mechanics and explaining gravity maybe gravity is easier to do first so what would be the hardest cr 
quantum mechanics is hard sc well we will have a discussion about quantum cr get to that yes sc 
on gravity cr gravity is sort of easier gravity what we understand about gravity is a stroke of a 
by einstein that he got between one thousand nine hundred ten and and what happened is this that newton 
introduced this idea of a space in which we live and an absolute time which passes independently of everything 
was a newtonian idea not an older idea because before him space was just sort of how things are 
who is next to whom and time was just sort of counting things that happened sc a label yeah 
right so day night day night and you count them one two three and time which means that if 
happens no time right but newton introduced this idea that time is time by itself and space is space 
itself is there even if there is nothing else and einstein ten years earlier had figured out with space 
that space and time you can view them pretty much in a single thing that today we call minkowski 
which is a sort of background of the world on which things things have all happened and einstein was 
by theory by electromagnetism which was not very old at his time because it was what forty years old 
like that so much less old than what general relativity and quantum mechanics are for today sc yeah so 
put together electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism roughly cr right sc yeah and so einstein is thinking turn of 
century cr right at turn of the century forty years later and however the success of theory was immense 
because immediately it was used for technology there were electric engine in fact the father of einstein was building 
plants in northern italy he was working with the maxwell equation sc well there would be no podcasts without 
so cr there would be no podcasts without electromagnetism right without an understanding of electromagnetism and the idea of 
and faraday was that there is this field so electromagnetism is a field something that is all over it 
move according to the equation that maxwell wrote and faraday was visualizing the field as a sort of web 
lines going all over a very very fine infinitely fine sort of and immersed in this field and einstein 
that gravity also should be describe by a field showed gravitation as a field somehow and he asked himself 
to describe this field and then he got the stroke of genius the stroke of genius is that einstein 
spacetime and the gravitational field are actually the same thing a stroke general relativity as i understand it cr 
in fact generally it is presented in books by saying gravitational field is nothing else than but i like 
to think of it the other way around spacetime nothing else than gravitational field the same thing right when 
understand that those things are the same you can say it two different ways sc so einstein is saying 
gravity is not a thing that lives in spacetime a manifestation of the nature of spacetime itself cr exactly 
one additional thing that lives in spacetime a manifestation of newtonian space and time this clear background that newton 
us is there is actually there but is the gravitational field same thing as the gravitational field which means 
can move it can stretch it can bend and einstein wrote the equation for that and this is a 
wave the black hole sort of things so one ingredient sc yeah onboard with so the easy part right 
the easy part laughter sc we give this great credit to einstein in around one thousand nine hundred fifteen 
so he finally put the finishing touches on general relativity one of the great intellectual accomplishments of history and 
of that is that it was almost a singular genius right einstein have a lot of competition while he 
doing it but at the same time as richard feynman famously said the day after he did it lots 
people understood what he had done it was a clear thing in some sense even though a different notion 
spacetime general relativity is still within the classical newtonian paradigm of physics something spacetime it has properties it has 
and you can measure it as precisely as you want and then we come to quantum mechanics which is 
wholly different thing and why you tell us what quantum mechanics is cr quantum mechanics is a thing that 
said nobody understands it sc that was the followup to that quote right cr right which means that everybody 
it but everybody in a different manner so to say quantum mechanics which also owes a lot to einstein 
was the first who really understood that it was needed and he made the first steps in my understanding 
mechanics it tell us three things about the world which we know before and sort of the mathematical representation 
these three things the first thing in my opinion not sure in the full majority from this perspective but 
think is crucial is that a lot of things are discrete quantum quantum so the first thing that it 
telling us for instance is this electromagnetic field that maxwell and faraday described so well and that makes the 
turn and that makes a radio work actually in some sense made by little packets which are the photons 
einstein was the first one to introduce the notion of photons and now we know that when light falls 
me it actually falls not as a continuous things but like little rain a granular tick tick many little 
that sc so by the way already i disagree laughter cr i know sc with what you say i 
this is great though certainly it was one of the things that inspired people to get quantum mechanics the 
quantum right the fact that classically you have an electromagnetic wave coming from a light bulb and you see 
as light but experimentally if you just look at it carefully enough really really dim light it comes in 
cr it comes in packets sc you see these little blobs you see something smooth and then the interpretive 
is which is real is it the wave or the particle and then how do we think about that 
not get bogged down in that quite yet cr right right yes in fact i started by saying this 
in my opinion a central aspect of quantum mechanics but not sure in the majority here another way of 
this is that up to quantum mechanics we thought that we could describe systems arbitrarily well the state of 
system with arbitrary precision we could measure position and velocity of a particle or measure anything arbitrarily well and 
possible state of the system the possible outcome of the measurement are described as something we call the phase 
which is the space of all possible results and the dimension of the phase space is action and the 
of quantum mechanics is a constant which is the planck constant which has the dimension of an action which 
a little volume in phase space if i have one degree of freedom the space of possible state i 
think after quantum mechanics that there is a sort of minimal volume into it so it forbids us to 
things more precisely about the state of something sc and this is compatible this is of a sense with 
idea that the essence of quantum mechanics is this chunkiness this discreteness yes cr the chunkiness right so the 
the constant of planck which is a constant that characterizes the quantum phenomena ask when in a quantum regime 
when away a measure of the chunkiness of reality in some sense another way of viewing things sc so 
transforms from the smooth fields of faraday to a pixelated timeframe view of things cr to the pixelated things 
if it was only that it would be comprehensible but it is not only that cr so there are 
more steps and the second step also is comprehensible and sean i believe you might disagree with this as 
sc ready ready to disagree cr alright so the second step let me say in a way that you 
disagree is that we cannot make predictions about the future quite fundamentally sc right cr not just because we 
precisely enough not because we know the calculations but if we make everything we can on a physical system 
we control it perfectly and we know its physics as best as we can today nevertheless what gonna see 
has a margin of indeterminacy sc we can make predictions but at best approximate some probability cr we can 
in fact we do make predictions quantum mechanics allow us to make prediction not that there is no prediction 
the other way around but there is always some uncertainty that remains which we can make small but not 
this is the famous nondeterminism of quantum mechanics and a second discovery of the world i would say and 
think phrased it in a way that you may agree sc i think if you phrase it in the 
of predictions everyone had better agree yeah right cr exactly sc and then again going on underneath cr going 
underneath is a different story and the third and here we come to the hardest because so far alright 
a world pixeled and unpredictable is still a comprehensible world which shock us too much but the third is 
most shocking one and in my opinion the third discovery of quantum mechanics is that it describes how properties 
systems have properties but these properties in the language of the textbook of quantum mechanics these properties become actual 
real when you measure them now measuring a nonsense world because what does nature know about me measuring sc 
sound like some concept you want as part of your fundamental description of the world cr no no so 
that and in my opinion what the theory is telling us is that property become concrete when two systems 
and this so far so sc so replacing measurement with interaction cr you replace measurement with interaction but to 
the machine work you have to assume that when two systems interact the property of one system becomes actual 
respect to the other system and not with respect to everything else and that point is really shocking laughter 
right cr and that point is really shocking now i think if one accepts this idea which is my 
of viewing quantum mechanics which i know is not the universal way not yours in particular then it what 
mechanics is telling us sc but not so far from mine in that part in the sense that i 
an everettian a believer in the many worlds interpretation at least i think my favorite happy to change my 
some day down the road but everett himself when he invented it in the when he published his paper 
called it the relative state interpretation and the point that he was trying to emphasize was that what you 
is only relative to the thing seeing it this interaction creates an impression of the measurement outcome that is 
part of the relationship between the thing that is doing the measuring and the thing that is being observed 
i think that some similarity of words there cr some similarities i talk for you but let me try 
for one second i think what you would add to what i say is that you want to take 
realist position where beyond that there is nevertheless a deterministic nonrelational overall quantum state of the system that we 
take as the proper description of reality sc i would like to say that cr would that be so 
yeah i would a realist i even imagine what it would be like to be a scientist and not 
a realist about reality laughter and yet i cr right so i would like to be a realist but 
radically so let me say two things there are a lot of quantities in physics which are relational we 
that they are the velocity of an object is not a property of the object no sense in which 
velocity of an object is a property of the sc depends on who is measuring cr right and in 
this is a good example because here we use measuring but of course it has nothing to do with 
the velocity of an object is a property of an object with respect to another object sc yes cr 
i can say that the earth is set to velocity with respect to the sun but the sun is 
measuring not going out with meters and kilometers so we use this language measuring and we interpret this language 
say that some properties are relational i want to be a realist about relational properties and i want to 
of reality in a realistic way perhaps a little bit closer than you to our direct experience of reality 
see the photons coming in i see the table being the sc i see our direct experience of reality 
tremendously overrated frankly laughter cr and so i find that if we want to be a realist about the 
function we actually let me step back for a moment i think given the strangeness of quantum mechanics any 
we think it is comes with a price so we have options we have a number of options and 
have been talking about two options okay the sort of many world interpretation in which you have this wave 
of everything which come with a price or the sort of strictly relational view which i described which also 
with a price and there are others and they have their own price sc right right cr and many 
about quantum mechanics are which price are we ready to and the price of the relational interpretation i described 
this weakening of realism so to say what the state of the well i know it matter it have 
state it only has a state with respect to a and it is the same with respect b and 
is the same with respect to c and there is no solid objective overall picture the price of the 
world interpretation is that i have to sc many worlds cr in some sense all these many worlds sc 
absolutely a big price a big price cr so it comes with an enormous ontology a very heavy ontology 
which price do we wanna pay in one way or the other it contradicts our previous way of thinking 
reality sc absolutely and so i agree more about the idea that there is a price to be paid 
could disagree a little bit about the heaviness of the ontology that is associated with many worlds but i 
that this is a good lesson because all we need for conversation is the clear fact that we have 
the same time a way to do quantum mechanics we use quantum mechanics as physicists every day been spectacularly 
experimentally we know how to use it we have a recipe we have a black box cr yeah and 
works it works fantastically well sc and we have anything close to an agreement on what it is what 
fundamentals of it really say so that will be a wonderful thing to figure out once and for all 
maybe we need to do that for the question of quantizing gravity so just to put the puzzle the 
in perspective since we grew up we human beings as classical people classical mechanics was invented first it is 
intuitive to us even if pendulums and inclined planes tortured us as undergraduates we kind of get it in 
fundamental visceral way so we always start by thinking about systems from this classical point of view and then 
quantize them we elevate the classical description to some quantum mechanical theory now presumably nature or god work that 
cr work that way sc right nature just is quantum and we can look for classical limits but nevertheless 
poor benighted human beings given the classical system we want to quantize it and we have ways of doing 
there are again cookbooks recipes that work and then you apply this way to this wonderful thing called general 
theory of gravity and we hit road blocks so this is why quantum gravity is hard and i guess 
around the would be when people first started seriously thinking about it and not decades later was any kind 
progress really made would you agree with that cr yes when people started thinking the first who realized there 
a problem not surprisingly is albert einstein himself who in wrote what we call today the basic equation of 
relativity and one year later in he wrote a paper well of course this is an approximation because gravity 
have quantum properties quite remarkable because quantum mechanics within textbook came out ten years later sc well he had 
photons so inventing gravitons be that hard right cr he had already invented photons and there was already the 
that things were quantized at small scale in some sense and a beautiful page by einstein in which he 
in incredible clarity that in the future his own theory has to be corrected to take into account of 
mechanics and here we are sc one hundred years cr here we are one hundred years later but right 
remains an isolated thing though there was some people thinking about that in the both in russia and in 
west rosen had a paper which started studying it but especially bronstein matvei sc okay in russia yes cr 
yes he was a friend of landau and the first one who figured out that quantum gravity namely finding 
quantum property of the gravitational field had to imply some radical revision of space and time and he said 
openly a nice story because it comes from a mistake by landau sc for the listeners lev landau a 
physicist one of the great minds of century physics and make a lot of mistakes cr no sc so 
mistake by landau was a big deal cr right a big deal in fact in fact but you know 
physicists do make mistake sc we all do cr einstein made all sort of sc and he was the 
yeah cr right he was the best in doing mistakes and getting results maybe the things go together when 
mechanics started to be understood the formulas and the mathematics landau assumed that because of quantum mechanics it should 
been impossible to measure the value of a field the electric field in a point and bohr who was 
big father of quantum mechanics immediately understood that this was wrong and it was a long discussion and bohr 
rosenfeld wrote a paper showing that that landau was wrong and landau recognized that but bronstein who was a 
of landau immediately said do the same for and there landau is right there is a sense in which 
cannot measure the gravitational field in a point because points lose their meaning in quantum gravity sc where is 
point right cr and why points lose their meaning in quantum gravity is because the gravitational field is also 
the gravitational field live in space but is space itself so in the moment in which you look at 
quantum properties of the gravitational field also looking at the quantum property of spacetime of space and one a 
modern way of viewing what he was doing is the following if you try to pinpoint the position of 
particle in arbitrary small precision you can but because of quantum mechanics the velocity of the particle becomes very 
but the velocity is also the momentum and the momentum is also the energy so you have a very 
energy so to say and a very large energy because of gravity energy is also mass is mc squared 
like having a large mass and if you have a large mass in a small area you create a 
hole so when you try to zoom in a point very too small automatically you create a little black 
and if you work out the numbers you look at a scale and a minimal scale you can look 
right sc yes so quantum gravity sort of asserts itself when you try to localize things too carefully in 
the idea of having a location seems something that is so intrinsic to how the world works that i 
say and probably agree that even today modern researchers who talk about quantum gravity very often secretly have in 
some spacetime manifold that has much more reality than it should according to the rules of quantum gravity cr 
agree and i would say how would i put this way a lot of my career has been fighting 
this temptation sc although to be fair einstein was on the other side right cr yes einstein was on 
other side sc einstein himself was heartbroken at the prospect that if there were a quantum theory of gravity 
would lose its primacy he really and he had a right because he was the boss of spacetime to 
that without a notion of where you are in space if that were not fundamental he quite see how 
to do physics but certainly at the intuitive level it seems that that is how quantum gravity should work 
right right sc so do you think you know how to quantize gravity cr do i think i know 
to quantize so let me put it this way me and my friends a good group of friends in 
few decades we have put together a tentative set of equations that can be written on a single piece 
paper which are a tentative solution of the problem now do i hope this to be a quantum theory 
gravity yes i definitely do do i think it might be a quantum theory of gravity yes i do 
i sure this is a good quantum theory of gravity no not at all sc be coy you should 
what the name of your theory is cr loop quantum gravity sc loop quantum gravity cr loop quantum gravity 
so loop quantum gravity has been born from the early attempt in the and the that you mentioned from 
work of william dewitt and many other people but then has evolved into a more precise mathematical structure to 
the quanta of gravity this granular structure of spacetime because in well what photons are for the electromagnetic field 
think there should be analogous quanta for the gravitational field but a specific characteristic of loop quantum gravity since 
gravitational field does not live in spacetime not a field in spacetime but spacetime itself the quanta do not 
in space or in spacetime they are themselves spacetime so they should be not confused with the gravitons which 
sort of a first approximation to quantum gravity which are little particles like photons that move in space they 
very very very much brothers of photons the quanta of gravity in loop quantum gravity are the grains out 
which space or the gravitational field is built and they are discrete so that they cannot be further cut 
smaller pieces sc so that pixel granular structure is right cr the pixel granular structure is right there at 
beginning and we have a state in a hilbert space the mathematics of quantum mechanics that describe this pixelated 
and the space of our experience is like the many pixels seen from a large distance when you see 
more the discreteness sc like a good high resolution tv screen cr like a high resolution tv screen which 
nice and smooth and continuous sc right cr but if you go very very close you see the individual 
sc and is there a way to concisely explain the word in the phrase loop quantum gravity cr yes 
first of all it has remained a little bit historically now less loopy than in the beginning sc in 
sense yes cr in some sense right or more loopy i know the loop comes from this the pixels 
are how would i say they know who is next to who they know who is next to who 
one can represent that with the links from loop to loop so you have all these dots linked to 
another it forms a net in fact we call them network or more precisely spin network spin because something 
the mathematical spin in describing it so imagine this network and if you start from one of the pixel 
go around link link link link and loop back you make a loop so these are the loops on 
quantum gravity and historically the first mathematical description of these things that were found were only single sort of 
along a loop individual loops this is when ted jacobson and lee smolin stumbled upon a solution of what 
considered at the time the main equation of quantum gravity which is called the wheelerdewitt equation cr and these 
depended on loops and so we started wondering what are these loops and slowly we realized that these are 
quanta these can be thought as the individual quanta of space and in fact they just loop or not 
link but they can cross so better to think as a network than a set of loops sc and 
know that at least at some point in the development of the theory there was an image of almost 
chain mail in the sense that there were little loops that sort of tied around each other and that 
space its effective geometry and reality is that still how things are thought of now or has that kind 
evaporated cr yes yes a little less chain maily chain mails as before because at the beginning we were 
really with still loops and we were thinking of loops sort of linked to one another i remember some 
i was in verona and i decided to buy a large number of key rings and attached one to 
other to make a sort of threedimensional chain mail sc this is what remembering good cr yeah and then 
was going i gave a talk in princeton going with my chain mail and john wheeler who was a 
grandfather of thinking about when he saw it he was very excited because he said yes how i think 
space at the very very and he ran away and came with a copy of his book i know 
but in his book there is a picture that he drew decades before which is a sort of chain 
sc alright so inevitable to mention that once you have these little onedimensional loops it almost begins to sound 
string theory cr it begins to sound like string theory right because these loops are made by lines and 
strings the first difference with respect to at least to old string theory to how people started thinking of 
theory at the beginning is that a string a closed string is a little loop but a little loop 
moves in space sc right cr while these do not move in space they make space themselves sc yeah 
i think exactly right cr a core difference the original difference you see string theory did not grow as 
attempt to solve quantum gravity it came from another way sort of stumbled on a possible solution of quantum 
which is a reason for taking it seriously right the fact but it originated from the effort of making 
unified theory of the different forces and the different pieces of the standard model and gravity so people who 
in string theory especially at the beginning were not how would i say were mostly thinking in a sort 
pregeneral relativistic way this is spacetime and over spacetime there are things that move and while loop quantum gravity 
more from the core general relativistic world where there is no fixed spacetime on which things happen spacetime itself 
something that we sc let me give my version i think interesting to explore this rivalry as it were 
quantum gravity and string theory safe to say are the two leading candidates just in terms of voting by 
doing these in terms of quantum gravity cr yeah in terms of number of sc and like you say 
quantum gravity arose out of a fairly direct approach to the question of how to reconcile gravity in quantum 
we knew gravity einstein had this theory of general relativity we have rules for quantizing things they instantly work 
you apply those rules to general relativity but then you be clever and people like lee smolin and ted 
and abhay ashtekar get lots of credit and yourself as well and you sift through the subtleties here and 
find ways to get a quantum mechanical theory that really respects the quantum nature of spacetime itself and this 
the goal and not trying to do a theory of everything cr no not at all not at all 
at all sc not trying to also explain quarks and leptons right not even trying to explain the possibility 
extra dimensions you think i see the three dimensions of space and the one of time work and that 
the attitude that was taken whereas string theory as you said started in the and with this idea that 
originally based on data data from the strong interactions of particle physics the interactions that keep the quarks inside 
and neutrons and they saw that certain particles certain collections of quarks as we now know them had a 
between how fast they were spinning and how heavy they were and someone said veneziano and then susskind later 
say looks like a relationship that you would get if they were little pieces of string that were and 
they developed this idea called string theory and they were frustrated because it kept predicting gravity they want gravity 
their goal and it was people like john schwartz my colleague at cal tech who eventually said gravity exists 
if we get a theory of gravity a good sc everyone laughed no one was really convinced by this 
it until the when schwartz and michael green showed that string theory was actually a mathematically consistent theory that 
started saying okay maybe this is real and not only potentially a theory of quantum gravity but also a 
of everything at the same despite the fact that string theory is by votes the leading theory of quantum 
right now there are many obvious problems with it one is as i think completely onboard with what you 
not really taking the quantum nature of spacetime itself seriously it starts with a string moving through spacetime the 
is there already and you can try to fix that in postproduction as it cr in postproduction sc but 
challenge just as every theory is gonna have its challenges so one challenge another challenge is that when you 
okay what does it say about spacetime that a quantum mechanical string is vibrating in it you find out 
one thing it says is that spacetime is that is not a feature of the real world so you 
okay a known problem that had in other theories we can hide these extra dimensions we can curl them 
so invisible but guess what more than one way to do that probably an infinite number of ways to 
that at least numbers are thrown around ten to the five hundred different ways of doing so your aspiration 
getting a theory that was not only gravity but all the other forces of nature gets mired in this 
this fact that we know how to go from the ur theory in ten dimensions down to the fourdimensional 
world sc so a string theorist would say we have this wonderful thing we have a model where been 
to quantize gravity and here gravity is forced upon us from the rules of quantum mechanics itself we should 
advantage of that of course these issues with ten dimensions and so forth but hopefully those will be whereas 
in loop quantum gravity says i have spacetime i have general relativity i should just take that seriously at 
value try to quantize and there are other problems that come up and you can probably speak to them 
well as i can but then you would also say hopefully those problems will someday be and in a 
where not a lot of direct helpful experimental data because gravity is a weak force and the world looks 
classical to us hard to know which approach is better a priori and we have to invest a little 
of judgment and taste to see which we like better cr yes we have to use intuition judgment as 
say and bet sc yeah cr but i think things are moving things are moving especially with respect to 
last thing you said i agree with everything you said by the way there is perhaps today less a 
that we are moving in a realm completely detached from measurement from experiments not that there are clearcut quantum 
experiments that choose between theories certainly not sc not yet cr not yet but i would say not so 
and a number of things that have happened recently first of all remember that we have experiments that have 
out which are at a scale which is not very different from the quantum gravity scale maybe two or 
orders of magnitude sc right so was this idea from the before we were worrying about quantum gravity it 
a particular take on how to unify all the other forces of nature cr the unification without gravity sc 
gravity so they called it grand unification it that grand also it work like you said the good news 
it made explicit experimental predictions the bad news is we did the experiment the proton should decay into lighter 
positrons and neutrinos and so forth and it been looking for that for a long time cr it it 
an example in which there was a measurement at a scale not so far from the scale of quantum 
but more recently there have been a number of empirical results which tell us something about quantum gravity i 
one which have not touched directly i would say neither string theory nor loop quantum gravity but has touched 
strongly a number of other attempts which that predicted violations of lorentz invariance sc so explain what lorentz invariance 
first laughter cr no you explain what lorentz invariance is sc i can explain what lorentz invariance is you 
again einstein when he was inventing special relativity so he was before putting gravity into the mix he was 
trying to explain the symmetries of very successful electromagnetism and he realized that what you called space what you 
time was in some sense a choice of an observer to split fourdimensional spacetime into the three of space 
the one of time and it matter if you were traveling near the speed of light your clock moves 
with respect to the clock you left behind on earth but either choice was fine nothing that you would 
able to know if you were in a sealed room you know some sort of absolute velocity that you 
with respect to the universe only with respect to some other part of the universe so lorentz invariance lorentz 
is different things moving at different velocities have any way of telling how fast moving in any absolute sense 
with respect to other things cr yes which is what we were saying at the beginning about velocity sc 
right cr a relational notion sc and the fact that it was a relational notion was true even before 
invariance a galilean invariance which is still true for newtonian physics einstein adds this ingredient that the way that 
divide up space and time does depend on your motion through the universe and you can test this idea 
can test it experimentally right cr right and so far it seems to be true sc yes right cr 
spectacularly correct this invariance sc well just just to show how spectacularly correct one of the predictions of lorentz 
is that if something is moving close to the speed of light as we said its internal clock seems 
move at a different rate than a clock that is stationary with respect to us so we see here 
earth raining down from the sky these elementary particles called muons these are part of the standard model of 
physics a muon is basically a heavier version of an electron and you look at how fast moving coming 
these are not created out there in the sky because they decay muons are not forever they decay really 
and in fact they have enough time by our clock to go from the top of the atmosphere where 
in some cosmic ray collision to reach us down here they decayed away how is it possible that they 
the answer is moving so close to the speed of light that their clock is ticking at a different 
and this is kind of a crude but vivid demonstration these days with high precision atomic clocks and other 
of things we can test this ideal lorentz invariance and so far one of the best symmetries that experimentally 
cr right exactly thank you and some attempts to write a quantum theory of gravity others than strings and 
constructed some tentative theories of gravity where lorentz invariance is broken is violated and there was a moment in 
they received a lot of attention these other attempts one was called hořava gravity for instance so the people 
excited maybe we know how to do quantum but then and we could even test it by looking that 
invariance is violated sc sorry an important point to emphasize that scientists get thrilled when they can say that 
some subtle way everything we knew before was wrong right cr yes very good very good i think they 
too thrilled laughter what i think and in fact this is what happened in that case right because a 
of people worked on this idea and a lot of experimenters and astronomers started to look at indications and 
program of observations of astrophysical phenomena that would violate lorentz invariance was launched and this was about ten years 
and i think that now with quite strong evidence that lorentz invariance is not violated at the scale required 
those theories sc right not where you might expect it to be cr so a number of attempts to 
quantum gravity has i say ruled out because ruled out is always a little bit too strong but made 
convincing less credible by the fact that what was predicted was not there so one example in which a 
told something relevant to quantum gravity the second example i have three the second example very recent and with 
waves and in particular the last observation which is two neutron star falling into one another spiraling into one 
and merging that was a few months ago if i remember correctly because that was particular because that was 
by the gravitational wave detectors but also by telescopes radio telescopes all sort of gamma sc so light waves 
well as gravitational waves cr light waves so everybody saw these things which makes observation credible first of all 
see it with a wide variety of instrument it has to be there but the fantastic thing is that 
is a merger of two neutron stars that happened very far away so the light and the gravitational wave 
traveled from there to now for a very long time and they arrived at the same moment within a 
sc as far as we can tell cr as far as we can tell so because of that we 
learned that gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed and in fact if you put the 
they travel at the same speed in one part in ten to the fourteen or so a very great 
before that so one year ago the experimental information the observational information the empirical information on the ratio of 
speed of light to the speed of gravitational wave was one part in so in one single stroke we 
our knowledge of one fundamental parameter of nature by a hundred billion times now why this is so why 
is great because again a lot of people were studying modifications of general relativity that predicted that gravitational waves 
a different give different speed than electromagnetic waves so a lot of work of theoreticians like you and me 
been thrown in the waste basket just in one stroke or again maybe made less credible somehow less interesting 
and the third one and here perhaps touching on a more controversial thing here is the nondiscovery of supersymmetry 
the lhc which was a no news because it was a nondiscovery but i think was the great news 
lhc as important as the discovery of the higgs that made the front page of all the newspapers so 
the lhc the big machine the accelerator of particle turned quite quickly saw the higgs fantastic that was predicted 
the standard model but there was a very large part of the community of theoretical physicists that expected very 
was almost convinced that supersymmetric particle had to come out and be seen sc supersymmetry being this hypothetical symmetry 
says that particles of different spin should have friendly partner particles with different spin but the same exact property 
there should be if an electron which we know and love a supersymmetric partner then called the selectron if 
is a quark there are squarks if there is neutrinos sneutrinos etcetera you should double the number of particles 
supersymmetry is right and like you say many people thought that it was right around the corner we would 
on this machine and squarks and gluinos would come popping out at us and we seen anything yet cr 
have not seen anything yet and string theory requires supersymmetry to work and many people expected that this supersymmetry 
to be visible at the energy of lhc now when it was not seen definitely this does not rule 
string theory at all because string theory could be the supersymmetry could be still there but somehow at a 
energy where we seen it but nevertheless a lot of people were expecting it and i think if it 
been observed i who am not a string guy would have thought these people had the right intuition about 
after all so maybe these people have a point for it prove this to make the theory right but 
would be a plus in their direction sc i think very fair there was no absolute rock hard prediction 
way but had you seen supersymmetry your credence in the string theory would have crept up a little bit 
exactly sc the fact that you see it therefore means it had better go down a little bit cr 
exactly i think this is a point about how to think about science we often say that we propose 
and then they are falsified by an experiment and so if a theory is not falsified it may still 
right but i think things are a little bit more complicated because we put credibility in theory and the 
sort of good indirect things happen the more our credibility goes up and the more things work the credibility 
down so this sc or it should cr yes exactly so science also work this way through hints through 
thing and so what saying is that violation of lorentz symmetry is one the speed of the gravitationalelectromagnetic waves 
another one supersymmetry is another one learning learning things which are all relevant toward quantum gravity and also a 
of attention now in doing toward doing experiments toward quantum gravity sc always cr there is one experiment which 
being proposed which i find very exciting which would not distinguish between quantum gravity theories but would prove that 
is quantized so that gravity is quantized which has been proposed by two independent groups last year or two 
ago and very excited about it so i hope that people would do that soon and so let me 
it you take one particle a sort of nanoparticle small things that people now know how to work with 
you quantum split you put it in a superposition or two positions and you take another particle and you 
quantum split and these two particles both split are next to one another so now there is the gravitational 
between the two so each one is in the newtonian field of the other sc so when we say 
this is not an elementary particle like an electron like a little mote of dust cr a small dust 
small grain of dust right and not we them the people in the laboratories are able to put in 
quantum superposition of two different positions so you have two particles both of them in a superposition next to 
another and so each one of them feels the gravitational force of the two branches in which the other 
is and because of that the state of the two particles gets entangled and now there are very clean 
to see if two things are entangled sc yes cr and if we find that sc and this is 
quantum entanglement cr quantum entanglement this is true quantum entanglement sc not just related but connected at this deep 
mechanical level yeah cr no true quantum deep quantum mechanical level if this happened it means that the gravitational 
itself was in a superposition of two was in two branches so to say and since the gravitational field 
know is spacetime it means that spacetime can be put in a superposition sc and this is a proposed 
it been done yet cr this is a proposed experiment but if you work out the numbers the people 
manipulate these small particles they say that they think they should be able to do it in a few 
and i think it would be wonderful because there are still people around even if in a minority who 
believe that spacetime has quantum sc met them yes cr and because come on spacetime is spacetime a heavy 
and this experiment if it can be done would be splash a clear indication that you can that there 
this indetermination this profound quantum nature also of space itself sc so about halfway through the number of things 
wanted to talk about but we need to go and be good conference participants but let me close i 
two questions that i would like to at least throw out there and the first one be a temptation 
talk about it for half an hour but not loop quantum gravity string theory there are other approaches causal 
theory and euclidean quantum gravity and so forth quantum gravity we have a consensus trying different things but nevertheless 
live in a world where there are finite resources to do science academic positions grant money prizes and so 
glory a feeling certainly been put forward that been unfairness in how the representation of these different approaches to 
gravity has been distributed throughout academia in particular that the string theorists have kind of a dominant position that 
they deserve given that string theory really predicted anything definite that tested sc mathematically very beautiful but obstacles to 
like there are to other theories i personally think that string theory has a good reason to be the 
candidate but i also think that it would be very healthy for the field to be doing various other 
so what are your feelings about the fairness is the free market of ideas working well here or is 
are we not being quite fair enough to this diversity of different approaches cr yes you invite me yes 
think that if i look back a couple of decades the distribution of resources has not been fair with 
me say it clearly with all respect and appreciation for string theory this is far from me for saying 
string theory should not be funded should be thrown out of university or anything like that a wonderful research 
but a research direction not an established result that we can take for granted and as a research direction 
might be right it might be wrong it might be partially right partially wrong and so on and i 
that other approaches the loop quantum gravity in particular has suffered because of the dominance of string theory there 
a nonlinearity a bandwagon effect powerful people are in powerful positions and do one thing and it would not 
the first time in the history of science in which a group of people a large group of people 
and push the field in a direction which is not useful it could be so i think a little 
more fairness and being more free market sc right so to be fair and maybe we alluded to this 
it become clear any approach to quantum gravity or any other unsolved puzzle in physics has this element of 
around it in the sense that you will be making some sacrifices right like some things in a certain 
work and are very nice and natural and other things seem problematic and different people have different judgments as 
say this is a problem but surely we will overcome cr yes sc with a few more years of 
and so string theory clearly has a problem connecting from this purported reality down to our fourdimensional reality do 
wanna mention some of the problems that loop quantum gravity has cr well yes i think that in the 
in which working i work in the covariant version of loop quantum gravity at least there is and this 
a plus a welldefined set of equations okay so right now say this is the theory now we know 
if this is consistent in the precise sense we can use it order by order to to compute but 
know if this converges in any sense so even in the weakest possible sense we know if going to 
the theory go fully sc this is one of those famous things in quantum theories where you might calculate 
good approximation but then you try to make your approximation better and everything blows up cr and everything blows 
right right so since this has not been proved this has not been checked there even good indications for 
so this is definitely a weakness of the theory the theory could blow up still and be meaningless however 
think that what we need is not more mathematics we need to apply this theory to reality working on 
application to black holes a lot of people like me is trying to connect loop quantum gravity to astrophysics 
if it can say something for i know dark matter fast radio bursts gamma ray signals signatures in the 
background radiation because at the end of the day what will convince us that one theory is good or 
is not in my opinion the mathematical cleanness we get it sc no and some day that day might 
a while before it comes but you have to explain the data you have cr you have to explain 
data so in the moment in which we say look i have a prediction or explanation of the data 
it works well then the attention of the community will focus on that let me say about the string 
that things have changed with respect to some time ago i think there have there is much more reciprocal 
than ten years ago and i there was a moment in which string theory had very high hopes and 
sort of saying we had it it has backtracked a little bit from that sc well the hopes were 
high there were hopes for a quick resolution cr right i would say there was a moment in which 
thought okay now gonna compute all the parameters of the standard model now gonna do this and this and 
gonna see supersymmetry and then gonna understand dark matter because dark matter is just a neutralino or whatever all 
will come together and things are more difficult sc nature is subtle and occasionally malicious laughter cr nature is 
so the idea of oh we are there a bit more far away people step back which means also 
is more respect people i talk to string theorists more than before and there is exchange obviously we can 
from one another right because the way physics work sc well and maybe this feeds into the answer to 
final question which is predict the future what do you see coming in the next ten or twenty years 
among those things do you see convergence between different attempts to think about quantum gravity or do you see 
diversity with more things coming or do you think that just gonna get the right answer and everyone will 
cr i know making prediction is always difficult especially about the future cr i know i think that it 
be great to think that there is convergence but in the history of science there have been huge debates 
disagreements not in a particularly special situation right if you look back at the history of science there have 
been very opposite theories phlogiston or is and so on and so many copernicus sc computing model of the 
yes cr right exactly and usually one of the two sides turned out to be right and the other 
out to be wrong and often it took long it took long to get clarity what i hope and 
would like to see that this is going to happen is that i we can compute a black hole 
into a white hole and recognize that some signals are exactly that and then we have a clear grasp 
something which is happening and so we will see that this is a right direction to go sc well 
is out there in the universe quantum mechanics is out there in the universe not completely unrealistic to imagine 
somehow it will show up cr yes i do expect it will show up somehow i have a it 
much closer today than it seemed twenty years ago sc alright a great place to stop carlo thank you 
much for coming by cr thank you sean thanks a lot music living up to my every expectation carlo 
is an outstanding thinker what a great conversation i hope one day if carlo starts a podcast he interviews 
start practicing your italian now sean this was wonderful please have carlo back to chat about the remaining questions 
have for him great podcasts sean thank you you touched on something that is of great interest to me 
symmetry we have had one major energy upgrade at cern and there have been no detections of super symmetric 
yes they could exist at higher energies but what if they show up if super symmetry is dead would 
not mean big problems for the standard model very thank where does rovelli differ from carroll with respect to 
manyworlds interpretation interesting guest thanks but for future episodes wondering if possible to describe in a little more detail 
people like mr rovelli and sean work maybe this is impossible for the readerlistener who do the advanced math 
i can imagine explaining what newton did as noticing that certain physical phenomena could be modeled according to mathematical 
eg fma which can be tested if an accurate description maybe this is impossible for something like string theory 
then talking about it except to other experts is not very useful carlo rovelli holds to rqm interpretation meaning 
mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems and this is a 
description of the reading his book i would clear how strongly he relates to this view even in his 
of arrow the view is of course also somewhat related to his route in loop quantum gravity although remarkable 
his notion of time differs from that of his collaborator lee smolin so refreshing to see how each of 
amazing theorists holds to different notions in so many subjects the beauty of science quick comment you claim that 
have a lot of competition for development of general relativity but it appears that david hilbert was definitely in 
running with only a slight hope that this gives you a conniption i was wondering what you thought of 
paper which peter woit claims falsifies the multiverse since i have no ability to evaluate the claim i was 
what the opinion of a professional was on this it sounds to me like the loops would be waves 
that these waves would be strings so that loop quantum gravity is just a special case of string theory 
have no clue about the maths though so i am probably way off comments are closed sean carroll hosts
