host sean carroll and today going to talk about reality we like to think that almost all episodes of 
talk about reality in one way or another but today gonna dig a little bit more deeply into what 
means for something to be real you know what that means gonna be talking philosophy as well as science 
things you just know are real tables and chairs being classic examples of things you know are real but 
could even question them but other categories where the issue is less clear are morals real is the ability 
make free choices and to have free will real in the world what about numbers what about a perfect 
and other mathematical structures are they real in the same way so guest is james ladyman who is a 
whose work is distinguished by insisting that philosophy metaphysics ontology and so forth had better be informed by our 
current scientific knowledge everyone agrees with this as a sort of cliche but james really tries to make it 
in his philosophy sc and one of the issues that comes up when you try to do that as 
metaphysicist metaphysician they say sorry about that is one of the things about science is that it keeps changing 
idea of what is really real right aristotle had some idea of what reality is newton had a different 
einstein had a different idea schrodinger had yet a different idea how can you hope to have any purchase 
the idea of what is real if the scientific stuff of which the world is made keeps changing as 
understanding improves so james has championed an idea called structural realism that is the patterns the structures that relate 
things in the world that really matter that are real not the actual stuff out of which made maybe 
day understand what that stuff is perfectly but the patterns between different objects remain in good shape even as 
make a transition from newtonian physics to relativity and so forth sc there are very plausibly downtoearth consequences of 
view like this one of the other things that james has been working on is the idea of complexity 
complex structures and whether there is something truly new that comes into being when simple pieces come together to 
something complex this is an issue of obvious philosophical relevance but also very important for computer science for biology 
physics and so forth now be honest this is a mindbending episode no doubt about it so put your 
caps on and go music sc james ladyman welcome to the mindscape podcast james ladyman thank you sean sc 
just in case we get through all of our many topics to discuss i want to start with some 
the big picture questions so an expert on metaphysics and philosophy so tell me what is real jl well 
wanna know what you mean what is meant by real or do you want an examples of real or 
things i think are real that are controversial or what sc so yeah unless you have some wacky ideas 
examples why we give a definition of what it means for something to be real jl in the book 
wrote with don ross called every thing must go we use this idea of dan dennett that to be 
to be a real pattern sc okay jl so that is a putative definition of real and the story 
is something like real is what necessary to talk about if you want to capture information about the world 
in particular capture want to make predictions and explanations so on that kind of view it make any sense 
say real but by the way you predict or explain anything with it sc okay very good jl so 
you take that kind of view tying reality to kind of indispensability in a predicted explanatory scheme the good 
about that way of thinking about things is it gives a unified account of reality between common sense everyday 
and science so for example say the real because i need to talk about it to get by in 
world but i can also say you know the andromeda galaxy is real because i need to talk about 
to systematize the observations i have of the universe now part of the criterion is nonredundancy and information efficiency 
give you an example the reason why good to talk about the table rather than just the parts of 
table is because if i talked about all the parts of the table separately it would take me much 
to say things and to make predictions than if i just talk about the table as a whole but 
reason for that is the table hangs together as a whole sc and talking about it as an object 
a purpose jl talking about it as an object serves a purpose whereas don favorite example or used to 
the compound object of my left earlobe miles last solo the largest elephant in namibia you combine those things 
you get no extra purchase on the world than you have by talking about each of them separately and 
for that reason that count as a bonafide object sc yeah so those are separately real things jl separately 
things but the compound of them is not a real thing sc okay jl whereas the compound of the 
of the table is a real thing because they hang together but roughly speaking i mean but we could 
it artificially we could say something like in order to track the behavior of the world i talk about 
table because i can move the table from here to there and all the parts stay i can do 
kind of dynamics of the table if i was interested in rolling the table across the room or something 
do we worry that this puts too much emphasis on usefulness to us human beings jl right so an 
to this so some people will say just epistemological just talking about what you need to talk about to 
track of things and not the same thing as my view would be yes it is the whole point 
this is to say no but what we mean by real what counts as real is what we need 
talk about to track the phenomena sc in the sense that the notion of reality is a word that 
invented and gonna assign to it meanings that are useful to us jl yeah or you could say or 
could say well just look at uncontentious examples of real and try to generalize and abstract a way a 
abstract a in virtue of why are we calling those things real and the thought is well all the 
examples satisfy this criterion and examples that we wanna count as real like the one i just mentioned of 
compound of the earlobe and the solo and the elephant violate the criteria so doing a reasonable job with 
examples and therefore is useful for contested examples sc right and there people who are little bit more extremist 
this and say that even things like tables and chairs real only the sort of fundamental layer of reality 
real jl right so there are loads of people who you probably know the quote attributed to rutherford i 
science physics and stamp sc yes i know it well a colleague of mine has it on the poster 
their door chuckle jl right so the thought there is something like we wanna distinguish between the stuff which 
we talk about and the really real i could talk for a while about why i think the right 
to go but for the moment just say i understand that view but i disagree with it sc well 
by those standards you just set things like tables and chairs do serve this function and we should definitely 
them real jl yeah i sometimes find that philosophers will i mean a lot of philosophers will say this 
that real is that fundamental level or the ultimate building blocks or and what say to that is something 
this look i am interested in the distinction which we make between unicorns and horses right if you tell 
all really real the fundamental building blocks then just say real right what interested in is the distinction that 
make in everyday life and in science between things that we hypothesized but then decide exist or that people 
exist but we think no evidence for and the things that we do think exist like horses and the 
interested in and the distinction which i think got a good grip on if you talked to me about 
putative fundamental level which nobody has ever found and we have then gonna say not the distinction that marking 
our ordinary talk of reality according to which horses are part of reality and unicorns sc but there go 
on to the more contentious examples numbers are numbers real jl good not gonna fit the real patterns account 
we then have to say okay the real patterns account is an account of concrete empirical reality of something 
as well as numbers you could talk about courage or sc love jl yeah sc not gonna tell me 
is not real james come on chuckle jl you know the three illusions that human life is based on 
sc i know those jl the self free will and love sc a big fan of all of those 
chuckle jl real love no love is real but not real in the same way that the horses are 
guess and what interested in the book is giving an account of real gonna be applicable to the kind 
questions that people discuss in the philosophy of science when they ask atoms how are tables real as well 
atoms so good so the real patterns account is a partial account and if you want to allow the 
of abstract objects then the criterion is gonna have to be modified so say something disjunctive right you could 
say the real patterns account just is real full stop and all this other stuff is not or you 
say the real patterns account is a good account of empirical reality and we have to say something different 
abstract stuff now my own view about numbers is that something misleading about saying that the number two is 
and also something misleading about saying the number two is not real sc i completely agree with that laughter 
yeah i get it yeah so you mentioned by the way the book you mean the book everything must 
with you and don ross jl yeah sc right and so i can imagine in the real patterns account 
some sense the number five or the concept of love do denote real patterns they they do explanatory work 
if i say i have five apples people know what that means a meaningful statement jl right sc but 
think i agree with what saying is that the number five exist in the same sense that a table 
it have this physical reality jl right i mean sc is that a meaningful distinction jl yeah definitely the 
of mathematical objects is something that thought about for a very long time very close to my heart and 
know what the right view is sc okay jl one thing i do think less misleading to say something 
is reality to now why is that less misleading i would say because what that conveys is something like 
thought that mathematics is objective and mind independent or something right sc right jl that we just we just 
it up and that is my view about mathematics but there are lots of people who know a lot 
mathematics who disagree with that sc yeah jl i was just talking about this with someone the other evening 
be saying know really interesting because i sometimes think well my kind of belief that mathematics is an objective 
that we discover rather than invent is to do with the fact that i went to university to do 
maths and maths was my kind of first intellectual but then there are people who are much more mathematicians 
i am who would say just a formal system i make up some rules and then i see what 
of the very interesting things about mathematics is that within the mathematical community the platonism is platonism by which 
mean the view that maths has an independent reality or something is not the dominant view of mathematicians and 
interesting i mean there are these people who devote their lives to studying this subject matter and are quite 
with the idea that all invented or that there a reality to it as opposed to just the playing 
of inferences based on it rules i mean what people will sometimes call ifthenism is a kinda crude version 
this view you just say what follows sc i think that makes sense to me it might be a 
version but i yeah a set of conditional statements right jl right but then the thing that people always 
in reply to that is there seem to be this sense in which mathematics is built into the world 
this close connection between the discourse of abstractions and application and this is a very difficult issue sc yeah 
sc but wait i think i quite get where coming so i get that for mathematical objects a little 
open you can see the force of arguments on either side and where did you come down about love 
courage being real accepting that this is us deciding how to decide define the terms rather than us learning 
things about the universe jl come down on love and courage being real when people ask real they often 
what are the objects and philosophers would say something like order or you well love an object but properties 
be real too and i think talking about characteristics like that seems to be indispensable in understanding human beings 
so then where does that bring you down on free will being real or not jl free will now 
a difficult one because i never really know meant by that i always say to my students will is 
supposed to be problematized by sc right jl and then people say and you get all these people saying 
like yeah so because we have quantum mechanics we can have free will or something right and then i 
we all believe nonsense jl right because then i think alright okay then yeah my actions are the result 
some stochastic event right that make me free i want my actions to be caused sc yeah jl i 
want them to be caused by my deliberations right so i suppose my view on free will is and 
is something no way an expert on thought nearly enough about and this is really impressionistic but i think 
my views might be quite close to humian kind of compatiblism that i think the right thing to say 
something like free when i can tell a plausible story about why i did what i did in terms 
my deliberations and i need that to be something outside the causal structure of reality i mean if you 
tell me some facts about how my deliberations are the result of in the end the physical goings on 
my brain i mind i mean as long as the right thing to say is that i did it 
i decided to rather than someone held a gun to my head then it would seem like i was 
but i hear that really difficult but again i think there is so many levels of freedom so i 
choose but i have a habit is that free i freely choose but i decide very quickly and clicking 
something on a web page outrageous that fullblown freedom i think so maybe the right thing to say about 
will is not an allnothing thing that there are degrees jl so in this book with don ross everything 
go you defend a view called structural realism so this is a particular point of view on what counts 
real right how would you tell us what structural realism is jl well structural realism is started out as 
view about scientific theories and the reality of the positive scientific theories in the light of the fact that 
change and had very good theories which we now think are not true and we will think that not 
in our current theories is true and so what we wanna do is have a sensible form of realism 
science by sensible meaning a view compatible with the fact of theory change and the fact that sometimes theory 
can be quite radical in respect of the fundamental claims that are made jl so for example newtonian physics 
absolute time we think absolute time it says that that mass is an intrinsic property of objects we think 
is it says that instantaneous action at a distance due to gravity we think there is and yet i 
say a kind of reality to newtonian forces and you know of course the great thing about newtonian gravitation 
it made novel predictions so if we think that novel prediction is the reason why we commit ourselves to 
scientific theories say exist we have to realize that that they can make those predictions whilst not being correct 
now the point of structural realism is not to say a distinction between structure and nature and we should 
the structure and not the nature just to say when you look at those cases where abandoned theories what 
find is that much easier to see the continuity with our current theories at the mathematical or structural level 
it is at the level of the fundamental claims those theories make about reality and so sc so what 
is might differ from theory to theory but something that is maintained jl i would say something yeah maintained 
the real patterns at some level of approximation so we were hearing all about dark matter and the thing 
dark matter is needed for is for compatibility with the emergent correctness of law of gravitation right so even 
the light of general relativity we still think that law is a low energy limit a real pattern for 
practical purposes within a domain up to some degree of accuracy so i guess the idea of structural realism 
the most basic level is to say look if you loosen up a bit about about reality you can 
how our theories can be getting things right without getting everything and the way i put it is in 
of the capturing the causal structure of the world that the lawlike structure the i would say the modal 
of the world but not a word that many people use sc how would you define it jl relations 
necessity and possibility between events sc so what is necessary what is possible what is not possible sc what 
necessary what is possible and what follows and newtonian mechanics is gonna be just as good at predicting the 
of comets as it was in the and centuries sc yeah jl does that help sc yeah no well 
helps but it leaves me with this question because i get the usefulness or the attractiveness of structural realism 
help us maintain belief that older theories that have since been superseded nevertheless captured some aspect of reality and 
structures that it were being captured but is it just the structures is that really all there is to 
the relations between different things or is there something or set of things even if we know what that 
is that we would label as real things jl right you see if you take the real patterns view 
things are kind of ways of describing the structure and if there are no patterns no point in talking 
the thing so kind of like the pattern is primary the thing is the way of identifying the pattern 
way of just talking about it one of the thoughts of structural realism is that we have this object 
way of thinking but our physical theories are not just our physical theories now many theories theories in economics 
in mathematical biology really easily translatable into object property talk and one of the thoughts behind structural realism is 
at least the way i think about structural realism and i think don does and i think david wallace 
this way is kind of mathematical representation is primary and we expect that we can translate our best theories 
residue out of that mathematical representation sc would we go so it seems like talking about relations but are 
to say that there exists the things that are being related by these relations you see where my issue 
in jl yeah i suppose i think you talk about relations without talking about things that are related a 
of logical point but whenever you talk about any actual cases we have of things we find that when 
investigate them a bit further they are collections of relations among other things right sc relations all the way 
jl well at least maybe sc maybe jl and if maybe then assume not sc yeah okay motley possible 
epistemically possible yeah for all we know i guess what we come up against a lot in science and 
is that there are sort of unknown limits of our cognition and the way we conceptualize the world to 
extent are our theories based on how the world is and to what extent are they based on how 
have to think about things that probably like the kind i if right to say this but i would 
my neck out and say that maybe the basic insight we get from kant is that the possibility that 
way that we conceptualize things conditions our representations and that plays a role to some extent as well as 
things are how the world is jl so we escape our own cognition and say suppose i this contingent 
that has evolved this limited way of thinking about things how would i think well i just i am 
contingent being who has these ways of thinking sc not a meaningful counterfactual sc no but it is worth 
given that reached the level of sophistication we have we can now see that maybe we are in that 
maybe our cognition apt to describe the fundamental nature of reality as it is in itself or something and 
i think a degree of kind of hedging and agnosticism is appropriate here sc yeah okay and this whole 
this area in which these conversations take place is metaphysics right jl yeah philosophy sc how we label it 
philosophy of science but i think the conversations take place within science itself sc okay well in fact what 
was going to lean in toward because in your book you sort of talk about scientific metaphysics jl yeah 
our the subtitle of our book is metaphysics naturalized sc right and you give a hard time the conventional 
we call analytic metaphysics jl yeah which is which is a fairly recent phenomenon in the way that currently 
i guess sc can you just for background purposes explain a little bit the way currently done and what 
against jl yeah so what we react against is two things at least one is a priori kind of 
philosophy approaches that say need to know about science just think about the fundamental nature of reality using from 
armchair without scientific for example you get debates in metaphysics about what would in virtue of what does some 
form a whole now i would say it depends what talking about in virtue of what do cells form 
well the specific nature of the interactions and relationships between them that generic knowable a priori in virtue of 
sc if you have never have met an organism or a cell you would not be able to say 
cells form an organism jl right and if you know physics you say in virtue of what the atoms 
the table right sc right jl there are specific to those things how they interact one of the themes 
is we point out that in science composition is dynamical not a static thing right so a kind of 
that i have all these parts and then they are a whole for some reason or other whereas in 
i know these parts are a whole because of how interacting often what we talk about is interactions that 
taking place in a very short time and length scales relative to the scale interested in and so it 
seem like there are just these parts but the table is a dynamical entity right yeah so an example 
kind of the way you can get into thinking about reality if you pay attention to science you just 
a priori another thing that we object to is the imposing of the manifest image on the scientific image 
for example a kind of view of building blocks or little particles bumping into each other which we would 
as just completely outdated in the light of physics another thing sc because of quantum mechanics and quantum field 
jl because of quantum mechanics and even before that with field theory or whatever but we call that the 
of science so we say that one thing is ignore science completely another thing is take science and then 
it so it fits your commonsense way of thinking about things and then kind of pretend that talking about 
scientific objects but not really because not talking about them as they are sc right jl i we have 
positive conception of metaphysics which is one that i think scientists engage in whether or not they would call 
metaphysics so this is why i think this is just a philosophical game or activity i think people do 
all the time so for example you wrote a book about it right what can we say about the 
of reality in the light of our knowledge of physics how does reality at the macroscopic level relate to 
microscopic level how does biology relate to chemistry relate to physics what we say is naturalized metaphysics is the 
to say something about the world as a whole in the light of all the science that we have 
another way of putting that is to say something like naturalized metaphysics is about saying how science as a 
hangs together about the unification of science i guess sc so it see it sounds like arguing that metaphysics 
be prior to science because until learned things about how the world works we have no hope of just 
priori coming up with these relations but it still adds something to science it talks about things that cross 
disciplines or transcend them jl right and i think the ultimate test is it needs to contribute actually and 
may be unrealistic and ridiculously ambitious but i think when we wrote our book we were saying this should 
help scientists who are interested in how the world is and it should play some kind of role and 
it we should stop talking about but we set a time limit on that sc okay very clever of 
laughter jl but you often get scientists actually making metaphysical claims so i give an example sir paul nurse 
was the president of the royal society came and gave a talk in bristol he talked about the five 
important ideas in biology and one of them he said was biological processes are physicalchemical processes his example was 
discovery that the fermentation of yeast is oxidation that this is a way of unifying biology with chemistry a 
of understanding biological processes as no special added ingredient no extra mystery just a very complicated emergent phenomenon that 
ultimately resulting from chemical physical processes now a metaphysical claim sc yeah jl but he come to give a 
talk he came to tell everyone about biology and he would regard that as a biological discovery i would 
this is not really not a tool but my david papineau i guess was the person who i learned 
from chronicled how physicalism is a view about the mind and more generally was a contingent empirical discovery there 
no reason to think it had to be true a priori so in the century people wondered there special 
forces are there special chemical sc right jl right now nothing crazy about that i mean a priori maybe 
just turned out that there was no need to posit such things we now understand chemistry in terms of 
electromagnetism so if wanting to do justice to been learned in the history of science then you need to 
learned this metaphysical thing which is about the relationship between chemistry and and that is all by way of 
why not true that metaphysics is this other thing compared to science it is sort of connected to first 
scientific practice not scientific practice lots of scientists have to care about these issues at all but every now 
again really crucial and some scientists think about them a lot and separate thinking about them from being scientists 
so i was very interested at a poster session last night here for those of you in podcast land 
a meeting of the philosophy of science association and there is a poster by a guy who had surveyed 
of science among other things on the question of what was the biggest challenge what was the biggest flaw 
their field right now and there were two big things that people held out as big flaws one was 
enough engagement with science and one was not enough engagement with philosophy apparently because they thought that as philosophers 
science they were isolated within their philosophy departments so how do you think i mean i think you just 
a little bit about how you think the relationship should go how do you think the relationship between philosophy 
science and philosophy of science does go right now in practice and then do you see it changing jl 
good question how it is for me is that i spend more time engaging with scientists i think than 
do philosophers and sc there you go jl i brought up that philosophers who philosophers of science and so 
would say in my field as well i mean i think in philosophy of physics which is the main 
that i work on as well as kind of general philosophy of science the engagement is very close and 
think very healthy i see it is probably going in the right direction as well i think that more 
more physicists are realizing that philosophists of physics know what talking about and not doing kind of not thinking 
physics from a distance a lot of the young people are exceptionally good and really knowledgeable about the physics 
mean some of them have got two phds not that unusual that they have a phd in physics and 
phd in philosophy sc right jl i think intellectual standards and the level of engagement is very high now 
course one still finds the odd physicists who thinks that philosophers are idiots who know anything about physics but 
my own institution written papers with physicists i teach in the physics department as well as in the philosophy 
i have very good relations we have a lots of joint honors students so really the interaction is strong 
i think that unusual in that respect sc do you think a change over the recent years are the 
coming down or were they just less high than i thought jl i think the barrier has come down 
bit i mean i think when i was learning my subject it was true then that the philosophers of 
people like michael redhead and jeremy butterfield and nancy cartwright were very knowledgeable about physics sc right jl and 
think you can look back now on some of their work in the foundations of quantum mechanics and say 
was absolutely topnotch by standards so i guess lucky that i absorbed that culture early on i think that 
mean the point about how philosophy of science relates to the rest of philosophy it depends what part of 
talking about i mean i go to seminars in my department on asset ethics and aesthetics and interested in 
philosophy but where less keen on the pure philosophy is where i think science bears on it but people 
doing it in ignorance of science and in those kinds of areas sympathetic to this quote that we have 
our book from the philosopher quine who said of science is philosophy sc oh i had not heard that 
chuckle i must have missed it jl i think what he was i mean i think so for example 
you take epistemology epistemology is about knowledge about justification well in philosophy of science we have people who study 
and confirmation theory and statistical methods of inference and so on and you know i think really the idea 
doing epistemology and not engaging with that kind of work is a bit odd and likewise with philosophy of 
i think come on gotta look at cognitive science why would sc sure jl why would you wanna do 
of mind without knowing about the science of the mind sc how the mind works yeah jl and if 
think about the history of philosophy i many of the great philosophers were also great scientists some of them 
more time doing science than they did philosophy i mean aristotle would be an example so i think if 
reincarnated aristotle or kant or descartes or leibniz they would they the last things on their reading list would 
pure philosophy right or they would be wanting to catch up with the scientific knowledge which has developed in 
last hundreds of years since they were alive that they would be super excited sc right i thought that 
of science and this is not quite what quine said but related that philosophy of science should be or 
be a paradigm for the rest of the philosophy in the sense that if any one thing that we 
be able to understand at this fundamental level science jl right sc like science is in some sense so 
easier than aesthetics or ethics right if we get physics figured jl well why i often say that ethics 
much too hard for me much rather try and learn quantum field theory than that chuckle but funny when 
talk about science as if it was this thing right whereas kind of everything right i mean what is 
well that includes anthropology and it includes economics and includes biology and it includes cosmology the study of the 
sc right jl right now philosophy well the attempt to understand the world it so how could you really 
do philosophy of science i mean what it really make much sense to me sc well good all on 
same side then chuckle sc speaking of which though to shift topics a little bit but i think there 
continuity here you have a book in preparation on complex systems which might be an area of science and 
but also many other sciences are related to it which is growing in popularity but perhaps underphilosophized is that 
to say jl yeah lucky for me underphilosophized because karoline wiesner with whom written this book and i wrote 
paper a few years ago called is a complex and it came out in two thousand thirteen and got 
lot of citations and i think part of the reason is because just that many papers on that topic 
like to sc like to think jl like to think because such a brilliant paper but i think at 
part of the explanation is that people are crying out for papers like that because they wanna think about 
and complex systems and understand it yeah that is an area that has been looked at by plenty of 
philosophers of science other than myself though so lots of other work out there one can think of early 
in philosophy of science by herbert simon way back on complex systems more recent work by people like bill 
and michael strevens and other people have worked on it but a great area because the area of science 
guess giving us most understanding of emergence and emergence is precisely the name for whatever goes on when we 
biology as well as chemistry as well as physics so exactly what the topic we were talking about how 
science as a whole relate how do we get higher level structure out of the basics sc i like 
definition of emergence i never heard that one before the thing that you need to explain a world where 
get biology and chemistry as well as physics jl yeah sc a contentious word right weak emergence and strong 
jl oh the problem with the philosophical lecture on the topic is that probably not a month goes by 
somebody come up with the new taxonomy of different kinds of emergence sc right when i wrote the big 
i was warned by some philosophers but even more sociologists call it emergence it means in some subfield exactly 
opposite of what you wanted to a form of emergence that i like and try to promulgate where you 
some microscopic understanding but then there are ways of looking at the system from afar where you see a 
kind of behavior that you might not have noticed but still implied by the microscopic behavior and then this 
different notion of emergence where the microscopic behavior just entail the macroscopic behavior and certainly stronger than that jl 
right so some conceptions of emergence some extra magic ingredient that appears or something i know how to make 
of that the way that thought about emergence since working on complex systems is exemplified i guess by how 
colonies work no overall controller but incredible emergence in the sense that the ants can build bridges and not 
that they can decide whether more efficient to build a bridge or go the long way round right sc 
jl they consider if we go the long way round gonna tie up the ants who are traveling but 
we build a bridge gonna tie up ants in being part of the bridge and gonna be a tradeoff 
they optimize pretty well sc and yet no single ant is asking itself these questions jl no of course 
i say the ants no ant is asking itself that question so the interesting thing is how does this 
then and the answer is it arises through interaction and feedback between individual ants and the thing got to 
if you want to understand emergence and this of course goes back to anderson and more is different the 
of interactions among the parts of a system in giving rise the behavior of a and feedback i more 
more i think now feedback is key and in the case of human beings i think we really wanna 
hard about the feedback between ourselves and the technology that made in the form of smartphones say where you 
and think ten years ago people do everything on smartphones right now they kind of do why is that 
basically sc and so potentially new kinds of emerging behavior might be emerging jl right which seeing yeah and 
know feedback is the basis of our cognition anyway right because the way that we become conscious selfconscious normal 
minds is by interacting with each other if you have a human being who interact with any other human 
then they will not be able to learn language they have many of the aspects which we say are 
to human beings so what that means is that essential to our natures that we develop in interaction and 
worries me quite a lot is so gonna happen if that interaction is with technology gonna happen if that 
is with an ai system or sc then we become something different you mean jl yeah sc yeah and 
is this providing a partial or complete answer to the question raised by the title of your new book 
is a complex system is it all about feedback and emergence from constituent parts jl yeah so what we 
really you know sometimes the right answer terribly exciting and the kind of boring answer right and i think 
often true the right answer is there are different kinds of complex system and they have different features not 
of them have all the sc what are your favorite features that make up a complex system jl nested 
robustness of behavioral structure modularity so that means something like the division of labor division of function and also 
new kinds of invariants and universality that come about when you modeled systems as networks or you model them 
information processing systems sc so is jl those are some of the examples sc is the aspiration that this 
be a useful contribution of scientific metaphysics because noticing regularities or universalities between very different kinds of systems jl 
and the book is not a book primarily for philosophers i wrote it with karoline wiesner as i said 
mathematician we started working together when bristol opened the center for complexity sciences i had a graduate program and 
wanted to have a component in that program that just asked the question is the graduates were a heterogeneous 
some of them were working on cells some of them were working on the economy some of them were 
on social structures or one kind another ants and all sorts of things and right from the beginning we 
asking the question is complexity is there a single thing is one kind of cynical view is something like 
such thing as complexity just a buzzword that people use to get because for a period it really was 
very big buzzword as sure you know sc yeah yeah chuckle jl and the view that ended up taking 
a kind of middle view yeah there is a kind of distinctive phenomena here but there a single thing 
complexity and one of the things we do in the book is we discuss the different measures of complexity 
have been proposed in the literature of which there were many sc i proposed one jl okay chuckle sc 
in your book sure jl it might maybe not no but what we say basically is that each of 
measures is measuring a feature of a complex system and not measuring complexities per se let me give you 
example some of the measures clearly what they really measure is order of one kind or another right sc 
jl now order could have been produced by a central controller and not what we associate with complex systems 
measure itself tell you whether the order that got where it came from it just tells you how much 
there is so for example you can imagine a string of digits you can calculate the order what kind 
correlations are there are and at what length scales in that string for example but it tell you where 
string came from but if you know that that came from a complex system then a kind of proxy 
for the complexity of that system but not measuring complexity as such measuring order produced by a complex system 
so what definition of complexity is this does this have a name i know that jim crutchfield for example 
to always stop people when they measure complexity and says measure of complexity are you jl right so what 
is each of the measures of complexity is measuring a feature of complex systems and why there are lots 
different measures so you have to choose because if what measuring is something like how cliquey is the network 
example you may wanna measure that in terms of the kind of average connectivity of nodes or something or 
degree of clustering of nodes or whatever there are there are good useful measures of such things but if 
were studying a different aspect of a complex system be using a different measure so you might for example 
a measure of the robustness of the system so what saying is there are different features that complex systems 
and there are measures of those features no one true measure of complexity sc and are there or should 
hope to find laws of complex systems like we find laws of thermodynamics or arguably even in biology jl 
think you get things like power laws that turn up in different places and you can associate those with 
but i think gonna have something like a law of all complex systems no i think that make a 
of sense i think sc well we our symposium that brought us here we talked about the notion of 
which is sort of on the opposite side of complexity in some sense maybe and you brought up an 
issue that in some sense we talk about the standard model of particle physics as being very fundamental it 
about elementary particles and so forth but in a very different sense we talk about darwinian evolution natural selection 
also fundamental but the words fundamental clearly means something very very different in those two cases one means that 
microscopically describes everything around us the other is it would still hold true if the microscopic description of everything 
us was utterly different so some robustness that extends across possible worlds we could live in so i guess 
getting at for the complex systems could there be darwinlike behavior that you say you have a system satisfying 
criteria we can have certain expectations about how it might jl good in answer to that i would say 
there could be so for example that might i guess you could well some of the laws in biology 
the price equation or something are just that right emergent laws that apply to complex living systems so yes 
could be in that sense yes there could be but i i say apply to all complex systems because 
our kind of quite liberal sc yeah a lot of things jl a condensed matter system is a complex 
and so too is the internet and so too is the economy sc good and so learned also last 
that finishing up another book this one on materialism is that right jl with robin brown yeah sc and 
is materialism in the sense of the world is made of matter or not of supernatural forces not about 
and you wanna go shopping you like jl right yeah lots of philosophers would call it physicalism these days 
we talk about materialism just we think that the kind of reader that we want to engage with the 
know what we mean if we say physicalism i think for your sc whereas they would think they know 
you mean if you said materialism chuckle jl right well they might think interested in materialism and then they 
wanna know more about it whereas if you say physicalism they might just think i mean for your listeners 
clarify physicalism is just what we say in the light of the fact that the kind of classical early 
conception of matter is not really apt for contemporary physics but one of the things that robin and i 
about in a paper from some years ago was that a kind of negative side to materialism and a 
side to materialism and the positive side is some claim about there is is the or somehow is ultimately 
emerges from the or lots of different versions of it but the negative side is in no supernatural stuff 
guess and what interested in doing is chronicling the history of those ideas and also the way that materialists 
been slandered and persecuted i guess chuckle jl and often people will say things like well if a materialist 
you must have no yeah as you said a materialist then you must only be motivated to pursue base 
something and obviously not correct and actually one of the things that written about elsewhere is that people often 
scientism is this terrible view that takes away all the magic from human beings and therefore somehow it is 
associated with not caring about and i just point out that if you look at the history you find 
the more that naturalized our understanding of human beings the more been inclined to treat people humanely jl so 
example if i know anything about medicine i might think that my elderly relative has suddenly become a horrible 
but when i understand dementia then i mean no necessary connection but just actually correlates with treating the person 
humanely because you realize got a degenerative brain disease not their fault that now being really grumpy and angry 
another example might be autistic children where an oldfashioned view would be something like this kid is clearly just 
crazy and a more humane view is this child is developing differently from how some other children actually i 
not normal because part of the normal spectrum of human behaviors and they have lots of different kind of 
among human beings and normal that some people are on the autistic spectrum but if got someone a young 
who is quite extreme on the autistic spectrum they may produce behavior which you otherwise would just think just 
horrible kid jl once you understand that autistic you say this child is having difficulty understanding going on we 
to communicate with them in special ways and when we do that able to help them develop and be 
and interact with them better and so so you could take other examples schizophrenia not possessed by the devil 
right sc yeah jl so i think that the kind of materialistic naturalistic way of understanding human beings actually 
with more humane treatments of what we might call a typical human psychology and behavior sc i think this 
a fascinating claim and partly because on the one hand inclined to agree and my anecdotal experience aligns up 
this that in some sense for example in situations where people are dying found that atheists and naturalists tend 
deal with it better than religious people sometimes but on the other hand i also recognize i have a 
cognitive bias in this particular area what i think and i wanna think that people like me are better 
to handle these things so be interesting to study in some rigorous quantitative way whether the connection between materialism 
physicalism or naturalism and humane treatment about the human beings is in fact causal and a real connection or 
a coincidence jl yeah not making that strong a claim i think that just making the weaker claim that 
necessary connection whatsoever between a kind of naturalistic view of human beings and a cold clinical attitude to human 
sc yeah jl right really the point not making the claim that naturalists are nicer people than religious people 
fact a lot of evidence that prosocial behavior correlates strongly with sc true jl religious belief lots of the 
we often maybe those of us who religious may forget that actually a lot of the really important charity 
done in this world is done by people with very strong religious commitment and i respect religious faith and 
think that people who believe in god idiots or irrational or anything but just saying that wrong to think 
if a naturalist or a materialist that means that you think that human life matter or that you are 
to somehow be cold and disregarding of human beings sc and is your book mostly about the intellectual history 
materialism you said you were doing a lot of work on how people with these views were treated and 
forth jl right so yeah a bit historical and a bit about what would a viable contemporary form of 
look like sc and do you felt myself and again but i know that i have a bias so 
to be careful on the one hand the fraction of people who are atheists naturalists materialists physicalists seems to 
increasing with time but our popular social discourse caught up in some way right we still treat atheists as 
little scary on tv or something like that jl yeah you could look at it this way if you 
in anything supernatural then that means each of us have got this life and nothing else and that makes 
more important right if potentially got the afterlife then not such a big deal if it go well for 
here right but if this is it and not talk about me talk about some child born in poverty 
destitution right that if you think that kid has only got this one life then it matters a hell 
a lot that their life options are so curtailed and their life is full of so much suffering and 
of opportunity you know if you tell yourself yeah but worry because virtuous god will make up for it 
might you might be less motivated to do something about it now you might not be but you might 
sc well to slightly misuse a phrase you are preaching to the converted on this one very much in 
all right james ladyman thanks so much for being on the podcast jl thanks it was my pleasure thank 
very much music are real things only those which can be described communicated what if we are dealing with 
apparently delusional person who denies the existence of said chair is it real nonetheless their objections to it i 
to take a maximalist view of these things all logically consistent propositions are though not necessarily true comporting with 
reality the more people subscribe to a set of said propositions the more it becomes so that we can 
of apparently abstract entities like cultures as if they are independent of the minds that adhere to them strong 
but a monism in that all this arises from underlying physical phenomena this would then account for those who 
be cognitively different that the norm may not subscribe to a scientific worldview etc is materialism sufficient to account 
our inner consciousness and self awareness which is expressed outwardly through words human complex biological systems consist exclusively of 
elements mostly arranged around carbon yet carbon speaks the answer to this mystery may be a prerequisite to eventually 
what is real in this world without it we may be fumbling around in a dark room for a 
long time the definition of in the dictionary is quite complex are we not in some sense arguing about 
that definition comprehends when allowed to apply the word and not whether mathematical objects quantum fields and tables share 
essential feature that puts them all into that definition overall great content still some areas you could have probed 
deeply what is a pattern and what what is a concept what is the ontological status and role of 
can new concepts representations instantiate real things why the primacy of language why think that refers to one internally 
set of objects as opposed to a union of several sets whose objects are real in different ways why 
on in the first place instead of just the relations of different types of reality ie some kind of 
mishmash per schaffer aristotle this make reality rather parochial and limited what reality would totally inhuman consciousness have multiple 
ethics please generally the return to pragmatism what happens to model epistemology now sc relations all the way down 
is the concept of reality in buddhist philosophy also called dependent origination the in buddhism means that objects themselves 
substance just like father and son exist independently buddhist philosophy take this to extreme everything exists like this this 
one of the few discussions with a philosopher enjoyed how sensible he was one small note of disappointment though 
when he said something like that he had no problem with religious people that is kind of an odd 
for someone interested in real and it reflects the common but wrong idea that a religion is their own 
people vote have too many children make based on bugus religious beliefs and it screws things up for everyone
