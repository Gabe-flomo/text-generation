to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast i am your host sean carroll 
if like me you remember maybe in high school maybe in college in some psychology course being taught about 
hierarchy of needs there was this pyramid diagram and at the bottom of it there were your basic physiological 
food shelter things like that then you built up through other higher level psychological needs until at the top 
reach selfactualization so guest scott barry kaufman is a psychologist who is proposing that we update hierarchy of needs 
two things sc number one actually dug into many of the writings that maslow himself did and learned things 
maslow himself never drew a pyramid and maslow himself had a lot of ideas that go well beyond the 
hierarchy of needs and the second thing that scott does is propose an entirely new metaphor based on a 
kind of hierarchy he thinks that the pyramid metaphor is a little bit stationary and it gives you the 
that just something to achieve that would make us once and for all selfactualized sc idea is that instead 
we should aim for is not selfactualization but transcendence and the metaphor he uses for this is not a 
but a sailboat the hull of the boat which has some of your more basic needs and then the 
of the sailboat which have more dynamic needs and i like this imagery because as a physicist as someone 
knows about entropy and the arrow of time in the big picture and elsewhere absolutely emphasized that we should 
of life as a process as a series of changes inevitable changes things like happiness which are very popular 
a little bit overrated because we get the idea that you can just achieve happiness and stay there and 
is not like that sc scott and i talk about different ways of being psychologically healthy the different needs 
identified the empirical research that used to identify these needs and i push back a little bit because i 
with everything he says but you know what psychology not anywhere near done not a mature field in the 
that particle physics or cosmology are that gives us a little bit of a way to think about ways 
we could do better in understanding who we as human beings really are how we can live our best 
sc i should also mention that scott has his own podcast called the psychology podcast he was lucky enough 
get that name early on where you can find him talking to a bunch of professional psychologists about these 
and a whole bunch of related ideas sc remember you can support the mindscape podcast on patreon if you

scott barry kaufman welcome to the mindscape podcast scott barry kaufman thanks sean been looking forward to this chat 
a while sc you know i thought while thinking about this chat that in some ways psychology is as 
as physics and cosmology physics and cosmology tries to understand the whole universe which is very big but psychology 
to understand people which are very complicated laughter sc the idea of writing a book that actually gives useful 
to people living their lives and how they think and things like that a daunting task so before we 
get into the details what are your thoughts about the hubris of being a psychologist and trying to help 
with psychology sk okay sure i think in a lot of ways one could make the argument that studying 
is more complicated than studying the universe sc oh yeah no i get it more complicated no doubt sk 
me elaborate i those are fighting words perhaps for physicists but i think in some ways humans are more 
we get the sun you get the sun okay the sun rotates yeah fine okay no joking but we 
how the universe works in some ways and a certain predictability or regularity there right but my gosh studying 
is so confusing because sk first of all individual differences and as you know the area that i focus 
mostly fascinated with human variation and when you start looking into individual differences then like all bets are off 
a sense some psychologists focus just in the universals and that may give us a false sense of predictability 
humans but then you say what if we look at the then you realize my gosh these general principles 
break down because you have this ahole who broke all the laughter you know what i mean sc they 
exist sk with the universe you have that many aholes who get out of line when you have the 
beautiful when you come up with a beautiful equation am i right sc yeah this is why not fighting 
at all i think that physicists and cosmologists be the first to agree that studying human beings is way 
complicated the beauty of physics is that it actually is at heart super simple and elegant and pristine but 
we totally agree that human beings are complicated and hard what gives you how do you get through the 
telling yourself nevertheless i have really good insights to share with you sk yeah especially with all these replication 
happening and the fact that a lot of things coming out well i think a spirit and excitement of 
me share with you what we discovered but i think that you have to have that humility as a 
to not say we found it once and for all in any sort of lane and to not have 
confidence that people change as well sk you see a lot of research on what is and i think 
dearth of research in psychology on what could be there are people that try to do interventions and a 
of interventions work but you do see this tendency especially in the intelligence field for instance been no good 
gonna say this right now been no really strong intervention that has dramatically improved iq scores and intelligence sk 
bunch of intelligence researchers who almost get a glee from that finding which i understand why a glee for 
but almost a sense of like we told you none of that change but that pretty geneticallydetermined or influenced 
heavily and yet i still wanna maintain the spirit of interesting well just keep not like we just stop 
to do interventions just because we been able to find the one that really had a striking effect sc 
in sort of the engineering and technology side of psychology as well as the science descriptive side of psychology 
yeah i think equally which makes me weird and not only weird but it makes me have a fight 
civil war within myself because i that was a phrase maslow used in terms of trying to become integrated 
beings sc oh sk we need to transcend that civil war within ourselves these different sides of ourself that 
fighting each other but i have the scientist hat and when that hat is on in full force it 
not really like the intervention hat side of myself and when the intervention side of myself is on like 
really into the scientist that it is an interesting sort of balance that i try to strike within myself 
well you mentioned maslow tell us about maslow cause gonna go into your new book that is coming out 
transcendence is that right sk called transcend sc transcend sk a verb sc got it transcend is it like 
order giving people chuckle or are you telling them in imperative sk yes yes the idea an action action 
for sure hopefully an inspirational north star kind of book that kind of shows what humans could be sc 
and it builds on the work of abraham maslow tell us a little bit about who he is all 
of him but fill us in as if we know sk oh good really glad you said that had 
people be like one knows who maslow is why should anyone care about your like laughter appreciate i like 
attitude about that everyone knows who maslow is well i think most people taken an introductory psychology class who 
taken an introductory management class have come across writings sc yeah sk for sure come at least if never 
heard of maslow have come across that iconic pyramid now so abraham maslow was a humanistic sc sorry the 
is the hierarchy of needs that talking about sk correct hierarchy of needs and usually depicted as a pyramid 
you have an order of needs that must be met before one can become everything capable of becoming which 
labeled selfactualization now this is the story being told to so many introductory psychology management students and people who 
it diagrammed on the internet however it turns out that maslow never drew a pyramid chuckle and there are 
many misconceptions about the hierarchy of needs incorrect how been taught the past sixty years chuckle been incorrect sc 
had a list of needs a hierarchy but he just never drew them in the form of a pyramid 
correct he never conceptualized in that way his theory was very developmental he made it very clear that we 
constantly in this dynamic of moving two steps forward and one step back that we can target multiple needs 
we have to wait to start selfactualizing until everything else is done until we check all the boxes and 
as i like to say in the book life is not a video game not like we reach one 
of the hierarchy connection and then some voice from above is like unlocked like mortal kombat or something sc 
sk not the way the world works and maslow was very clear about that so i really try to 
the spirit of what maslow actually meant as well as the rest of the humanistic psychology it really is 
attempt more globally in this day and age in this world today to bring back a lot of the 
of the humanistic psychologies that have been lost sc but tell us what the hierarchy is what are the 
sk the original sc in sk and i revised it but in the original model you had the safety 
sorry you even had below that you had physiological needs sc okay sk like food water shelter then you 
safety needs need for a certain sense of predictability in your environment and then you have belonging and love 
he lumped them together which teased them apart and we can talk about that in my revised model but 
had love and belonging together and then he had esteem needs which is esteem from others that was a 
component of sc so not selfesteem the esteem that others hold us in sk both i would say he 
two selfcomponents of that both esteem from others as well as our own selfesteem but the problem with that 
hard to actually disentangle that because we do draw so much of our own selfesteem on the almost redundant 
of humans but then you can get to the selfactualized individual the next level is selfactualization a big leap 
sc yeah sk always viewed that as quite a jump like i feel really pumped up egowise boom now 
can laughter it seems to be a lot of steps along the way there and in a lot of 
what i try to do in my book is connect those dots i took selfactualization out as a stage 
not like we ever again life is not a video game not like you ever reach selfactualization and then 
win the princess or whatever that whatever my video game metaphor from mario brothers sc i think most people 
just in ordinary language the words physiology safety love belonging esteem but selfactualization betting most people heard either directly 
indirectly from hierarchy of needs can you tell us a little bit about what he meant by that concept 
maslow talks about it in different ways but there is one quote he used if you give me a 
to actually find it i really love this quote it was the best description of selfactualization i could find 
okay sure sk i found a unpublished essay that he really wanted to publish he was calling it critique 
selfactualization he really wanted to publish this before he died and instead it was left in an unpublished collection 
this is the quote and i think this really gets the heart of what he really thought about selfactualization 
to make a rose into a good rose rather than seek to change roses into lilies it necessitates a 
in the selfactualization of a person who may be quite different from yourself it even implies an ultimate respect 
acknowledgement of the sacredness and uniqueness of each kind of sk in a lot of ways he viewed selfactualization 
being able to that unique part of your human potentiality that is unique to you because these other forms 
these other needs these basic needs that i mentioned are things we all share and all striving towards but 
focus of selfactualization is more in realizing that unique potential within you that is in a lot of ways 
people would call it your best self in modern day language although i like that phrase because i think 
no such thing as the real self sk well i actually really like the phrase real because no such 
chuckle but i think really what he was getting at was this unique full potential of what we can 
the world and i do think there are misconceptions about it as being selfish david brooks the new york 
columnist was hating on maslow in a column a couple of years ago and i was like hell laughter 
i was reading the column i sc so very promaslow even though you update him definitely in his tradition 
yes i view him as a good friend who never met sc yeah sk and i do think as 
did maslow thought that we could have friends from prior generations it may sound a bit creepy laughter but 
can really have such a fondness for someone to get to know them so well i met daughter only 
daughter and granddaughter granddaughter jeannie who he had written about lovingly in his personal journal personal diaries jeannie was 
years old when maslow died but he would say that was the great source of my peak experiences in 
and it kills me knowing that i be able to live to see how jeannie turns sk so it 
such a peak experience for me to meet jeannie and looking at me as talking geeking out over her 
and like gosh you know so much more about my grandfather than i know about laughter than i even 
to know about my and there was something about that where it really made me feel a connection to 
even though i never met him if that makes sense sc yeah no absolutely but the good so that 
very helpful to understanding selfactualization and i do wanna move on to your version of this so i want 
spend too much time but i do want to tease out the idea that a hierarchy because this is 
important but also can be overdone and caricatured the idea that a hierarchy being that first you solve all 
physiological needs or secure them and then you go on to safety and then you go on to a 
etcetera and is that the way it works is that the way maslow thought it worked is that a 
way of thinking about it sk no not that we must satisfy something before we can go on to 
next that would be a misrepresentation he argued at any given point of time a certain percentage certain fraction 
each of those needs that we have satisfied right now i could go down the list with you and 
you maybe connection maybe esteem sc oh yeah sk you have a lot of twitter followers laughter sc not 
virgin sk maybe very high in safety and then some other need if we talk about some of my 
that i added and we can go down the percentages i think he made it clear that at any 
time we can target multiple needs simultaneously not at on any of them however he did argue he did 
the case there was a hierarchy of prepotency is what he called it and whenever i use that word 
people are are you talking i try to use that word in my book and my publisher is like 
is going to know what prepotency laughter well now what does he mean by that sk i think he 
believe that there are certain needs that he called deprivation needs when deprived of these things they shift our 
world view and narrow in a sense they narrow our world view to a particular world view and they 
do make it harder to be all that we could become which is selfactualization they really do get in 
way of selfactualization and i think that is quite right i think that what he really emphasized is not 
lockstep progression of a of something that you have to climb like a mountain you climb but more of 
integrative process where if you have wellintegrated some of these deprivation needs the whole system is really gonna be 
of whack if that makes sense sc yeah no actually it does make sense but a hierarchy in the 
that in view some of these needs are a little bit more basic even though you satisfy them before 
on as i think you correctly point out there are levels not just a list in random order sk 
there are levels which could i think that a firm scientific ground we can say that there is a 
order because individual differences there are cultural differences in which of those are more prepotent than others we could 
all at the very basic level say that things like food water shelter are essential sk i think some 
there that are hard to argue universally but there are some cultures where esteem might be more important than 
or some cultural connection might be more important what i really wanted to emphasize was this distinction i wanna 
hung up on the precise order but i wanted to talk about the dialect he had very interesting dialectical 
security and growth and really what maslow was fascinated with was that dialectical sc and that leads us directly 
your reimagining of it thrown away the pyramid too boring too stationary you have a new metaphor sk yes 
think a sail boat offers at multiple levels so to speak a better conceptualization of what it means to 
a good life what it means just just what it means to live life period all in this vast 
of the sea all traveling in our own direction but all in the same sea of unpredictability we know 
gonna be waves coming we have to secure our boat as much as possible before we can go anywhere 
a leak in our boat if severe deprivations not going anywhere sk but once we can do that we 
feel safe and comfortable to open our sail and how we open our sail also affects where we can 
and how fast we can go and all these things i really think that the sail boat does a 
job of capturing that interaction between the boat and the sail or between safety and growth sc right if 
understood it correctly the hull of the boat sitting there in the water is the story of our security 
these needs that we absolutely have to have met whereas the sail of the boat and the air around 
is the story of growth and change and trying to move through life in the best way we can 
yes and at the top of the sail is purpose and really having a clear clear direction and being 
focused and having the whole unit another thing i like about the sail boat metaphor is that all about 
integration of a whole vehicle the whole vehicle that travels through ocean not climbing piece by piece different parts 
you up this mountain that it seem to be how humans or even how thermodynamic systems work whole systems 
greater than the sum of the parts and a big big thing i try to emphasize in my book 
i am into evolution psychology sk i went through a phase of evolution psychology maybe fifteen years ago where 
i thought it was the pajamas and now what i wanna do is i wanna really show that humans 
be greater than the sum of their parts not just identified with our modules i think we can use 
evolutionary approach to understand the parts of us but ultimately interested in how the whole organism deals with those 
of human existence and lives their own good life in their own way how do they selfactualize in their 
direction or as maslow put it in their own style and to me really fascinating about humans our ability 
supersede or to become greater than the sum of the parts sc and this is where the uniqueness of 
person comes in and you wanna sort of emphasize that sk yeah no i ultimately wanna emphasize transcendence sc 
well get there like way in the future in the podcast laughter i want to get all of the 
on the table sk okay good good sc wven though you have a different metaphor of the sail boat 
than the pyramid you still have some needs you still have a list of needs that meeting in the 
of this sail boat do you even call them needs still or do you have a different name sk 
do call them needs i call them human needs for sure i call this the integrated hierarchy of needs 
revised hierarchy that revised integrated hierarchy of needs yes sc good and so which are the needs associated with 
hull of the boat sk safety which combined physiological and safety needs into one i think so much research 
that how our body and mind are so interconnected and it made sense to talk about a general level 
say level but i know what to call it now general process in which sk we can be pitched 
the state of psychological entropy the state of great uncertainty where too much unpredictable in our environment that our 
really is full of fear and anxiety and so that would be that stage and that could happen from 
it could happen from having no food on your table or roof on your head around your head above 
head but it could also be living in environment where a lot of violence in your environment that pervades 
environment or just things that are so unstable that would all be under that aspect sc in the chapter 
safety you actually talk a lot about attachment to other people maybe that is not what comes to mind 
you first start talking about safety and part of safety is having a house and food and water but 
seems to i would have put that in connection but you put it in safety the attachment we have 
other people sk yes because the opposite of secure attachment is insecure attachment when insecurely attached such anxiety especially 
you have the anxious attachment style pitched into that state of uncertain anxiety where you trust people i see 
as a really core part of this need for safety coherence in the environment but also trust that your 
will be safe to me is essential part of this need sc an ability to treat other people like 
not your enemies sk and that you can depend on them in times of great need see what attachment 
is all about can do i have trust and confidence in this caregiver when vulnerable and been studied a 
in children but there also been a lot of studies on adults as well like my relationship partner do 
trust that when things really get tough that protect and help me in those situations sc as a working 
you must know you must be very familiar with all of the different ways in which attachment is tricky 
mean attachment to other people you can be overly attached you can be clingy you want to have that 
and respect for other people without getting in their way not sure how you would put it but definitely 
balance to be struck there sk absolutely not to get too nerdy about this but really good to view 
styles as continuums not types i think that this type way of thinking has not really been very profitable 
psychologists and we really need to think about things and this applies to everything this is actually quite profound 
think a whole revision of the dsm needs to occur so that could be a whole other conversation where 
view everything all disorders as on a continuum but if we two main dimensions that we all differ on 
attachment style and avoidant attachment style those are the two fundamental dimensions we differ on and no such thing 
secure attachment type just like none of us are ever selfactualized none of us are ever securely attached sk 
you just have these two dimensions anxious and avoidant attachment styles you can actually create a space of different 
of those two of different ways that one can be insecurely attached and then you can only conceptualize secure 
the extent to which both of those are high if you see what saying sc can you explain to 
what they are what is an anxious attachment continuum and what is the avoidance sk sc this is the 
to get nerdy go nuts chuckle sk can i really get nerdy okay give me a moment i actually 
sometimes i get in these moments where never said it better than i did in the book so can 
just find that part sc sure sk okay the anxious attachment dimension reflects a concern about being rejected and 
and is the product of beliefs about whether others will be for you in times of great need the 
attachment dimension has less to do with a sense of safety and more to do with how you regulate 
emotions in response to stress whether you use others as a secure base or pull away and withdraw from 
sk now interesting because looked really closely into the literature and found something that i think is interesting in 
much more detrimental in mental health to score very very high on the anxious dimension than the avoidant dimension 
interesting that there are lot of people who score high on just the sorry who score very high on 
the avoidance dimension who are quite content with their life sc well i was gonna say from the description 
just gave it sound like one end or the other is clearly good and clearly bad for the anxious 
yeah being anxious is bad being less anxious is good but how much of ourselves we secure through other 
seems like a happy middle ground sk yes there is a lot of research showing that if both of 
dimensions are very very low so you have very low avoidance attachment and very low anxious attachment it does 
to be correlated positively with lots of forms of wellbeing in life and lots of other indicators of mental 
as well as even epigenetic research and how certain genes become activated in the stress response working as a 
or combination i think is interesting sk but there are people who very anxious attachment at all but are 
high in avoidant and an interesting combination i think been understudied in the research literature there are plenty of 
who are actually quite fine being single chuckle not being in a relationship and we well not we dr 
and their colleagues have done some interesting research looking at correlations between these different attachment styles and personality traits 
they found that who score very high on avoidant but not anxious they just score particularly high on compassion 
not high on compassion and love they report being a very not a loving but they actually report higher 
of contentment in life chuckle sc yeah i totally get that yeah sk i think interesting i think interesting 
this is a good point to digress a little bit because mentioning the research been done how much of 
conversation having here is based on data is based on experiments and empirical research versus how much of it 
a theory that hoping will be tested using data down the road sk oh my gosh i know if 
may what i wanna may do but if i may toot my own horn in a second i really 
tried to make sure everything i said in this book could be linked to robust studies i have a 
extensive references list in the bag sc there are a lot of footnotes yes sk this was something that 
working on for years and years and wanted to get right at least as right as could be in 
moment sc when you make choices like collapsing first two levels into one sk obsessed over it sc yes 
you looked at the data when you chose to do that not just like an idea you had that 
cool sk exactly right i obsessed over every little detail of this book for instance it gets really nerdy 
have i put the most nerdy things in the footnotes like believe me when i say something like a 
away line in the book like modern personality psychologists have confirmed this model of security and growth this but 
i have a huge footnote for any nerds that wanna go to the back of the book to see 
i actually mean and i actually link it to recent research on cybernetics and research being done in artificial 
not just in humans sk i think that a there are lots of different areas of human knowledge that 
coalescing that i think is quite exciting pointing to this distinction that maslow put out that that a whole 
in order for it to be fully functioning it needs both the ability to resist distraction so stability as 
as plasticity the ability to come up with new goals you can get a level in which you can 
can explain a lot of my decisions at the nerdiest level laughter sc excellent sk i guess is what 
to say yeah sc get to some more of the decisions making here still in the hull of the 
three needs that we talk about in the hull one is the safety that we just talked about the 
is connection what does that mean sk yes yes the need for connection is the need to have at 
a minimal number of intimate mutually loving or appreciating relationships in your life sc so this is more than 
getting likes on twitter sk correct and this is a point i wanted to make i have two subneeds 
comprise connection and the need for belonging and the need for intimacy and i think a lot of people 
the field of psychology have conflated the two or maybe have treated them as synonymous but when i was 
looking deep into the literature on belonging it seems like lots and lots of instances in which people strive 
the need to belong they may do so in a way that lacks intimacy say you join violent extremism 
you join a cult or a religious organization or a political organization because you have a desperate desperate deprivation 
the need to belong and the leaders of this thing you joined care at all about you sk they 
care about you to the extent to which furthering their cause but in what ways is there a reciprocal 
relationship there it seemed to me like both of those things are really important and also for the loneliness 
it dawned on me that so much of a deprivation of a need for belonging that people are going 
it in the hopes that will satisfy that hole within themselves of loneliness and then surprised when it never 
sc sorry is there a loneliness epidemic sk well i use that phrase and then i had steven pinker 
my podcast and like would not call that like you look at the history like i get your laughter 
i love him i love him to death get me wrong a friend and then all the good things 
him but he likes to take the long long long view and like but cold comfort for the billions 
people on this planet who in this generation right now in this moment of history would quite characterize it 
an do you know what saying sc well tell me what do you mean by the loneliness epidemic sk 
the rates especially among the elderly are quite staggering of reports just simple reports of loneliness if you do 
questionnaires and you ask people to report how lonely they are and it is really high among the elderly 
you also see it even in college students you see the rates are highend and not just the rates 
the impact of loneliness john cacioppo i believe how you pronounce his name he was a loneliness researcher and 
passed away as i was researching the book but he had shown that the effects of loneliness on our 
health is even greater than smoking or obesity or lots of other factors that we know are risk factors 
mortality sc but this is are saying that there is a quantitative difference in the amount of loneliness now 
when versus last year versus one hundred years ago sk yes if we wanna take the long long view 
could get on board a pinker sort of argument that not technically an epidemic because hard to make the 
that this generation is lonelier than the hippies were for instance in the and i think there is a 
there that could be made so perhaps we call and i wanna say something as well because i am 
open to for people making these arguments after my podcast chat i had with steven pinker i went back 
my book and i actually changed my book and i i think i took out the word epidemic laughter 
but just trying to understand is the claim that loneliness is increasing or is the claim simply that a 
of it sk a lot of it i wanna focus on the a lot of it aspect and i 
get stuck too much on making it a competition of some sort with prior epics or generations sc sure 
but it sc no i mean i can totally get onboard with the idea a lot of loneliness out 
sk right sc almost by definition it can be hidden from us chuckle if other people are lonely maybe 
connecting with them and the effects of it could be very bad sk the effects also what i wanted 
focus on that was mindboggling to me to look into that literature and seeing just how strong an effect 
can have not just on our minds but also our bodies and on mortality and a risk factor for 
so a greater risk factor than a lot of physical risk factors that people look at sc and so 
this connection need comes in this is the second need in the hull of your sailboat sk correct correct 
and how does it relate to the issue of introverts versus extroverts right introverts are having their day in 
sun now we have susan book sk cool sc let us love introverts again because not that they like 
just they need their own space is that related to this need for connection somehow one way or the 
sk done quite a bit of research on introversionextroversion dimension but i actually see that as irrelevant to this 
because the need suggests a i said minimal number talking about one or two and i think that is 
need regardless of where you are on the introversionextroversion dimension of personality and we could have a whole separate 
on the science the latest science of introversion because super super interested in that topic and written a lot 
it but i think actually a separate dimension sk that dimension of personality has more to do with your 
of assertiveness and your levels of enthusiasm or called positive emotions that are of the high kind i think 
can have contentness and calmness but you find extroverts tend to report higher levels of these other kinds of 
states all the time and also assertiveness sc so the connection you sk but how sc is more about 
a small number of really solid connections sk stable sc stable sk minimal number of stable and intimate so 
relatedness a relatedness aspect to it right sc okay good and the third need within the hull of the 
is selfesteem and you did put the word self in there sk yes and just one more thing about 
you could be the introversion track antisociality so this is a common misconception sc no not at all right 
yeah and i know you know that i wanna make that this is why i think this is separate 
this basic need talking something else if you have this extreme sort of aversion of any human connection well 
i think something else going on with you which we could talk about later dark triad stuff but yeah 
introversion sc right okay good sk does that makes sense sc yeah no maybe what introversion is not why 
tell us what introversion is sk oh boy well this is why this is so hotly contested because scientists 
a different view of what introversion is from what everyday people on the internet who identify themselves selfidentify as 
think of themselves so on the internet if you ask most people the introverts will say it how i 
my say do i get energized by people or not energized by people well scientists view it more in 
of the levels of dopamine and social reward sk so more simply a matter in the scientific literature of 
an introvert you simply get less reward from social information or from social rewards and i can conclude things 
the possibility of getting esteem from a person talking to or being excited for lots of novel social situations 
why you tend to find that introverts tend to prefer a couple of close people than going and networking 
a million people because when you network with a million people your dopamine system is more activated then your 
system and i think just simply a matter physiologically introverts get as much dopamine release at the possibility for 
reward with novel social encounters sk i think technically all that dimension means sc okay no that makes sense 
yeah does that make sense yeah sc it does but now is now i need a word for the 
that i need to be alone to have time to recharge my batteries chuckle what do we call that 
well we sc i mean there are some people who are energized by being out in public and some 
who are the energy seeps away when putting the effort in to do that sk but if you view 
as a dopamine thing though which is really going on then you can map it onto that in a 
because dopamine predicts how much effort we are motivated to put into something if not getting a lot of 
push for something it actually will take greater effort be more exhausting to put in the energy to do 
sc okay but sk not wrong so that metaphor of the recharge battery thing it can roughly be explained 
through what we know about the dopamine system as you have to work harder introverts would have to put 
more effort to be motivated and to talk to lots and lots of people and you could see how 
would be exhausting to them quicker than extroverts however i wrote a paper showing that there are some misconceptions 
because been some studies showing that both introverts and extroverts do get tired extroverts do get tired from at 
certain point just talking about thresholds all personality is all human and this is a big point of my 
all human sk we can get too stuck on these different types personality types not realizing that look you 
talk to experts and they would still be able to resonate with that feeling of talked to too many 
today i need to chuckle okay human too human too really just talking about thresholds and i think that 
could be explained physiologically through the dopamine system and how we know dopamine when you dopamine can be an 
force do you know what i mean for things that are possibility of rewards sc yeah good okay i 
that does clear something up very useful sk yay sc and certainly separate from your notion of connection so 
on to selfesteem the third need right there in the hull of the boat so what do you mean 
that sk selfesteem is and i focus on a healthy selfesteem which has two components a healthy sense of 
of good enough mean that better than others and i go great pains to distinguish selfesteem from narcissism different 
and they have different developmental pathways just worthy and the second component of a healthy selfesteem is mastery or 
people call it selfcompetence or even just competence or selfefficacy a generalized form of selfefficacy across all the different 
of my life i feel a general sense of in control of my life the driver of this life 
can do things i can make things happen i have agency and the selfworth part is not just about 
it is a distinguishable component from competence sk so with selfworth more tied to social relations am i a 
social partner we tend to tie our selfworth to being viewed as a social partner as well as liking 
some people actually will call that in the psychological literature call it selfliking versus selfcompetence and they can actually 
apart these two forms of selfesteem for instance those who score very very high in narcissism tend to feel 
great sense of competence almost an exaggerated sense but they actually like themselves that much this is fascinating when 
man that would be terrible to be that kind of narcissist chuckle if you even like yourself why be 
narcissist at all sk yeah so funny well they can fully admit especially grandiose narcissists and i actually distinguish 
different types of narcissists i tell you really nerdy i could distinguish between the more vulnerable quiet introverted form 
narcissism from the more braggadocio or whatever that form of narcissism but grandiose narcissists they have such an inflated 
of their competence but if you do these kinds even implicit selfesteem measures and you have measures like a 
person or a valued social partner or i like myself i think i like myself kind of neutral to 
on that aspect laughter sc alright good to know helpful knowledge when we meet narcissists to go like you 
are not happy with chuckle sk yeah sc that makes me a bad person that i want to do 
okay so security we have it sussed right the water that our boat floats in and the boat itself 
a story of safety and connection and selfesteem but as important as those things are you really get juiced 
when we start talking about the sail and how we can move and how we can do things the 
aspect of all this sk exactly right meza called it the growing tip when you have a tree a 
portion of the tree that grows much much more than the other parts of the tree and i always 
that metaphor of the growing tip i thought that was kind of brilliant but yeah really interested in what 
these potentialities within us as humans that really help us grow and evolve as a species sc and your 
one you once again have three needs that we associate with this sail the first one is exploration what 
that mean sk right you could in a way view this whole thing as two different triangles two different 
when pitched in the state of security and your whole world that base is safety but when in the 
realm of human existence you can actually have two different realms of human existence i know if you knew 
sean chuckle sc i know sk you can have the deprivation form of human existence where everything becomes about 
trying to impart on the world like making demands on the world like me love me respect but when 
the growth realm of existence which is the realm entering now in this conversation the base of that is 
no everything is not pivoting around the need to resolve a deprivation now everything revolves around a general spirit 
actively entering the unknown sc right you can exist from moment to moment but gonna seek out some new 
sk correct excited by the unknown as opposed to fearing it intensely which is what psychological entropy is all 
sc well actually talk about psychological entropy because i just had a i know this is my thing but 
had a very interesting conversation with carl friston the neuroscientist who has a whole theory of free energy and 
forth and it gets very technical but the very short version is that he thinks that brains and even 
work to model the world in such a way so as to minimize the surprise that they experience and 
course one question was we seek out surprise all the we do explore we do read mystery novels or 
and his answer to that which i thought was interesting was that secretly a strategy on the part of 
brain to anticipate the future so be surprised now so that you have a more complete and flexible model 
the world so as to minimize the total amount of surprise integrated over your future life sc do you 
that makes sense sk i do i think that the need for exploration evolved as a need all on 
but it primarily as a anxietyreducing function i think consistent with what he he said and also by the 
i consulted these folks i had skype chats with the whole group a lot of these people who studied 
physics of entropy and trying to apply it to the brain and i think that i could and i 
i did make a good case in the book for the need for exploration having own evolved function and 
being reduced to the need for safety or anxiety but i do think it evolved in order to help 
with that anxietyreducing functioning it sk the more that we can prepare ahead of time and the more that 
can reduce that uncertainty by actively seeking i really connect the need for exploration with the informationseeking aspects of 
there is some recent research distinguishing between the social aspects of dopamine or the more what are called repetitive 
cocaine sex a status and there are dopamine pathways that get us really excited at the possibility of those 
and there are listeners that when i said those three sc getting excited chuckle sk their brain is particularly 
releasing the dopamine in the synapses like in mofo but there are also and i suspect a lot of 
listeners who just by the nerdier we get in this conversation they are also releasing dopamine into other dopamine 
more related to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and i think a really interesting new line of research and understanding 
there might be dopamine pathways that give us excitement at the possibility of information not just the possibility for 
opportunities sc so saying that equations lead to dopamine release sk yes i do i think that some some 
evidence that may be a separate pathway and i think it could still be debated and still trying to 
is it really just the same pathways but individual differences and et cetera and ways that this could be 
but i think that it is possible too there are different pathways there are pathways that project specifically to 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and are working in memory that gives us excitement when our working memory is active with 
that may give us greater information to survive sc i think this is your next book right here why 
releases dopamine this is gonna be absolutely killer i know people who would buy this book scott telling you 
also it makes me wonder about there since talking about the uniqueness of different individuals there are absolutely people 
hate being in a routine and there are absolutely other people who love being in a routine right there 
people who love having a job where you get to wear the same uniform every day and other people 
would find that inner torment how do we distinguish between those people how do we give them both space 
be valid sk yes well this is a great point this is where we get to the realm of 
differences and as i talk about in the need for safety chapter there are people who maybe they are 
in neuroticism personality trait high in they have obsessivecompulsive disorder at a very high level or other things that 
them an intense need to control the world and that may be a more pressing need for them than 
need for exploration and spent maybe ten years of my career studying the personality trait openness to experience which 
the extent to which neuroticism predicts the need for security openness to experiences predicts the need for exploration i 
sc and these are elements in the big five personality inventory right sk correct i just mentioned two of 
big five and we already went deep into the extroversion and introversion one so which are the ones we 
left to discuss today grit and we talked about grit conscientiousness and we talked about agreeableness being a good 
although we did kinda talk about aholes a little bit sc yeah we talked about agreeableness a little bit 
have to get to conscientiousness sk yeah your question is good and i wanted to make it clear that 
these are all needs of humans we do differ quite a bit at different points in our life how 
they are for us so i think regardless of our personality i think contextually as well these these needs 
ebb and flow but also based on our own temperament we these needs can ebb and flow there are 
people that really i think genetics plays a role here care a lot more about belonging and intimacy sc 
i think that the lesson of what saying here is that exploration is important as a part of this 
aspect of the needs but it is something where you try to just push it to the maximum you 
be surprised every moment of your life there is an appropriate amount of newness and newness to experience an 
for any one person given who they are and what interested in sk yes i really do think that 
fully functioning system requires both safety and growth security and growth and also been other labels like i used 
like stability and plasticity but i think any fully functioning system is going to have to reconcile with both 
some point in their life sc good okay the next need on our sail is love interesting because putting 
here in the growth part of the needs not in the security part sk yeah i did and i 
to one thing i did is i separate belonging from intimacy within the need for connection but the other 
i wanna do is i wanted to separate an unconditional form of love a higher spiritual form of love 
from connection i wanted to get it out of the boat and into the sail because when you project 
in your sail you can do that to anyone it have to be only the people you like or 
the people you feel a sense of relatedness to you sc so a more cosmic aspect to love sk 
absolutely an attitude love is an attitude not necessarily a feeling in fact you could hate someone in terms 
the feeling label we put hate on that feeling but still have blove and this is what maslow called 
love for the being of others and the sacredness of others even if different from who our being is 
can just admire people for who they are not what trying to get out of them or what they 
do or the usefulness they have for us sc right sk even in the level of connection still about 
still making demands on people to with but at the blove level of human existence you make those sorts 
demands sc more that offering something to the world rather than just asking things of it sk right sc 
and then the third need in the sail is purpose and this is the one i wanna talk about 
most but i have my doubts but i wanna hear your sales pitch first sk i wait to hear 
own thoughts on sc i know cause the most important one to you i know sk well i actually 
the most important if you actually asked me to choose i may actually choose transcendency which go in in 
second but the point i wanted to make there is if i had to choose i would choose the 
of them all sc sure sk okay yeah yeah like the spoiler sc totally cheating but okay go ahead 
sk yeah yeah but purpose a tough one to define although i do have a precise definition in the 
how did i define it the need for purpose can be defined as the need for an overarching aspiration 
energizes efforts and provides a central source of meaning and significance in life the way i think about purpose 
we can have multiple purposes but a more super ordinate goal and it serves as an organizing framework so 
speak for all of our other goals so that we can see if our other goals in our hierarchy 
be less abstract levels or broad levels of abstraction are working together as a whole unit in making sure 
realizing that highest level goal or aspiration or one could just colloquially call it a dream chuckle dream sk 
lost everyone in what i just said we can say just having a dream a really broad dream making 
that we really can reach it to our full capacity that not having things that are taking away unnecessarily 
our capacity to realize that dream but love to get your thoughts sc well i completely agree that having 
purpose of the form that you talk about can really help right can really give somebody momentum direction and 
in their lives but i have a bunch of questions one of which is do we really need that 
people be just as happy without some sort of big picture future goal in mind can there be real 
living in the moment without necessarily having a purpose and can that be just as rewarding sc this is 
legitimate question not a leading question open to whatever the answer might be sk so yes and a terrific 
question one that i had quite a bit back and forth with ken and sheldon who did a lot 
the research that i tried to synthesize in that chapter he talk he use the word purpose he talks 
selfconcordant goals the importance of setting the right goals that will lead to growth and when i told him 
was kind of framing this in terms of purpose and everything he was very skeptical of that and he 
like i teach my students worry about this purpose is so it sounds so dramatic and daunting also can 
a bit of a dramatic person too sc okay sk purpose yeah resonates more with my being something exciting 
thrilling about having a super ornate goal that gives you like a hierarchy of meaning in your life i 
fair to say there are some goals you have that give you a deeper sense of meaning than other 
like the goal to just get out of bed in the morning chuckle is not your purpose in life 
an important goal sc well this is this is what if i were to be more playing the advocate 
i sometimes try to do in the podcast context sk i love it i love it sc one of 
criticisms against maslow was that it was a little elitist his conception of psychology right he was looking at 
people who had been most successful in lives sk not successful i would correct you there he did not 
selfactualization with achievement sc okay but he was looking at people like gandhi and einstein and so forth right 
was not looking at people who he met randomly on the street sk well a fair point a fair 
chuckle although i saw an interview with his a very precious interview with his wife bertha after maslow died 
interviewing her about how he thought about selfactualization and she said really thought my mother was selfactualized was way 
selfactualized than he thought he himself and his mother was really a good her mother was a good kind 
but not someone who had achieved a lot sk and if you actually look at writings he started off 
hold of selfactualization he started called what he called the good human being notebook he was just taking down 
of who he thought were the best specimens of humanity in the sense that they were good people and 
think that gets lost a lot in this notion of selfactualization and actually the spirit upon what he went 
this he thought that selfactualized people represent best in humanity but he did not equate it with high achievement 
okay that aside individual thoughts aside i think that there is a danger for you it might have been 
for me when i think about people in moral philosophy for example like john stuart mill trying to make 
between higher and lower pleasures or people who talk about the meaning of life and they associate it with 
sort of creative work or changing the world in some way and all of this sounds and i have 
goals and purposes myself but the idea that what it should be does sound a little bit elitist to 
i think that plenty of space out there again playing the advocate for just living for just saying like 
wake up in the morning with my grand plan i just wanna be good at the day and i 
find meaningfulness in the competency and compassion with which i approach the every day small and if you wanna 
well that counts as a purpose then fine but i think what people think of when you say the 
purpose sk i think right and if you wanna talk about sc we do we do sk at some 
there is a grand or not a grand reveal a twist ending to this book and been holding off 
it like i want people to read the book but there is a twist ending sc okay m night 
sk it you say you say sc okay m night shyamalan laughter sk i know i know the m 
shyamalan of psychology no no that speaks directly to the heart of what saying and that was a twist 
as well because he thought it was all about selfactuation all about this grand purpose and mission having a 
outside yourself and then he faced his own mortality and he suddenly care about any of that stuff anymore 
it confused the heck out of him and he wrote in his book is so strange that this experience 
mortality which is in a sense taken me all the way to the bottom not of a pyramid but 
me focus on this lower need has actually increased my sense of transcendence and appreciation of the world more 
ever had in my entire life and it has made me care less about the competitiveness drive or the 
drive or the sk so this was a real paradox that he was trying to work out in the 
yearandahalf of his life before he did succumb to a heart attack at the age of sixtytwo suddenly sc 
this is good and i do wanna sort sorry about your book and your dramatic instincts i wanna totally 
the ending of your book here in the podcast and talk about transcendence but i do have one more 
about purpose which is i think one that many people will have which is where is it supposed to 
from i mean can it be completely arbitrary does it matter which purpose we have there are people here 
the united states of america who build the largest ball of twine or chuckle something like that and is 
just as good as people who find a cure for cancer sk oh just as good wow a heavy 
and i would be the last one to start to claim the arbitrator of chuckle built this sc no 
think you are i think your job laughter sk oh boy something but i wanna emphasize that this is 
integrated hierarchy of needs we view any one of these as separate from the whole system or the whole 
and really thought this out i really thought this out in a very very ocd level chuckle but if 
about building purpose on a foundation of expiration and love the way of being that i think leads to 
transcendence that talking about and not talking about a purpose being driven by your deprivation needs like ego and 
desperate need to fulfill a hole within yourself i do think that we can call purpose we can call 
just a deep deep or a goal that gives us a deep sense of satisfaction when we work toward 
sk if fine we get rid of for the purposes of this conversation just so on the same page 
can get rid of the word purpose and we just talk about a dream an overarching aspiration or even 
a goal that is higher priority of meaning for us than other goals even just that even just at 
basic level and you combine that with a sense of exploration and a sense of blove for humanity being 
by a spirit of wanting to make the world a better place i think those three things work as 
whole unit in allowing us to transcend ourselves and the point i wanted to make in the book sc 
and maybe focus more specifically in on transcendence when i read that part of your book i thought of 
zen story about the monk who was asked what is the difference in his life before and after he 
enlightened stop me if heard this one but he said before i became enlightened i would chop wood and 
water and now that enlightened i chop wood and carry chuckle sc it the whole story sk yeah i 
he does it in an enlightened way now chuckle is that a related in some way to the idea 
transcending sure that he sort the idea was he conceptualized and perceived it and got a different kind of 
from it postenlightennment but his stuff that he was doing to get through the day was just the same 
sk right very right and i do love that i talk about healthy transcendence as different from unhealthy transcendence 
a lot sk this is an overarching framework for everything in life by the way i think everything in 
is neither good or bad it has a deprivation flavor to it and a growth flavor to it and 
can apply to anything you start to view the world that way i think it really opens your eyes 
to a lot you can have deprivation humor which is very selfdeprecating or maybe aggressive towards others but you 
have a more growthoriented form of humor sk you can have a form of aggression that is very deprivationmotivated 
you can have the martin luther king kind of aggression which is like gonna use this to uplift all 
humanity you can go down the line and i think the same applies to transcendence i think you have 
deprivation form of transcendence which you see in the world today with these socalled gurus who claim to be 
humanity not saying all the gurus chuckle i am not trying to piss off the all of the gurus 
but saying there are some that you see they abuse their position of power or you see that they 
of have being motivated clearly as i see it through narcissism and through these security needs not through growth 
but i do think a form of healthy transcendence sits wellintegrated and is not about being above humanity but 
being a part of humanity as much as possible and i think different those are different conceptualizations of what 
means and the kind talking about is a sense of great great connectedness to the rest of humanity just 
being who you are not saying that you are sacrificing yourself a high level of integration where at the 
level of integration a seamlessness between you and the world i am actually gonna stop on that sc okay 
no very good that seamlessness between you and the world i think very powerful image and maybe in fact 
answers the question i was just going to ask which is the word transcend or transcendence begs a question 
what is it that we are transcending and do you have a simple answer to that is it a 
that transcending or is it more vague than that sk well one could at the most simplistic level say 
the ego a very simplistic way of saying it and then one would say is the and i would 
ego could be defined in a million different ways and then the self has a million different definitions chuckle 
for purposes of our conversation one could define the ego as all those aspects of ourself that are the 
aspects of ourselves are the ones that tie us to security as much as possible and to the relief 
risk and the potential for a pain sk our defense mechanisms so in a lot of ways it really 
transcending no longer needing our needs in a way sc got it so the needs that are being transcended 
the need for our needs maybe a better way of saying it yeah sk correct correct sc okay very 
good is people should read your book to find out more i want them to think of they learned 
a long book full of footnotes and a lot more detailed than we were able to get into here 
thank you i appreciate that more but really given me quite the opportunity here today to really i hope 
in the weeds laughter sc no we like the weeds the weeds is where we live this is what 
me gonna get a million comments on youtube saying thank you for going into the weeds more weeds sk 
good i truly hope that people do like to listen to us nerd out at this level and that 
can gain value from that because this is not i realize this is not your selfhelp book that just 
you the five steps to lead a better life and i do have an appendix of exercises but i 
that there are enough people out there that wanna just be told what to do they wanna know the 
and science behind it and i try to balance both those things sc but make it clear for potential 
in the book and also on your website you do have actual specific actionable items that people can do 
try to help themselves transcend in the sense talking about right sk i do and a lot of these 
i adapted from exercises i called them growth challenges that i have my students do i teach a course 
the science of living well and you see i see transformations this is not only tested through science in 
formally peerreviewed through articles through hundred and hundreds of students who have said that this way of thinking about 
world and these kinds of exercises have helped them grow and transcend themselves in powerful ways and these exercise 
a lot of them are not your standard happiness exercises because happiness is not my goal here my goal 
growth so yeah chuckle sc this is gonna be deflationary but i love the story in your book about 
moving to brandize and teaching the class and then at the end like the end of the semester one 
the student says this gonna be on the test can you tell me gonna be the and like learned 
from anything that taught all of this course laughter sk and ironically that happened to be in my class 
of course sk and i help but then relay the story of maslow and i that student i appreciate 
sc well and of course you also have a podcast tell people about your podcast so they know about 
sk sure i have something i have a podcast called the psychology podcast sc great that you were able 
steal to get that name before anyone else did very good marketing sk i got it i got it 
now others have to try to steal mine but i steal sc you steal it that was a mistake 
my part sk no i know i know sc you were there first sk i was there first and 
such a great opportunity for me to find the leading psychologists maybe even names of psychologists that the household 
names but i can still give them a platform because i still think leading and doing great stuff and 
all aspects of the human mind and human nature and human variation nothing is off limits chuckle up for 
respectfully and compassionately on my podcast so been great great fun i really i think a sk i really 
believe a lot of the listeners of your podcast would enjoy some of the episodes if not a lot 
the episodes of my podcast sc yeah no i think a great thought and a great place to end 
scott barry kaufman thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast sk thank you for having me on 
great music pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast scott barry kaufman on the psychology of transcendence three quarks daily great 
thank you what is the growth challengesactionable items mentioned at the end of the conversation i really enjoyed this 
i like new metaphor for hierarchy of needs a sail boat it reminded me of victoria song which was 
by garth brooks the song ends with will sail my vessel the river runs when the improbability of self 
existence is considered it begs the question is materialism sufficient to explain all of reality i have a real 
with maslow and other similar theories because it uses circular reasoning for example people eat because they have a 
to eat how do you know that they have a need to eat because they i understand that logicians 
call this a tautology seems as though you have explained eating but you have explained nothing i used eating 
as an example but you can substitute any of and you have the same problem many theorists who use 
cognitive or mental terminology have the same problem as well the only way to break out of the circle 
to define to in terms other than eating for example you could show that when blood sugar drops people 
more now you know something that is meaningful and possibly useful but the concept of is no longer required 
eat because their blood sugar is low you do not need to say low blood sugar creates a need 
eat so and that makes people eat i noticed that kaufman mentioned dopamine a few times and even the 
cortex that would be a better place to look if you want to understand needs the other perhaps more 
objection to maslowtype theories is that they cannot generate any crucial falsifiable predictions like freudian theory they can provide 
framework for explaining events after they happen but are unable to predict what will happen and cannot be tested 
makes them unscientific i loved his spontaneous bursts of laughter bill mckim it is not clear to me why 
about needs involves us in circular reasoning i think there are any actual psychologists that fall prey to the 
you have outlined there any psychologists who when attempting to explain why eating is a need simply point out 
we do in fact eat and consider that an explanation eating is a need because if we eat we 
and it is possible to explain physiologically why we die if we get enough nutrition short of death we 
study the effects that malnutrition has on things like ability in school mental and physical health and so on 
we can see that people who are malnourished are not able to meet the same potential they would be 
to meet if they were more adequately nourished to use a less basic need we know people have a 
for connection because we can study all the negative effects of extreme loneliness the negative effects that people suffer 
in solitary confinement and so on and there are lots of psychologist who have done this no one thinks 
have a need for connection simply because we observe people trying to connect we have a norm for what 
think constitutes a good human life and we are able to observe and study the ways in which the 
to meet certain needs gets in the way of achieving what we consider to be a good human life 
think there is any circularity there in regard to falsifiable predictions it is necessary to specify the level at 
we are making predictions i use theories to predict what a particular individual is going to do tomorrow what 
are going to eat for breakfast whether they are going to accept a job offer or go to college 
etc no psychological theory can do that and i doubt any psychological theory will ever be able to do 
so if that is the criterion for a scientific psychological theory there will never be one however with theory 
can predict that in general if we deprive people of things like connection and esteem we are going to 
negative consequences in mental and physical health the degree of satisfaction the person reports feeling about their life and 
on theories would be falsified to some degree if it turned out there were no negative effects of depriving 
of all human connection to give just one example so i think these theories are falsifiable i so enjoyed
