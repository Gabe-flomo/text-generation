sean carroll and if familiar with my book big or any of the various talks given on that book 
that one of my favorite factoids is that the average human lifespan is three billion heartbeats not a very 
fact if you just take the fact that the average human being lives for about seventyfive years and do 
dimensional analysis to convert from years to heartbeats the number works out to be about three billion for a 
human being stretching from birth to death sc but an interesting fact because it brings home in a slightly 
vivid way how short our life is three billion is a big number but not unimaginably big and unlike 
heartbeats are going by all the time squandered several of your heartbeats already listening to me talk right here 
learned this fact about the three billion heartbeats from guest dr geoffrey west a distinguished professor at the santa 
institute and the context of a much more profound fact about biological organisms here on earth if you take 
particular kind of organism say mammals because human beings are mammals they come in all shapes and sizes tiny 
mice big old blue whales or elephants but there are relationships between the size of an animal in mass 
example the number of kilograms the thing has and other biological facts such as how long it lives bigger 
whales and elephants live for much longer than tinier things like mice or squirrels sc meanwhile another relationship between 
size and your heart rate big animals like whales and elephants have very slow heartbeats tiny animals have very 
heartbeats and you can see where this is going these two facts exactly cancel out the average number of 
for mammals is approximately the same for tiny little mice or big old blue whales or elephants not an 
relationship in fact the number for a typical mammal works out not to be three billion but one and 
half billion which maybe you could argue is roughly what we had we human beings back in the state 
nature before we had pasteurized milk and obamacare and things like that but the point is that something is 
on that goes beyond mere biology some reason why a relationship between how fast your heart beats how massive 
are and how long you live sc what got guest geoffrey west interested in biology networks and complex systems 
started his academic life as a particle physicist but he read about these scaling relations and he realized from 
physics point of view no one understood them no one knew why things were like that so he and 
collaborators developed a theory that explains why you get this relationship as an animal gets bigger it lives longer 
its heart slows down the pace of life is slower for larger animals these days extending that analysis not 
to individual animals but to cities or cultures or other kinds of networks that fill our daily lives today 
kind of analysis is absolutely crucial for sustainability for thinking about how we live in the world for choosing 
to manage our life here on earth geoffrey west is the former president of the santa fe institute and 
author of a wonderful recent book called the universal laws of growth innovation sustainability and the pace of life 
organisms cites economies and not the most elegant title give you that but an extremely important and hopefully influential 
that helps us understand the world we live in so go music sc geoffrey west welcome to the podcast 
west hey nice to be here sean thank you for inviting me sc so i have to ask when 
an airplane going to a conference traveling around the world and you find yourself sitting next to an inquisitive 
and they say what do you do for a laughter what is your answer to that kind of question 
oh goodness me a tough one and it always stops me in my tracks but because slightly misanthropic and 
what do i say i think i always lead off pretty much by saying a and then i quickly 
a physicist but i work now a lot and questions challenges that are considered outside of usual physics and 
quite a lot of work in what i would consider fundamental questions in biology and now about cities companies 
particularly interested in the whole question of global sc right gw so i sort of do it in that 
mean maybe not quite as linearly as that but effectively sc but now in your youth you were more 
less mainstream gw absolutely sc so what kinds of things did you work on then and what happened gw 
yeah so most of my career meaning the first i did definitely what you would call mainstream particle physics 
entering it when i would say the kinds of things you work on and made your name on were 
way out laughter they questions a real physicist should be answering or asking sc right dark era gw yeah 
it was like come on you know and i think one of the by the way just tangentially one 
the great things that has happened in physics is that we do ask those questions and we address them 
and now developed into its own thing and a profound influence but back then i was the mainstream physicist 
well i entered it very fortunately at a really opportune moment because these famous experiments which got the nobel 
at stanford on which eventually we interpreted as discovering quarks were taking place the results were just coming out 
i had been sort sc this is the early gw well they were the late actually late i got 
phd in and those the accelerator at stanford was just being completed and the first experiments were being performed 
the results that changed everything which were results on an experiment that at the time was thought of as 
and uninteresting appeared and they were quite surprising and as i say eventually they were interpreted as the evidence 
quarks and that was a very exciting period as one tried to interpret those experiments try to formulate models 
then theories and ultimately the evolution towards something called quantum chromodynamics sc qcd gw qcd the theory of the 
interactions and that was very exciting sc and did you feel that this is what life was going to 
like every few years you would discover a new layer of structure of matter new fundamental laws gw absolutely 
in fact i would say during that period from probably onwards through the into the early we were kind 
spoiled because every year there was a new fantastic discovery that or confirmation of something and it was just 
marvelous period and it culminated in the development of the socalled standard model where we see some part of 
unification or at least we saw that you could contemplate grand unification of the electromagnetism with the strong forces 
so on and that was just immensely exciting and then that led to this naivety that it would only 
a few more years when we could get gravity into the picture gw as i say it really was 
period of immense excitement but a period of being spoiled as one does it reminds me a bit it 
is sort of interesting when i look back on it because it also had some of the flavor of 
and in society you know the emergence from the and early and kind of the image of suburban america 
your children the image of that we all had to suddenly the psychedelic revolution the vietnam war and what 
demonstrations and antiwar movement brought the civil rights movement sc but then we hit the reagan era gw and 
we hit exactly and so it is that in physics we hit not because of a ronald reagan or 
there was a vote but because it turns out that nature was not quite as forthcoming as we thought 
we smart enough despite what i do think was even though been quite critical of it i think an 
development and that is of string theory sc right gw it was a marvelous leap sc but you did 
discoveries andor confirmations and there was a shift so after the mid to late there a lot of more 
coming our way we were confirming things that we had models that explained and indeed sort of the dirty 
secret of particle physics there been any gw no exactly exactly been nothing that is sort in fact the 
things as you know better than i of gravitational waves of the higgs particle and so on are confirmations 
things that in one case were predicted i know whatever seventy years ago or whatever or longer actually and 
the other forty years ago or whatever been but a long time but i mean very exciting that we 
confirmed those but also especially in the case of the higgs it really in some ways like the end 
something sc right gw rather than i mean gravitational waves i think you could see it is the end 
something in a certain way but also the beginning of something sc for astronomy certainly the beginning of something 
it is exactly and the thing now even so that we can use it as a tool again whereas 
higgs is sort of putting a full stop a period at the end of something now done and the 
questions that have been there since the midtolate remain a how does gravity fit but even within grand unified 
with all these parameters and where do they unified in a certain sense but in the sense that a 
would like ultimately still a long way away sc no one thinks the right final theory of everything what 
have right now but compatible with all the data this presumably played a role in your choice to become 
less mainstream physicist gw yes well it did in the following sense that it was frustrating as time went 
but also we suddenly developed this idea putting all our eggs into the superconducting super collider basket and with 
idea that with this longer reach of energy it would reveal something exciting new it would in fact confirm 
higgs of course sc and this was to be sort of the united version of the large hadron gw 
sc but bigger and better and maybe even sooner had it all come to be gw absolutely and in 
one of the great ironies again maybe use the word little this is also a sort of dirty little 
i think is that in the days in which people were promoting the ssc you know to get the 
for it and just to drum up the general interest of course cern the europeans had responded by saying 
make this large hadron which would be almost an order of magnitude less in energy and the little was 
the us physics community continually bad mouthed the lhc it was like useless there is no reason to believe 
they can discover reach just far enough certainly gotta go to whatever it was fifteen or ultimately twenty and 
little is in the context of now that the lhc is the only game in town and we are 
in it and it discovered the higgs all we could do is talk how fantastic it is and what 
great idea laughter so physicists are also prone to emotions and politics and all the rest sc human beings 
human beings so not blaming anyone but it is but we sometimes certainly in those days i would say 
think the high energy physics community was of course very arrogant because it felt it was doing the most 
and therefore the most important science on the planet but also that we were immune from the human foibles 
as this and i think both of those things have been damaged and rightfully i think i think we 
overly arrogant overly selfinvolved selfcentered it ended with calling string theory the theory of everything which already connotes a 
attitude towards everything else right laughter gw so and i think been in a certain sense been healthy for 
field actually to be honest sc sorry the does it gw no meaning this extraordinary intellectual narcissism coupled with 
which i think might have served us well for quite a long while not saying that was necessary sc 
not questioning yourself does motivate you gw yes it does and especially when you think doing the most exciting 
physics that has universal applicability and is the meaning of life kind of thing sc yeah right gw and 
exciting and that was mostly unsaid part of the culture sc but when the superconducting super collider was cancelled 
congress in the so that affected gw that certainly affected me yes it did yeah it affected me for 
reasons but it also because i was at los alamos at the time and we had some significant involvement 
building one of the detectors with in fact led by barry barish from sc my caltech colleague gw your 
colleague who of course got the nobel prize for the ligo experiment but we were heavily involved in that 
i was the theorist i directly heavily involved but that was part of our program but also gone off 
a slight tangent here there was another phenomenon so i was in my at the time and i come 
a line of shortlived males sc ah laughter gw my father died at my grandfather at and so on 
none of us the male line live very long it turns out and for different reasons by the way 
is interesting of itself but the reason i say that is because i grew up with the idea that 
was exceedingly unlikely or rather you expect to die at about age sc wow gw and here i was 
know i know what it was fiftyfour or and i realized my god had the death of the ssc 
it was at the time and i probably only have five sc lots of stretching gw maybe stretch it 
years and wow when i should start thinking about what gonna do when i grow up kind of thing 
now the ssc is gone this has a big psychological but another thing was happening the death of the 
was driven by to some extent by a big antiscience movement in the us which comes up every once 
a while but in particular it was an antiphysics one and even more particular it was an antihigh energy 
one so that it was a very peculiar situation that even our colleagues in other parts of physics were 
supportive and in fact they had this mistaken idea that if they killed the ssc they would all be 
kind of image which turned out to be completely untrue sc to be fair the ssc would have been 
gw of course sc and had all that money going to the rest of physics they would have been 
but that this never would happen gw no it was a humongous amount of money on the scale of 
science experiment no question and there were obviously questions about its viability what it would actually do it and 
all kinds of good questions but nevertheless okay there was this particular antihigh energy physics but one of the 
i used to hear both at los alamos which after all is a national lab with huge numbers of 
going from the weapons program all the way through to the multiple areas particularly the physical sciences but i 
heard it in the holes of the of department energy which were the funding agency for the ssc was 
famous statement was the science of the and centuries biology is the science of the and the corollary which 
usually not said but i did hear it said was no need to do any more fundamental physics we 
all the physics we need to that sc that was said very explicitly gw very explicitly and that really 
me and so i reacted emotionally to the idea well first of all on reflection it was obvious biology 
gonna be a major science of the century no one could doubt that it was clear it was poised 
that sc and if your question had been we know all the fundamental particle physics we need to do 
and then the answer is gw yes sc there are other kinds of physics gw absolutely i understood that 
string theory or grand unification will have no impact on biology gw no impact so this is one of 
should discuss that because i think it remains an issue why are we doing things that have in any 
that we could immediately conceive anyway any foreseeable influence on betterment of human life on the planet making america 
again or whatever in fact well very much like to come back to that sc okay gw but along 
personal lines i i reacted a to the idea that nonsense you know really crazy that you gotta support 
the physics and you gotta have people think about fundamental questions if we are to address fundamental questions in 
sort of part of the culture and more specifically i reacted by saying that if biology were a real 
laughter it would you know have equations and principles and be able to mathematize things i mean all very 
we all know the principle of natural selection contribution was fantastic but except in a limited way it predict 
kinds of things we in physics would think you would need to predict if it were a complete theory 
you would want a curve that you could fit get data to and see how beautiful your prediction is 
exactly and in fact i used to say very very sarcastically you had a real theory then you could 
that they should be human i mean which is taking it to an extreme so i would push back 
that at various meetings and discussions and then i started to think god maybe i should take that biology 
does what i would say is biology needs not just the techniques that physics uses the mathematical techniques but 
and possibly even more important it needs to integrate in a way of thinking a certain culture which and 
must tell you this was out of this arrogance of the high energy physicists and also out of ignorance 
biology so it was really emotional you know i sc a perfect storm really gw perfect storm for disaster 
then i started thinking about it and i combined these two things the fact that maybe i was gonna 
soon the ssc is dead and telling us that physics should be dead the kind of physics excited about 
we should all be doing biology and i thought about that i thought know i wonder if biology were 
science like physics there ought to be in a biology book a calculation of why it is that my 
even though only gonna live to or i thought at that time conceivably i live to a where does 
one hundred years come from so i started reading biology books sc so worried not about why but why 
a second or a millennium gw yeah so where does the where does the overall the physicist way of 
not just the mechanism what is the mechanism leading through aging to mortality but what sets the scale of 
of lifespan of the one hundred years so i started reading and i went to the libraries and i 
a great time studying the literature because it was easy to read because it turned out to my amazement 
the question of mortality and even aging is it was then a complete back water really relative to most 
the other things that you think about and you and a metric of that is the following gw i 
looking at these big fat biology textbooks that they use in undergraduate biology classes they cover all of biology 
they were very useful by the way in my own education just obviously learning things that i had not 
educated about but look in those and i quickly discovered that i must have read at least half a 
maybe more and i discovered sure a chapter on metabolism a chapter on growth a chapter on reproduction on 
and even ecology and so on nothing on mortality or aging you could look in the index most of 
even mention it and i thought is when you think about it the second most important event in an 
sc yeah gw birth and death and nothing about death and i was absolutely shocked at that and then 
discovered as i say reading that and it was fairly easy to read the literature because there was not 
technical stuff having been done it was stuff that you only had to know sort of freshman biology to 
able to follow it and there was nothing quantitative almost nothing there were survival curves and so on sc 
remember i invited biologist bonnie bassler to give a colloquium in the caltech physics department and she talked about 
and quorum sensing and the students were blown away because they were pounding our graduate students in physics were 
their heads against these problems that they really needed to work hard just to ask a question that we 
the answer to and in biology like i know the answer to half a dozen questions that you think 
over the afternoon right gw sure sure exactly so it was quite different so anyway i started in the 
sort of speak or when i was stuck on the physics i was doing which was very easy to 
stuck on because i was still doing string theory or being slightly depressed about the ssc i would work 
this problem think about it read as i said a lot of the literature and i started thinking about 
and that caught and one of the things i quickly discovered in the literature were these remarkable scaling laws 
because in looking at the literature for longevity i learned that there was an approximate scaling law for longevity 
a function of size function of the mass of an organism and it was relatively simple one even though 
was a lot of variation in a lot of noise in the data sc sure of course how should 
think about what a scaling law is gw yeah so talk about that because i a good point of 
so a scaling law in its most simple form is you take any system and you ask what happens 
i increase all of its lengths by a certain parameter double its size triple its size what happens so 
simplest obviously is if you take a rectangle and you double the size of each side the area double 
goes up by a factor of two times two which is four so very trivial and the volume of 
similar object goes by a factor of eight two times two times two the simplest form of of scaling 
scaling law one case a square and the other case a cube gw so generalizing that one can then 
just go immediately to biology if i measure some characteristic of an organism and it could be something as 
which is what i wanna get into as metabolic rate how much energy how much food if you like 
it need each day to stay alive how did the two thousand food calories roughly speaking that we need 
does that scale from the smallest just stay with mammals the smallest mammal to the blue whale is there 
regularity that was the thing that i also learned about that these scaling laws and in particular the scaling 
metabolic rate had already been discovered people had collected well a man named max kleiber originally had collected this 
the and discovered an extraordinary regularity that it was incredibly simple scaling law which we call a power law 
it in english and then say and translate it gw so the scaling law is as a function of 
it goes to the threequarters power of its mass which sc what goes as the gw sorry the metabolic 
sc the metabolic rate so your heart gw no just how much food you need each day stay with 
first that scales with the threequarters power of mass the way you say it mathematically threequarters power of mass 
that you cube the mass the three and the quarter means you take the square root twice so a 
bizarre law from that viewpoint sc well at least saying that bigger things need more food but less per 
gw less per gram and systematically so the thing that surprised me was that it was so simple mathematically 
and also that there was a law anyway that any law should exist because we have this notion that 
selection invokes the idea of random processes within an environment and that any characteristic of an organism whatever it 
including the organism itself but also the nature of its cells the nature of its genes have a unique 
history and historically contingent it depends on happened in the past sc i mean biologists love to show us 
diversity of life with all these different things gw absolutely their big thing darwin their big thing and why 
often argue physics and mathematics has actually nothing to do with biology because there any simple things like that 
here was a law about maybe the most fundamental quantity in biology how much food do you need to 
alive and it was showing extreme regularity and whereas as i say from a naive natural selection viewpoint you 
have expected if you plotted on a graph metabolic rate on the vertical axis versus size on the horizontal 
the points would be sort of all over the graph reflecting the historical contingency of an evolutionary history of 
organism sc yeah why two mammals of the same body mass have very different metabolisms because they had different 
that evolution gave them gw exactly so this was pretty amazing to me but what was even more amazing 
that if you looked at any physiological characteristic that could be measured or any life history events such as 
long you live how long you take to mature the rate at which you grow with all these kinds 
things they also had a very similar very simple regular behavior and as i say just to emphasize again 
marked contrast to the naivety that we have about natural selection furthermore and this was critical from a physicist 
what we call the exponent the threequarters in metabolic rate was repeated across all of these different characteristics sc 
totally different quantities gw for different quantities sc they are asking questions about it gw some as mundane if 
like is heart rate some as profound really as life span that we talked about earlier but things like 
length of your aorta something like that or the number of leaves on a tree as a function but 
i learnt and i was very fortunate at the time that a few years earlier four books had come 
at pretty much the same time summarizing all of this so there must be anywhere from fifty to one 
of selfscaling laws depending on what you wanna call them and it had been before the second world war 
had been an area because they were discovered in the it was an area of significant concerns so many 
biologists had spent time thinking about it huxley and thompson and jbs haldane and some of the big names 
midcentury biology but with the late and came the molecular revolution and the discovery of dna and the double 
and that completely changed everything and these questions which are to do with multicellular actually not just to do 
multicellular organisms but to do with sort of more macroscopic sc everyday life scale kind of behavior gw yes 
sort of swept under the rug and forgotten and everything turned to molecules and genes in particular genes so 
that was the paradigm we should be thinking about biology and in retrospect it sort of parallels a little 
physics that in my years as a high energy physicist i think that part of that culture was that 
we need to know is the fundamental laws and why the theory of everything was so important because once 
got the fundamental laws we can calculate anything and everything including all it is in some weird way is 
the crank for these equations and that will pop all these marvelous things sc and i think that very 
people said that explicitly nor would they even have defended it if you asked but there was some sort 
yes sc gw exactly sc that underlay what was important versus what was sort of a waste of time 
exactly so i think anybody ever said it and exactly right if anyone had said that people would have 
yes of course very those fundamental laws are crucial important and they will lead to all this but true 
will need to develop other techniques there been a very soft version but it was still there and it 
in the culture and also in the culture was in a certain sense again i did actually hear it 
that it was not very common was all the rest of those things those things were sc engineering yes 
you know as if that was sc not in a complimentary way gw yes as it was pejorative and 
was very much echoed goes back a long way of course to the famous statement of lord rutherford the 
of the atom the famous one science can be divided into two physics and stamp sc stamp collecting yes 
was always slightly embarrassed by that and then one of my caltech colleague has a poster with that quote 
his wall he was very proud right gw this was part of it so we know there but anyway 
going back to the medical revolution and the genomics what had evolved was a similar kind of arrogance i 
has evolved that that is everything so that we ended up not so long ago with this idea that 
was fantastic we should map the human genome which is phenomenal and a fantastic achievement but the hype about 
was once done sc engineering gw it sort of solved everything sc engineering after that gw engineering after that 
personalized medicine and all diseases and all syndromes are gonna be understood and solved and so on we are 
the santa fe institute and one of my first visits to the santa fe institute was by leroy hood 
was one of the initiators of the genome project and he was here talking about it and i listened 
it it was a very very good talk but he said this very explicitly and i was amazed that 
was giving that talk because he wanted to get computer scientists and people thinking about computer involved in doing 
engineering part laughter anyway and i thought at the time god this is really but we had that gw 
this area had migrated this area to do with organisms in particular and the more macroscopic thinking had migrated 
ecology so ecology and evolutionary and called evolutionary biology that became the home for some of this stuff and 
got involved because i had started working on this as i said on my own and as i thought 
it i had learnt about and discovered i discovered by reading i learned about all these marvelous scaling laws 
i said is i believe that there a theory out there that the biologists said that all been solved 
this is now whole end i discovered that there any it had just stopped literally stopped in its tracks 
i thought this is a marvelous problem to work on now in the context of physics have any relevance 
kind of thing sc can we have a theory that would help explain this observed phenomenon that has a 
and you fit the data gw yes can we derive can we construct a principled theory from which these 
can be derived and we can also make further predictions sc and just so we the people in audience 
the direction in which these things mentioned that larger animals live life at a slower pace gw yes sc 
hearts beat more slowly gw yes let me elaborate because i just said the scaling laws so let me 
you some other examples so heart rates for example decrease with size but they decrease in a very regular 
so that it is i said in the metabolic rate is you take you cube it and then take 
square root twice for heart rates they decrease according to taking the square root twice it sc the minus 
power gw the minus onefourth in mathematical language and so it is with many other things the radius of 
aorta scales with one that the threeeighths is the analogue to the one but you see the eighth has 
four in there sc you get fivesevenths gw you exactly so this number four permeated all of these scaling 
so i thought this is fantastic for physicist a true universality and what physicists concern themselves about at the 
level are there systematic kinds of phenomena and do they have kind of what we call universal behavior and 
there universal characteristics and here was one saying something astonishing that this unbelievably complex and diverse phenomena called life 
us is constrained by the number four sc yeah laughter gw i mean i sc magic gw this is 
magic where in the hell does this number come from so that was the state of mind i was 
when i started thinking about it and i and the first thing you think about is what is common 
realize that whatever the underlying mechanism is it must transcend the evolve design because true for plants trees true 
mammals true for birds insects and so forth sc in other words some happy place for an organism to 
and evolution gets you there you can take different gw sc but this is where you will end up 
exactly exactly exactly it can take many different paths and it gets manifested in different ways in the sense 
we have a beating heart and a respiratory system a tree in fact we are a bunch of tubes 
plumbing but a tree is a bunch of fiber bundles joined together and sprays out like electrical cable sprays 
so these are quite different engineered designs but they satisfy the same scaling laws so you ask yourself something 
to transcend that and then it take very long to think it through and realize that look the huge 
that an organism has is that made up of an enormous number of components particularly cells got some we 
ten trillion ten to the and they have to be sustained and serviced in a roughly speaking democratic and 
fashion and obvious what has happened developed networks and if you think in those terms you realize that you 
a bunch of networks everything from your as i said circulatoryrespiratory systems your renal system even your bones are 
big sc nervous system gw your nervous system your neuro system the very thing that you think of as 
the white and grey matter in your brain those are also just branching systems the synapses and neurons and 
are all networks sc so a network of course is not a particular tv station or like in tv 
laughter thinking gw very good so true thank you sc so i could draw a some dots on a 
board or a piece of paper and connect them with gw yes sc and that would be a network 
that would be a network sc thinking of a particular kind of gw yes sc branching network gw most 
these networks that not absolute but most of these networks are high hierarchical like your circulatory system a beating 
an aorta that comes down out and then it branches and continues to branch all the way down serving 
organs all the way down to the capillaries that feed cells so this branching network and most of the 
networks in our bodies have that kind of characteristic so i sort of had this idea that it must 
some universal features of networks there must well in the language of physics is a universality class of networks 
have this feature that have somewhere in them this one quarter this four sc they know about the number 
they know somehow sc what could that be gw so what could that be indeed so what i did 
was simply try to solve the question of does that circuitry system just to take that as a physics 
sc a simple warmup problem good gw a warm up it turned out to be quite complicated sc who 
have guessed gw who would have guessed and it was a wonderful challenge mathematicalphysics challenge which was quite frustrating 
times but i enjoyed immensely i could use all of the classical mathematical methods that been taught as a 
student and i used sc yes gw my career and they all came to bear on this and i 
solved it but i then in solving it i had to think is the principle what are the principles 
are constraining this sc just by solving it you mean constructing a mathematical model that gw that sorry that 
yes the sc what we know about the circulatory system gw what we know about our circulatory system sc 
a physicist means by solving this system right gw right sorry so mathematical sc yeah gw so you have 
write the mathematical equation for the blood flow through your vessels and complicated because a pulsatile flow being beaten 
the heart being boomboomboom and not only that it goes through a vessel and then that vessel sc yeah 
so some goes down one one down the other and so you got to deal with that and then 
bifurcates again or trifurcates even so you had to deal with all that and so i did all that 
and all kinds of formula you derive for that but you have to constrain it not some arbitrary network 
what i realized quite early on and it turned out i put together three generic principles but only in 
context of circulatory systems to begin with and then i realized later these were generalizable to all these networks 
they were the following the first is the network has to be what we call spacefilling it has to 
everywhere every cell in the body has to be supplied by blood has to be supplied by oxygen sc 
oxygen energy gw so therefore the terminal unit the capillary has to end near the cell so it can 
fed so called spacefilling sc and we know how many cells there are they fill the body gw suresure 
was which was something to do with natural selection as i thought about the scaling laws and our relationship 
other animals other mammals and that is that yes we look quite different but we obviously have a lot 
common but in particular as different mammals evolved natural selection kept certain things in variant it had certain building 
it did not reinvent cells in order to make a dog as distinct from an elephant it kept those 
building blocks so in terms of the network the cells were essentially the same but also with things like 
the end of the network the thing that feeds the cells so sc well natural selection is naturally very 
right it takes what you already gw absolutely sc and says can i improve things a little gw exactly 
just by tweaking what we already started it start and then initiate gw so you reinvent things a priori 
time and very parsimonious in that so that was the second idea the kind of invariance of terminal units 
the last was taking a real viewpoint and that is that something is being optimized physics operates almost entirely 
almost all levels particularly the fundamental level from optimization principles all our fundamental equations in motion are derivable from 
things we call the action or whatever sc if a beam of light goes from one one point he 
another it takes the shortest time gw the shortest path yes so this is fundamental to physics and so 
postulated hypothesized that our circulatory system in particular has evolved so as to minimize the amount of energy our 
have to do to pump blood through it that and i have it quite formulated at that time but 
ahead it was only later when i started a very intense collaboration with biologists and natural selection is what 
think about all the time and it was really this idea that the real reason for that from a 
selection viewpoint is that you minimize the amount of energy that is needed for the organism to stay alive 
live so that you can maximize the amount of energy you devote to reproduction and to raising of offspring 
to your darwinian fitness you maximize darwinian fitness by minimizing the amount of energy that you need to support 
sustain the system so this was one very specific case going back now to the circulatory system that you 
the amount of energy our hearts have to do to pump blood through it and so we have all 
equations sc so it you have three gw three principles and you know the dynamics and then a matter 
sc gw those equations with those constraints and very similar to what we were doing in field theory in 
energy physics the same conceptual framework that is anyway out of that popped to my absolute delight and amazement 
onequarter power now i have to interrupt that make it sounds very straightforward but it i struggled a great 
first of all trying to solve them and understand the biology and so on and a serendipitous event occurred 
that was that i got a call from the vice president of the santa fe institute who called me 
to say a biologist very wellknown biologist that is involved with the santa fe institute and he is very 
in getting a physicist involved in trying to understand scaling laws in and i sc you know gw and 
said believe i said the last almost year as a kind of hobby been working on that and i 
close to solving it but fantastic i need a he may need a physicist i need a biologist so 
to cut a very long story short that began an extraordinary collaboration with a man named jim brown who 
moved recently to the university of new mexico and was involved with the santa fe institute and he had 
marvelous student named brian lindquist who is himself now well known ecologist and a fantastic collaboration developed where we 
all this straight and it took us almost a year from then to get everything straight and it was 
huge commitment by the way because i was running high energy physics at los alamos sc oh right still 
had the day job yes gw i still had a day job i was running i was involved with 
theory group and we were we were still involved with many high energy experiments and i was the spokesperson 
the connection with the doe anyway and jim ran a big ecology lab out in the field and so 
and we both agreed to devote fridays to this at the santa fe institute and it was huge it 
an enormous commitment that came after a few meetings and we did and it and it required that actually 
we would meet we would meet here at the institute between am and am on a friday morning and 
would leave here about or in the afternoon and we would the three of us at the beginning we 
had the blackboard a lot of it was blackboard and a lot of it was just bullshit going back 
forth because i know the biology and how shall i put it they were mathematically challenged laughter gw so 
had to you know really things that we take so much for granted and really work hard at explaining 
and they were fantastic at explaining in very simple terms biological mechanisms and also very importantly what is important 
that in ones education that is something we often recognize is having a mentor who really guides you not 
teaching you but what is important and this is the way you should be thinking about this sc and 
those out there who are not professional scientists we should point out this idea of standing at the blackboard 
discussing things and learning things and having a feeling making real progress it get better than that gw no 
thank you sean i honestly it was fantastic and it get better than in a very curious way your 
are going back and forth and writing equations and then you realize they are completely wrong the idea is 
you were and you get depressed so many times depressed so you sit there and certainly with this i 
sit down and think am i involved with these guys they not able to write an and sure they 
the same way about me so all of that but part of it and often said sort of like 
marriage a good marriage gw that all comes with it and so it was a phenomenal period for me 
that collaboration lasted for about fifteen years and of course it evolved we got postdocs and other people joined 
and other senior people joined us we had a chemist had joined us another ecologist we had students from 
students from biology it was marvelous actually we created this body of work sc right but then i wanna 
topics too abruptly but it too long before you went from explaining all of the scaling laws in biology 
saying once i have my oh actually sorry we say where the four came from did we gw no 
i should tell you that sc gotta get that in there yes sorry gw so it is from the 
but put it in sort of simple you have to do all the calculations and you have to do 
it is what the four turns out to be is the three of the four is a reflection of 
fact that we live in threedimensional space the spacefilling that i talked about sc spacefilling networks gw if we 
if we lived in six dimensions it would that three would have been six and then a plus one 
so four is actually three plus one and the plus sc i knew that laughter gw very loosely speaking 
from the following those principles and in particular the optimization lead to these networks being fractallike selfsimilar that is 
repeat themselves as one goes down through the network sc the view looks very similar to the zoomed in 
gw exactly or if you cut a big branch of a tree and you take it away it looks 
a little tree and that self socalled selfsimilarity you can derive and that is fed by the optimization this 
kind of a constraint leads to that and it turns out one of the curious properties of fractal geometry 
it increases what we think of as dimensionality of the system and you can increase it and it increases 
maximally and that maximality happens to be one you go more than one and so biological organism natural selection 
taken advantage of fractal geometry to increase the dimensionality and increase its efficiency and its way of interfacing with 
the external environment it is sc otherwise large mammals would eat enormously more caloric input everyday to get through 
day gw absolutely sc but these networks solve the problem with maximum efficiency getting the oxygen through themselves gw 
the average exactly exactly so we are all manifestations of that sc and networks all over the place gw 
all over the place and indeed somewhere along the line it started to occur to me that this is 
paradigm for other problems and in particular social organizations and even more particular to cities and of course been 
long history of thinking of cities as kind of super organisms and we often use metaphors from biology metabolism 
city dna of a company and so on and so i i started at least thinking about it and 
thought why but again a serendipitous event came along laughter sc okay gw and that i was here at 
santa fe institute i was not part of the santa fe institute but i was here on this once 
week basis and i gave a colloquium one time on my biology work and in the audience were a 
of very good social scientists who came to me afterwards and said know so intrigued by this sure we 
use this to start understanding things about cities and other social and to cut a very long story short 
formed a new collaboration sc giving us the impression that all great science happens by accident because it just 
in your talks gw well mine does in a way mine does and i know i it i know 
accidents but i often think that any new idea that had i often feel not to do i know 
sounds weird but not much to do with me sc but i think it does sound weird because one 
your discoveries about cities is that they sort of provide the environment for these things to happen by letting 
interactions happen gw exactly sean i think that is what is happening to all of us and sort of 
unconscious part of the city sc yeah gw and it is so i often say i even said and 
i think have probably said it in many ways the city is our greatest invention because a machine that 
us together and facilitates and enhances social interaction and provides positive feedback mechanisms for enhancing that to create ideas 
innovate and to create wealth and certainly true that most of those ideas most of those conversations and interactions 
take place lead anywhere or to do with but amazingly that phenomenon occasionally leads to the theory of relativity 
to google or to microsoft or sc the santa fe institute gw the santa whatever but what the city 
it is that machine for doing that sc a friend of mine a theoretical physicist we were having a 
night conversation and he says the following he said you divide human history into the most recent years and 
the years before that there were a lot more people in prehistory there were a lot more people older 
than years ago but all the good ideas seem to be in the recent and we were wondering why 
was and there are hypothesis like they were too busy hunting and and in fact the data are that 
have lot of leisure time gw of time yes sc so in fact things like the city density gw 
the city is the mechanism by which we do this so anyway we formed a collaboration and unlike the 
where i was extremely fortunate that the scaling laws had already been put together developed the phenomenology so to 
had been organized in these four books that i mentioned earlier that had been published and by the way 
say it because these people who were quite senior people had worked on it earlier this was the end 
their careers molecular revolution genetics had taken over and they were kind of summarizing sc right gw and the 
thing about those was when i discovered that there was no theory they just showed all the stuff anyway 
cities not in that position what i learnt was that surprisingly no one had looked at the scaling of 
sc so you wanna know about how things like presumably energy use or roads or something like that change 
the city gets bigger and bigger gw exactly so you could i think the very first question we asked 
this was still an incipient collaboration it was with a man now very well known social physicist i know 
you call them these days works in social organizations came out of physics and ended up helping at the 
in zurich and a student but we worked together first was does the number of gas stations scale with 
very mundane kind of question sc but one would guess the number of people is proportional to the number 
gas stations they all need gas gw what you would have thought naively yes they all need gas so 
we looked at the data we discovered amazingly that it looked just like biology it was that it scaled 
a very systematic way following this same mathematical powerlaw scaling but the exponent the analog to the three quarters 
quarter powers i mentioned earlier that was not a quarter power it was meaning to put it in english 
if you doubled the size of a city instead of needing twice as many gas stations very roughly speaking 
only need so this marvelous economy of scale the bigger the city and the original paper only looked at 
european countries and they all expressed the same scaling law and somewhat later when the collaboration was more formed 
formalized and in particular two people brought onboard one was a physicist a very good physicist named luis bettencourt 
had been came out again came out of nuclear physics actually and a man named jose lobo who had 
associated with the santa fe institute was an urban economist gw he was at cornell at the time but 
were very good data analysts and one of the things they did was they looked at data from around 
globe just first gas stations and discovered the same scaling law everywhere but even more amazing was that if 
looked at any infrastructure at least the ones we could get data for like length of all the roads 
of electrical lines water lines blah blah blah they all had the same scaling with this this and that 
sort of amazing and it was just like biology except instead of kinda thing sc is that because cities 
not truly threedimensional space filling organisms gw well we wondered but yes and in fact i think yes from 
viewpoint the answer is yes the dimensionality plays a crucial role and ultimately does but i should say right 
front now i would oh so let me back off a second so the obvious thing is again even 
new york look like los angeles which look like chicago which look like santa fe all network systems all 
the same thing sc yeah gw so just as the whale look much like an elephant which look much 
a human being actually doing all the same things biologically and so in that sense not surprising they are 
versions of each other so it is that cities within a given urban system are indeed scaled versions of 
another but following in terms of the infrastructure a similar laws as biology but with a exponent of as 
say to do somewhat with their dimensionality they are more twodimensional obviously but also their network systems that was 
other point and clear is that like biology their networks their road networks electrical sc are they optimizing some 
of the heart rate gw the question what are they optimizing and how much have they optimized so in 
of those networks i believe that in many ways those networks are optimizing things like time to get from 
sc okay gw and distances you want to supply things as directly as possible but you still gotta do 
in a network way because you got to supply sc but is it safe to say we yet have 
development of theory for cities that we have for organisms gw no so we so one of the things 
we can make if we make certain generic assumptions that are quite analogous to the ones in biology but 
ones to do with something that i mentioned yet which distinguishes social systems in particular cities from biology and 
is social networks sc right gw and this is the most important thing and is to do with what 
talked about before that cities are there to enhance social networking and it is the structure of social networks 
are being reflected in the socioeconomic quantities and if you measure socioeconomic quantities we find something we see in 
and that is a reflection of this positive feedback loop that occurs in social interactions and that is laughter 
the bigger we sc your social network is calling gw it is indeed the bigger we are the more 
have per capita rather than the bigger we are the less per capita which dominates biology sc so our 
rate slows down as we have more mass gw right sc but i just love the fact that as 
move into the city the pace of life increases gw pace of life sc we literally walk faster gw 
so everything goes backwards in biology sc yeah gw instead of as i said the bigger you are the 
per capita the bigger you are the more per capita the higher the wages per capita sc the more 
the rent gw so and the rent obviously all these things and the higher the amount of construction per 
goes up the number of patents produced per capita the innovation of the city increases the amount of crime 
per capita the the number of aids cases increases per capita all following the same systematic scaling law of 
increase by about with every doubling so it follows again the same mathematical power law scaling the exponent now 
now bigger than one the and called super linear sc is it possible that the physical proximity afforded by 
will some day be replaced by networks that are virtual that are online that see their usefulness gw well 
very interesting question i think replaced so when i first did this work i thought exactly along those lines 
then i thought you know already had that because the invention of the telephone already did that it already 
something virtual even though we know there are lines going sc yeah gw gone one step further than that 
course but you know what it did was that it contracted time up until that point you could only 
an interaction with no time delay if you were facetoface otherwise you had to wait hours days and in 
case months and suddenly you could have the equivalent of to facetoface right there in your home and that 
a profound influence so i think bigger than the it revolution which has taken it truly virtual because out 
in cyberspace and so forth and so i would say that the it revolution has done what the telephone 
by the way things like the steam engine did because by the way the railroad did something sort of 
the telephone it contracted space sc it shrunk the world gw shrunk the world because until the railroad most 
move more than ten to twenty miles from their home in their entire life sc i read from you 
matter what the transportation system is people have an average commute time of an hour a gw yes about 
hour yes a standard number that urban geographers use sc is that a half an hour each way gw 
half an hour each way sc okay yeah that actually works gw yeah each way been expanded to an 
now in some places sc okay we got patient gw but yes so the size of a city it 
being suggested the traditional size of a city typically this is very handwaving it is given by the how 
you can move in actually now one hour by whatever the transport is so it just expanded with the 
sc right and now not shy about having policy recommendations on the basis of this point of view right 
choices about how to live how to govern ourselves what to do for our infrastructure what should we learn 
these insights gw well i have no i have actually been i interact quite a lot with the policy 
and the urban geographers and urban economists but very loathe to make explicit policy decisions or recommendations other than 
following this passionate about the urban planning in particular has a very checkered history it is operated urban planning 
in terms of building new developments enlarging cities mitigating problems building new cities roughly speaking is worked by rule 
thumb this is what done in the past this is what we do very truly phenomenological sc not what 
make a theoretical physicist happy gw no this is where we did it and learnt that not just reading 
literature but given talks at big conferences and people have come up to me and said i run a 
and building a small town of people and i had no idea any of this existed and we the 
we well we should have a park exaggerating a little sc a little bit gw but what it is 
very much rules of thumb and it is no accident that almost all synthetic cities have been failures brasilia 
even washington dc taken a long time for washington dc to become a real city and so on islamabad 
been essential disasters and seeing it repeated tragically i think in china because china has this pressure to build 
hundred new cities in the next twentyfive years and just building them willynilly just buildings and solars and gonna 
horrible repercussions and is already actually sc well very sad because we are running out of time but circle 
to where we started because you mentioned this question i know whether a responsibility or at least the question 
how scientists relate to the usefulness of what they do gw oh very good very good sc some of 
myself included have rarely done a piece of science that directly improves the life of anyone but me and 
friends and other fans of theoretical physics and cosmology other scientists of course have changed the world in dramatic 
how should we think about this gw yes of course like you most of my career as i said 
in high energy physics and never done a practical thing in my life however and i had a faith 
it is a faith that understanding more and more deeply eventually has profound implications not just for its own 
but actually propagates through and in some way we fully understand but in some diffusive way actually influences the 
we live in gw and so let me give you an example that influenced me tremendously when i was 
graduate student so when i was a graduate student a terrible experimentalist i was terrible i almost failed every 
both as an undergraduate and graduate student getting a degree because i do the bloody experiments but i always 
thing i did feel was that physics was sort of at some level an experimental science because its power 
you can not only observe but you can test and an iterative scientific methodology and so i thought be 
to go into a lab and really see how it all and at that time i was a graduate 
at stanford a man named arthur schawlow who joined the faculty been at bell labs and was the coinventor 
the laser he won the nobel prize for it a little bit later and he was just setting up 
lab and i was his third graduate student and i joined him and i told him exactly what i 
said but like to do it and see and i said stay and be anyway i was a terrible 
and i and art by the way was a terrible theorist and so it was very good because i 
sort of the house theorist and i would explain papers the theory papers to him gw so we had 
nice symbiotic relationship but one day at night in the lab art had in his lab because we had 
biggest laser in the world actually and i was talking to him about being a scientist and i wanna 
a scientist and i said i do high energy physics and so useless and you and you are at 
labs at least and i said this now doing work that is obviously i laughter gw you know i 
this got nothing to do with anything obviously sc right lasers gw marvelous marvelous atomic physics resurrecting atomic physics 
the ashes and marvelous but obviously got nothing to do with anything and he said completely he i looked 
said is gonna revolutionize the world he said know we always show when we have visitors to the lab 
take this big block of wood and we fire the laser we drill a hole through it do you 
that gonna have lasers powerful enough that be able to drill holes through steel not only that be able 
cut steel to extraordinary accuracy and this is gonna revolutionize the entire gw he was completely wrong it did 
revolutionize the planet it did revolutionize a teeny bit of industry of course and allowed laser surgery but it 
not he was wrong but he was also right that it did inventing the laser revolutionized in a serendipitous 
a nonpredictable way and that is the nature of course of basic research we have no idea you know 
in the hell knows it could well i wanna even speculate but it does so that influenced me tremendously 
i mean like to think that this influence propagates forward but i do worry that i just have a 
for thinking that gw but then the second event and that was much later so i was a postdoc 
cornell and i got to know a man named robert wilson who was an extraordinary man and he became 
of fermilab which was at that period the biggest accelerator before we had the lhc and so on and 
had to go through some rough times in congress being attacked for exactly this question and there is a 
occasion when he was being strongly attacked about the role of this kind of research and the question came 
a senator saying know mr wilson this is all wonderful stuff you know marvelous to know these laws but 
is it got to do with for example he said has it got to do with the defense of 
country you know coming from the department of energy where we make bombs and so on what the hell 
learning about these elementary particles and the symmetries and all the things told us about got to do with 
defense of the gw and bob wilson said i have absolutely no idea how this will help the defense 
the united states but it will make the united states worth and there was spontaneous laughter gw and that 
spirit in which we do this sc i think right i think as you know as well as anyone 
average human being has three billion heart beats and about what gonna do with them you know fun to 
to extend our lives but also living our lives and discovering new things about the universe one of the 
ways we can spend that gw and what being a human being is and i think that is the 
level to which we should all attain actually we should all try to aspire to in someway or another 
you know science has that characteristic and working on problems that seem to have no perceived influence on the 
around us is one of the things that should be supported and one of the sad things that has 
in the intervening years is more and more the funding agencies are focusing on you know have you done 
me lately and how is this gonna help sc well hopefully our little podcast can do a tiny bits 
help improve the laughter gw well i hope so because i mean ironic that ended up working on things 
could be perceived as being very practical sc i know i thought it gw and i hope have us 
but with a big picture world view of thinking about these systems sc well geoffrey west thank you so 
for being on the podcast gw thank you sean for having me thanks for the conversation music informative insightfulbrilliant 
chromosomebeads on a stringstring theory scaling laws i heard about these scaling laws of networks and found this episode 
fascinating love the podcast i love these podcasts it exposes sean wider interest in the world of toplevel knowledge 
would like to hear more competitive interaction say between carroll and academic theologians for example if that is not 
contradiction in terms the more competitive the better rather that repeated confirmation of what the rational already accept does 
paradigm through which you view life evolved or designed intelligently have any real bearing on whether you expect certain 
solutions regarding parameter ratios in organisms this one was my favourite out of the eight recorded so far i 
it was at least two hours comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers
