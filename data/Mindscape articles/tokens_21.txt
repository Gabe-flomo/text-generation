he was six months old click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape 
your host sean carroll and i was recently reading over the patreon page for mindscape and i noticed that 
very first sentence in the description says a scientist author and now a so think about that move the 
first way that introducing potential patreons patrons to the mindscape podcast is to talk about myself by giving myself 
right scientist author podcaster this is the move of identity of labeling ourselves as part of a larger group 
this idea of identity has become contentious in the modern world it probably was always contentious right what identities 
what is the role of identity in particular we have the idea of identity politics which arranges people on 
of a spectrum one spectrum that says if i am female or africanamerican or poor these are incredibly important 
about myself and politically it makes all the sense in the world to organize along those lines that i 
share my interests with other people who share that sc on the other side of the spectrum there is 
move that says should all be citizens of the world we should all be common human people we should 
our identities and try to put them aside for the greater and i know trying to say this in 
very unobjectionable way many many people rush to one of the ends of this spectrum and then caricature people 
the other end conversation is an attempt to move beyond these caricatures and take the idea of identity seriously 
the context of politics but also just in the context of how we live our lives how we think 
ourselves my guest is kwame anthony appiah who is a very distinguished philosopher and also someone who has a 
of identities that play important roles in the modern world he was born and raised in ghana he was 
in the uk in prestigious places like cambridge university he now lives in new york city he is gay 
biracial and most of all a philosopher these are all identities that are very very important written a wonderful 
on cosmopolitanism which is sort of the idea that we should in some sense try to look beyond our 
and be part of this bigger picture sc but he argues that that mean erasing our identities we have 
learn to live with our identities while acknowledging that to a large extent made up if you are black 
asian or white in the modern world this is a crucially important part of your identity if blackhaired or 
or redhaired that is a less important part for basically arbitrary reasons so what are the aspects of identity 
matter how can we use them to live together how do we construct them what are the stories we 
these are the topics going to be talking about in podcast remember you can get complete transcripts for everything 
we say here at the mindscape podcast just go to the webpage preposterousuniversecompodcast and at the end of the 
blog post be a little link that says here for the the whole transcript will be there so you 
actually search the entire webpage to find anything that has ever been talked about on the mindscape podcast and 
that go music sc kwame anthony appiah welcome to the mindscape podcast kwame anthony appiah delighted to be talking 
you sc going to start with an anecdote which will seem a little bit out of left field but 
will connect back into what talking about my wife and i were watching castle rock which is a tv 
based on stephen stories and a mother and daughter characters this season who share this story about the laughing 
and that seemed vaguely familiar to me but i know it so i went of course online and i 
it so the laughing place comes from the brer rabbit stories the brer rabbit stories is familiar to many 
through uncle remus and things like that so of course on wikipedia and i click on brer rabbit to 
my memory about those stories it turns out i had never known this brer rabbit sort of as a 
figure his stories were translated from west africa where they were stories of anansi the spider and so i 
on anansi the spider who is also on a different tv show these days on american gods a neil 
tv show and reading about anansi the spider and his exploits when i see that one of the major 
works about anansi the spider or one of the major collections was compiled by peggy appiah who i believe 
your mother is that right ka she was my mother yes yes yeah so she collected actually she also 
anansi stories believe it or not sc okay yeah you mean that she had written ka well she the 
volume was called tales of an ashanti father and my father being ashanti grew up with anansi stories which 
still very much known and he told some of them to us and she was listening and she thought 
were kind of cool so she started writing them down and adapting them in the way you do when 
write things and so so her first books were stories based on anansi stories and one of them i 
did one of them have the word anansi in the title i remember but as i say the first 
called tales of an ashanti father and so that was one kind of tradition that she collected but the 
things she collected were these things that are called gold weights which are not made of gold but used 
weighing gold and they are made of brass and some of them are figurative and some of them have 
designs on them ka and actually you can tell roughly when they were made by what kinds of designs 
have because depending on whether they were trading with europeans or with arabs they have different weighting systems and 
on full of interesting information about culture but she started collecting those she was trained as an artist she 
to art school and became one of the experts on them and she would of course what she did 
she took them to people often in villages and asked them to talk about them and they way they 
about them often was by telling proverbs many of which are in fact the taglines of anansi stories so 
started collecting proverbs and we published translations of proverbs that she collected in my language a bilingual edition of 
proverbs with glosses which of course took a very long time to do sc i can imagine yeah but 
struck me as so appropriate because we wanted to talk today about identity and cosmopolitanism and one of the 
heard you say is how stories help feed into the identity of a people and also questions of appropriation 
translation and for that matter the fact that the anansi stories to the extent that they were converted into 
rabbit stories were then appropriated by walt disney for that movie the song of the south which gave you 
impression that being a slave was a wonderful happy thing and so a lot of issues that really just 
right out of that single anecdote i think ka yes yes no i think the anansi stories part of 
wider genre of trickster stories which include things like the loki in the norse sagas and to some extent 
of the characters in the greek mythology but there are very important ones in west africa the other large 
of tradition is yoruba tradition and eshu the trickster god there is a very important figure in their mythology 
theology and interesting about them in all these traditional cultures i mean in a way you could say that 
is the kind of trickster figure the role sc he annoyed everybody right everyone was annoyed at ulysses ka 
a hero sort of but annoying in various ways the idea that the trickster is very powerful and important 
a very widespread crosscultural notion and anansi stories are not all about anansi anansesem which is the word just 
just mean anansi or it means anansi things or anansi words is the generic term for all folk tales 
are there are anansi stories in which anansi occur but a lot of them are about him and a 
trickster and so the idea that you respect maybe a little bit fear but also admire the trickster figure 
a central thing that brought up with if brought up with these stories sc well is it too much 
think that the kinds of let me ask it as a question how much do the kinds of stories 
different communities and groups of people lean on either reflect who they are or shape who they become is 
an even an answerable question ka well i think those kinds of questions of causality are rather hard to 
out but reflect sure i mean i and i think it must be the case that if brought up 
with these stories in which anansi is a focus and admired it must suggest something to you about what 
my in english in ghana called trickishness he was very trickish people say i think it must do and 
and certainly you know when we think about the role of the novel in shaping the moral climate of 
as it surely must have as also reflected them you know it these stories provide a way of thinking 
questions that arise for you the questions about i mean in the century questions about marriage and property they 
real questions for the kind of people that read trollope novels ka people were making decisions all the time 
that sort of thing and to have stories in which it works out or it work out stories that 
teach the idea that love is tremendously important and that all the marriage stuff that is also important but 
propertyrelated reasons can get in the way of this other important thing i mean i think part of a 
history that changes the character of marriage eventually and john stuart mill on the wall there chuckle sc there 
is looking rather stern right ka he is looking very stern sc oh but david hume behind him i 
okay ka yes yes yes discussions of the connection between marriage and equality in on the subjection of women 
of that depends upon the longer history of the growth of ideas about romantic love and the importance of 
love and the idea of companionship in marriage as opposed to as it were coparenting as being the main 
you do and the bringing together of individuals rather than of families being the main thing doing all of 
surely must have been affected by people reading the novels of romance and antiromance i think the stories that 
read and the stories that they hear as growing up the stories that told must have a big impact 
i think yeah why important to read to children and to tell them stories if you read sc well 
think this is reflecting bigger issues right i mean you need get some of the bigger issues on the 
words like identity are very charged these days and different senses of identity right or racial identity or national 
and so forth do you have a simple way of just thinking about what the word identity means or 
used these days ka that depends on what you mean by simple sc you need be too simple this 
like to get a little bitty ka i think first of all very important that this way of using 
word identity is an entirely postsecond world war phenomenon a modern phenomenon people did not use the word identity 
very hard to find a word that does the same job before the idea that race and gender and 
and religion are all things of the same kind which i mean so used to that idea that you 
to step back from everything is that really one of sc well actually i want to go over that 
quickly because really worth pointing out identity before second world war would have just been more individual like who 
specifically are ka yes i mean they have used the word identity they would have used words like self 
individual i mean lots of language for talking about some of a group member groups and so on also 
though ethnicity is a relatively modern word too words like that sc so not only our identity is constructed 
identity as an idea was very constructed ka identity was constructed constructed is the idea that all of these 
the same and now my answer to the question why are they all the same well all the same 
these because they all have the following three properties one the involve labeling and without the labeling it work 
they mean something to the bearers of the label so that they say to themselves they get up in 
morning and they do things because they are men or because black or because white or because catholic and 
other people do things to them because of the labels the basic structure of identity labeling and one other 
that should be said as it were as part of the basic theory as well i think which is 
all of these things tend to be contested ka exactly who are the men and who are the women 
now noticed is not as obvious as people have taken it to be and now we have contests about 
what it means to me to be black or gay or whatever is i may not be entirely clear 
that other people may have views about what it means to me that i share other people may tell 
that not being black enough or that letting down the gay community or sc not being gay in the 
way ka yeah not being gay in the right way and also huge obviously disagreement about sometimes if at 
we should take notice of identities when interacting with them but if we should how should we some a 
which i noticed when i came to this country which is that nonwhite people in small towns who know 
other and i was always one of them they know me will often just greet you sc already in 
club ka just say hello and the white people not hostile they just think appropriate to talk to a 
sc every stranger on the street ka every stranger on the street is that appropriate people can think kinda 
all as it turns out i know almost nothing of the culture of the people who i mean i 
now but i then know very much about the culture of the people who were greeting me and who 
whether i wanted to be greeted as it were they know anything about how grumpy i might be sc 
seems mostly sweet ka it seems sweet but notice that if white people made a habit of doing this 
a mixed race town people might begin to think that that was a bad thing now something to do 
the fact that white people are going to be a majority and if they were a minority in a 
town again we might think that not so surprising even given the background of racism and the fact that 
crossracial relations is probably a thing that in this country we ought to care about doing more than we 
sc but many cities have expat communities right ka yes yes sc where foreigners or strangers stick together in 
ways ka yes and in fact one interesting thing for americans i think is that when americans go abroad 
who are very conscious of the things that divide them from each other when home come to spend time 
and also become commonly defensive of things that they might well criticize when back home you know this an 
point about the contextual character of what identities do for us it depends on what the background is sc 
and i like your definition because it highlights the extent to which the identity is not simply from within 
so shaped by how we interact with the rest of the world and how they interact with us in 
sometimes identities are sort of forged by common enemies in some way ka yes yes i mean charles taylor 
that dialogical i like that word because if part of what that means is that if going to change 
or shift them around got to get everybody on board and it may be that you might have a 
that the views about how things how a certain identity should work should be given extra weight but in 
identity is a part of a system of identities and so everybody has a stake in it you change 
it means to be a woman and just leave what it is to be a man completely freefloatingly independently 
sc when you draw a boundary it separates two things ka yes it separates two things and so the 
about where the boundary lies are obviously required as it were the consent of all parties or at least 
going to be settled if you can get the consent of all parties and certainly the meanings of these 
there are socially available meanings when you know if a parent and you have a male child and a 
child the way in which their gender identities are available to them is going to depend on more than 
what you think and more than what they come to think going to depend on how people in the 
think about those things and different people in the world may think differently very much a matter i think 
it is as something that inevitably involves negotiation and perhaps compromise because a change in the system that is 
good for some people maybe may actually take something away from other people ka now it may be as 
the case of the changes in the gender system produced by the kind of feminism that goes back to 
stuart mill and mary wollstonecraft those changes took away some things some privileges from men and a jolly good 
too i mean so sometimes taken away from people they entitled to but still they lost something and so 
had to to make it really work you had to get them on board and i think this is 
that i feel is a little bit missing in the discussions about trans issues is the recognition that it 
an issue for cis people as well as trans people and that though the system needs to be changed 
ways that will allow trans people better lives they do it without bringing the rest of us along and 
means they have to make arguments they just declare things and they have to help us understand what it 
they want not just be annoyed with us for not understanding it and so on ka now i mean 
agree with the main thrust of what up to but i think sometimes people behave as if the resistance 
comes to what they want it may be unreasonable but it comes from a place of people genuinely having 
stake in the cistrans system and therefore having i think the right to participate in trying to understand going 
sc well and this is one of the issues that inevitably comes up when one such group one such 
has been historically discriminated against there are things that they want and a little bit impatient and one can 
them for being impatient right ka no no they should be in a hurry sc maybe they want to 
and listen to detailed arguments one way or the other or even let me put it even more strongly 
that they can see what one person sees as a dispassionate philosophical argument one way or the other as 
attack on who they are ka yes and they do and it may be but what i was arguing 
suppose is that you always get what you want sc yeah no i agree yeah ka and that you 
look a very interesting thing i think young people people in their teens and today may have a hard 
understanding why lesbian and gay people in the and and maybe before were not just mad at their families 
not just angry with them all the time and kind of saying it or leave it this is who 
but that is what happened people negotiated with their families and when their families reacted badly to coming out 
stomp out of the room and leave they stuck around and well this is a sort of an average 
there are lots of stories away from the mode but i think what works it turns out insisting immediately 
getting your rights even though they are your rights what works is a little bit of patience and working 
people to get them to see what what may be difficult for them to see and is too easy 
for you to see because you are living it living a trans identity sc clear to you ka clear 
you going on i think another thing to be said is that the negotiation just with cis people not 
if all trans people have the same views about sc not right or ka just any more than gay 
or black or white people or anybody catholics people have disagreements within the tribe and again you can declare 
to be doing the wrong thing as far as the tribe goes but that the way of persuading anybody 
stipulating that misbehaving and that black people do that or gay people do that or whatever or that letting 
the tribe so i think that dialogical is a good word charles says if we see them as a 
with other people and if we see that everybody has a stake in it even if the stakes are 
bigger for some people than others still everybody has a stake because a system of identities and the meaning 
the identities like all meanings is a common possession like the meanings of words you simply like humpty sc 
just declare a word to mean something sc right ka if you want a word to mean something or 
you want to shift the sense of a word going to have to work with people and they may 
may not go along sc well an excellent example very contemporary but i like in your recent book the 
that bind was that your most recent book ka yeah sc you write a lot of books laughter so 
have trouble keeping up sometimes and the allusion in the title is to the fact that in some sense 
is a lie or at least something we make up a story but they do bind us together and 
do a wonderful job sort of going through different modalities of what identity is so maybe get that on 
table as some examples we can draw on race is the most obvious one in the world and very 
that this idea that the word identity just used before in this sense but certainly the idea of racial 
was used and you tell this wonderful story of this philosopher who was at a time i guess before 
current versions of racial identity were quite congealed ka yes and he was born in what is now ghana 
i grew up but ended up as a professor of philosophy in germany and a bit unclear under what 
he got there but because it looks like he was a gift sc he literally was a gift ka 
was literally given to this german ducal family sc but is that the kind of thing that would have 
to white children also ka no no so some unclarity about whether he was technically a slave and the 
to which his own family sort of agreed to all this but we know that his brother was enslaved 
sent to suriname in the dutch west indies sc when did the slave trade start sorry that my ignorance 
showing ka well it starts in the century but it really reaches its peak a little bit after the 
that amo was taken from ghana in the century i suppose this is the transatlantic slave trade there were 
trades all over the world of course and this is sort of early enlightenment and these are the people 
had leibniz as their librarian this ducal family sc yeah there were some intellectual heavyweights floating around ka a 
of intellectual stuff going around and they did an experiment they he was made the godson of two dukes 
two of the children of the duke and so he was called anton wilhelm after his godparents anton and 
chuckle and he got the education they got now they going to go become academics they were going to 
become aristocrats but that meant he ended up with a law degree and a philosophy degree and then teaching 
made a living eventually as a teacher of philosophy and was apparently wellrespected and he wrote an unfortunately lost 
unfortunately lost book because a book about the law of slavery and love to sc it would have been 
what an century african become a german thought about the law of slavery and we know a little bit 
the argument of it a lot in the enlightenment a lot of books got brief summaries in encyclopedias and 
on so we know something about what he argued it been wonderful to have the whole thing but we 
have a textbook of philosophy which is actually rather good and contains in particular some very good arguments i 
against dualism now some people are using those arguments if teaching historical courses to talk about some of these 
sc sorry i got to pause on that because also i am an anticartesian dualist and my favorite arguments 
his dualism back in those days come from princess elisabeth of ka oh good yes sc another sort of 
of an identity which was not given she could not have become a philosophy professor i suppose at that 
ka no no yes sc and i wonder if any connection between slightly othered identities and rejecting cartesian dualism 
just made that up ka no a good idea and i will pass it on to colleagues who work 
that area because as i say both elisabeth and amo are now taught in in a way that they 
when i was in college people knew about her but you think in an introductory course or even in 
advanced course you think it was important to address her arguments anyway part of the experiment the experiment doing 
part of the experiment is can someone like this achieve intellectual eminence okay hypothesis proved he can sc and 
the idea that he was a member of a certain kind of person that was not us that ka 
it what is the kind of person that he was and the only thing i think i want to 
about that is because a complicated issue is that that issue was being settled about then that the idea 
how race was going to work at least in the context of relations between europeans and africans was being 
about then it was unsettled and in a way people who quoted amo as an example later on including 
abbé grégoire at that time of the french revolution really part of what he was used to argue was 
know pretty much like us and so this idea that this is a great cleavage in the human species 
so important but by the end of the sc by david time sadly looking at the picture of david 
there not his finest moment ka hume says about i think francis williams who was a jamaican poet that 
have been any good because black and kant says similar things though he reversed himself eventually because despite his 
kant was actually quite responsive to actual evidence when people like herder pointed out to him that he was 
about these things he thought about it and changed his mind the idea that there were i mean again 
new idea is that the natural history of man which is not yet biology but something a bit before 
answers the question of the kinds of man that there are kinds of man is obviously an ancient idea 
just have to read the beginning of the iliad to see lots of different kinds of greeks and also 
and trojans these are different kinds of people and in the background the persians who were another kind of 
and the ethiopians who were another kind of people the gods are off feasting with the blameless ethiopians at 
beginning of the iliad ka new is the idea that what we can think of as a kind of 
account of these things because the standard account in christian europe until then of the kinds of man was 
biblical account the descendants of noah ham shem japheth shem for the semites ham for the hamites and japheth 
the japhetites that is europeans essentially that was the idea now and of course the biblical scheme has a 
which is that it know about india or china sc it has a bunch of problems sure yeah ka 
so it lacks full completeness and so the idea that well we should go looking and this is a 
of a study and remember this is the century of when it was linnaeus who called us homo sapiens 
gave us a genus and a species and that idea again is part of the protoscientific stuff in the 
the science of biology really grows up the word biology was actually coined in one thousand eight hundred in 
and by the end of the century actually by the beginning of the century the account in terms of 
is beginning we think of mendel as having invented the basic ideas of genetics and he did well i 
earliest person we know that had did experiments testing hypotheses about genetic stuff but his work was published but 
sc did not make it big yeah ka did not make it big and so it was really morgan 
drosophila guy in the early century the first nobel laureate in medicine i think who really got genetics out 
and the word genetics gets coined and so on once you have a picture of how biological inheritance works 
you can immediately see that because particular to the idea that just one thing being transmitted the race look 
easy to maintain and already by just after the invention of genetics we du bois who has degrees from 
university of berlin he has qualifications from the university of berlin and harvard and so on a highly educated 
and historian and philosopher is saying this shows that this old way of thinking is not biological got a 
of inheritance but it map into the biology that we thought we had for race sc i mean very 
because we see the concept of the different races growing up and science is coming on the scene contemporaneously 
immediately put to work ka yes yes sc but never a perfect fit it never necessarily does what you 
it to do and hard to objectively follow what the science is trying to tell you when you have 
preconceived ideas ka right i think in natural history it was a perfectly reasonable hypothesis that there were distinct 
of human beings as there are distinct varieties of crows sc certainly demographical differences between people ka right and 
these were inherited was a reasonable hypothesis though interestingly enough the distinction between biological and nonbiological inheritance really depends 
having a genetic theory until you have a genetic theory the very idea of a distinction between different ways 
transmitting things between the generations is not really very well theoretically articulated and you see that in the characterization 
the races in the late century and into the century often things that we would think of as obviously 
like beards get sc oh really okay ka as part of the story and so the typical laplander thought 
as one of the minor races as it were is either going to be bearded or not i actually 
what the answer is to that you need the new science of biology which is developed in the century 
which develops genetics in the early century to get a clear grip on what the question is until then 
entirely clear what the question is as i said there have been kinds of people all along there were 
and ethiopians and persians and hebrews and philistines and so on new is the idea that first that this 
a scientific question and then that the right science is a science now called biology which is a very 
thing because it puts the question into the hands of the scientists who are also supposed to be classifying 
the other organisms ka it takes it away from as it were the distinctively human sciences anthropology say though 
was very preoccupied with nonhuman animals too in the beginning especially the other primates but a question that gets 
as the science is going along and as often happens in the sciences there are people who are just 
to get it right and then there are people who having an eye to what the concept is doing 
the world are trying to bring those things sc that has not gone away that tension within science right 
and i think that one of this is a sort of philosophy of science point i suppose but one 
the reasons why really important to have people of different identities doing science or any intellectual activity is because 
stakes for people are different and unfortunately or fortunately or unfortunately our biases which we do not have strong 
control of are affected by what the stakes are for us if you think about how many silly things 
said by about women by a century male scientist who was studying women in various ways including for example 
invention of hysteria as a psychiatric condition it would have been much better if been some women around who 
said a minute going to test going to push that hypothesis going to test that hypothesis it seem very 
to people like and they even had to say that explicitly then but that would have gone on explicitly 
not ka i i mentioned du bois one of the important things of course that happens in the century 
the scientific discussion of these questions is that more people who are not of european christian ancestry get involved 
there are more africanamericans in sociology and through the century obviously more women as well also importantly because of 
way race gets taken up by the nazis and by european antisemitism because remember hostility to the jews preexists 
idea that a race in the modern sense it goes back to medieval antijudaism because of that the presence 
significant numbers of jewish scientists i think in the life and social sciences as well as of course in 
natural sciences generally was an important brake on some of the ways this was going and produced so that 
of the big statements on race that were organized by people like unesco some of the leading scientists involved 
real scientists and i think contingent because again the stakes are different for different people sc very hard certainly 
race and gender in science when people try to talk about who has abilities and who people are really 
at separating what they want to be true from what is true on both sides ka yes sc sure 
could talk about race for many hours and people have but maybe we could contrast it with national identity 
is certainly another very very strong kind of identity and which seems a priori a totally different kind of 
right ka yes i think they get conflated of course i just mentioned the nazis their form of nationalism 
a nationalism about the german race the german people understood as a race the volk as race sc were 
very explicitly genetic about that ka yeah why they did those things which they called experiments in the concentration 
they were looking for biologicallybased differences between real germans and jews gypsies the few poor black people who got 
up in that system and so on so they can get all muddled together and what is certainly true 
that modern european nationalism which is essentially the form of nationalism that went global because of the role of 
empires in spreading these ideas though affected by things in other places but the core ideas start out in 
and they start out essentially i think from an intellectual point of view with german intellectuals people like herder 
gottfried herder and so his form of nationalism is tied to the idea of a people a volk sc 
ka herder yeah and that goes into hegel and hegel is a big wheel in all of this stuff 
the idea that you should sort of map states into folks states into peoples sort of one of the 
ideas of century nationalism and odd is that the process begins the idea that people should be brought together 
a single state who are all german or slav or italian or french arises at a time when just 
far from the truth that you begin to remember how untrue it is germanspeaking peoples are scattered all over 
germany but other places as well sc so thinking here about the century ka yes in the century even 
the and in france say a third of the population i think speak french so the idea that there 
a natural group called the people who had a shared language culture and traditions and were a shared people 
increasingly gets down to the idea of a shared race because of the rise of biology in the century 
idea is sort of crazy faced with the reality of europe at the time sc italy is even worse 
italy is worse sc languages are very different from coast to coast ka lots of different languages very different 
even different sort of stereotypical looks the typical milanese is sort of descended from the same people as many 
europeans and the typical sardinian but anyway so nevertheless this idea grabs hold and the idea that peoples should 
into states and that we should create a nation state where the nation is both a political thing and 
natural people develops through the century and takes hold and the idea that some natural unity but maybe not 
natural unity of blood perhaps a natural unity created by shared history and common traditions have to be have 
be a racebased thing but anyway some shared thing and the point is any candidate that you give for 
shared thing going to be able to tell you a century story about how that really shared sc big 
ka lots and lots of exceptions sc but it speaks to the lure of the idea that it was 
a powerful force to create this ka and it meets an important need because going on from another point 
view in the century is the growth of powerful state capacities and those state capacities depend upon stateistics they 
upon gathering the numbers that states need in order to do the things they do so censuses grow up 
constitution has a census built into it in the late century but censuses get developed increasingly everywhere and states 
counting trees counting people counting rivers sc it does seem it always seems strange me the precious space in 
original constitution gave so much importance to the census such as the thing ka right right sc but i 
if making a people counting them really matters ka well and if going especially if going to be a 
people and going to be counting them later in elections you gotta know there sc there yeah ka because 
you have responsible elections you decide in or out for electoral purposes and also if you want to have 
equal sized constituencies voting districts you have to know how many people are where and all of that but 
are many many other reasons why states want to count people they need to know if you want to 
how much money will be raised by a tax you have to know how many people earn what so 
start collecting income statistics if you want to educate people you have know how many kids there are so 
have to and so on so there lots of reasons so the states are developing these capacities ka and 
the course of developing the capacities they have to count things and they have to count people and so 
of people become important not so they count men and women they just count people they count nationals and 
and stuff like that also they start increasing the count of different kinds of sick people people who are 
disabled for example they want to know how many of them there are and so on and that creates 
as well some of which become essentialized so what doing is in the rise of the nation state one 
the important things is defining the nation and very tempting to have an essentialist a story that says what 
germans german is some germanness in each german something the same in all of them right and the trouble 
that there going to be any such thing that distinguishes germans sc ka danes or serbians or the french 
men and women so i think nevertheless a very tempting thought notice and one of the fascinating things about 
idea is so the nation state is this idea of a people with a common something sometimes race but 
just culture and traditions who naturally should be brought together into a state now two things first what was 
going on was therefore exactly the opposite of that it was the rise of the state that was creating 
nation it the nation that was creating the states as a response and two that means that when this 
spreads around the world you can actually take a place like the gold coast colony which became ghana which 
eighty languages one hundred ethnic groups the counting of these things is a bit arbitrary you can take it 
turn them into ghanaians on a certain day in and you can do what has been going on everywhere 
you can make sc you can tell stories about what it means to be ghanaian ka you can tell 
that make ghanaians ghanaians and even ghanaians have to be reminded that in doing that the british put together 
of their colonies togo and ghana the thing now called togo is only part of what was german togoland 
british part the part that was given to the british under the league of nations mandate at the end 
the first world war when the german colonies were taken away from the germans voted to join to the 
country of ghana so it was as clear as anything in the world in some sense that what was 
on was the creation of a state sc nothing more constructive than that ka in plain view older than 
so i was there as it happened and my father who was a ghanaian patriot was perfectly aware of 
this he would have said the yes of course we have to work together as it were to become 
and why he thought that what he called tribalism was a very dangerous thing even though he was a 
member of his ethnic group he thought that in the state it was really important not to discriminate among 
peoples of ghana so what ghana has done and this project that has significantly succeeded is to create a 
of ghanaian identity but very hard as it is with all national identities to give a simple story about 
that means and as i said about all identities lots of contest about what it means and a contest 
in and out the boundaries sc which sort of will never end ka will never end and so precisely 
never going to end it is not a solution every time you find such a fight to say well 
these lot in one side and these lot in the other be no totally agreeable way of making the 
and as soon as done that within each of the sides start to be developing processes of differentiation so 
organization of african unity which became the african union has insisted all along with mostly success the main exception 
eritrea that we were not to shift the colonial boundaries that the idea of making more and more groups 
more and more people wanted it was not a good idea and it a good idea sc so go 
to the original ka no not going to work there are languages in africa if a nation is something 
a common language nine hundred countries right and not going to work sc yeah and the united states is 
little bit different than that ka yes sc right but not completely different so on the one hand to 
idea that the united states is not based on ethnicity but based on ideas values ideals and ideas on 
other hand plenty of people around today who think that it kind of is really based on ethnicity ka 
and that at the beginning i think crèvecœur and the letters of an american farmer or whatever called says 
new race of americans is being created using race in this century rather vague sense but he says being 
out of people of all parts of europe so he think that native americans are being made into this 
race and he think that the slaves are going to be and their free sc but he also think 
british people ka absolutely not no no given his name is crèvecœur that probably have been a good idea 
no no but they generally of course we have to remember that in the century people shaped as the 
of north america were by european ideas thought of the irish as a profoundly distinct and in fact inferior 
to the anglosaxon and norman descended peoples in other parts of the british isles that notion of racial thinking 
how nations develop is not just an american thing it happens in europe in france we have this as 
read asterix knows we have the idea of the gauls and the franks as it were these two races 
together the aristocratic franks and the peasanty gauls together make the great french nation ka anglosaxon peasants norman lords 
britain all nonsense in the details you can show that not what happened but these we started with stories 
sorts of stories play a huge role in shaping these things and novels like ivanhoe in england or all 
walter scott novels play a role in shaping ideas about what england and scotland and ireland and wales are 
in those things racial ideas play a central role people forget perhaps partly because a very long novel so 
many people read it anymore but one of the central issues in the novel is about a relationship between 
christian and a jewish girl a jewish woman and again the issue of their race is sort of central 
thinking about that as is the relationship between normans and saxons which is also a big racial thing sc 
how much do our current debates over say identity politics just to use the buzz word right i mean 
much of these are ways of framing other kinds of issues and how much of them really grow organically 
of these actual contours of identity as they grow through time ka i mean there are many ways in 
ethnic and religious identities and national identities intersect with issues that are just about resources if you look at 
collapse of the yugoslav state one thing going on is that ancient and pretty low key ethnic identities become 
key and because they get used to compete for as a rapidly diminishing cake the collapsing resources are disappearing 
fight for them for your family on your own and so you need and so you grab for whatever 
available and it is a grab bag because muslim turns out to be one of the categories that you 
bag and very different from serb and croat but nevertheless those are the ones that are there albanian the 
that are there and they get used ka one thing is that they can get used in what are 
competitions for resources and not that a natural tension between serbs and croats that if you organize the serbs 
croats to compete for resources there will be a competition between serbs and croats but if organize in some 
way catholics versus orthodox which they also did to some extent you get different boundaries in different groups so 
way i think one question is how much ethnic and racial categories are always to some extent covers for 
for resources i think always that even if what matters most to you about your identity as an africanamerican 
culture and traditions the black church music whatever it cannot but figure somewhat in your thinking that poverty in 
united states and the distribution of material resources is very strongly correlated with racial identities sc one of the 
that has come out in your discussion is the idea that these categories have implications for boots on the 
broadly speaking where the money goes who gets to vote who gets thrown in jail and things like that 
example the contemporary debate on reparations for slavery and if someone is africanamerican in the sense that they were 
in africa and moved to america they get reparations for slavery maybe but does it too much reify the 
do you think another ka well i think what so there is this group now forgetting what called american 
of slaves i think they call themselves who are making the point that in favor of reparations but they 
the reparations to go to haitians or nigerianamericans they want it to go to people who are descended sc 
though the extent to which blacks are discriminated against probably is not very much affected by the amount that 
ka not very sensitive not very sensitive sc ka no it i mean i think the whole business of 
to i myself think a coherent way of giving individualized reparations i just think that make sense a significant 
of the descendants of american slaves have passed now and so now white and also a very large proportion 
american descendants of slaves are the descendants of slave owners too so they should presumably be transferring money to 
i think the idea that we one thing to say that at the moment you can broadly agree on 
rough boundary between africanamericans and other americans but already the question of how you should think about people whose 
came here black people who came here in their own lifetimes or people whose recent recent descendants of recent 
families who come from places where there are black people how should we fit those into that so that 
sense not a sensible question so it have a sensible answer sc yeah ka i worry that the focus 
reparations which is also necessarily backwardlooking distracts us from forwardlooking concerns about making sure that everybody has an equal 
decent shot sc well good let me just dramatically simplify the world here by sketching out three different positions 
okay sc and then we can talk about them one position is the social justice warrior position which says 
there are certain identities certain groups of people who are just not treated fairly and we should go to 
efforts to fix that one way or the other there is a sort of a countervailing position this is 
going to sound unfair hard to me to say this but white male straight people who feel like the 
who are actually being picked upon today because they have anything to do with slavery or anything like that 
their economic situation very good and why should they be portrayed as the aggressors here sc and then another 
of people who think that the entire discussion is wrongheaded in the sense that we should just be people 
we should pretend that we see race and gender and things like that and the constant harping on these 
making things worse for everybody way too simplistic but does the kind of academic understanding of where identity comes 
and the role it plays help us adjudicate these battles ka i think important to well first of all 
someone is disadvantaged in our society correlates with some of these identities but by no means determined by them 
there are some very very badly off straight white men in this country and similarly there are i suppose 
by american standards and gay so there you are but i pretend to think that i am not rolling 
all kinds of privilege sc a nice office laughter ka a nice office i have a nice job i 
a lovely husband i have no reasonable complaints sc sorry but you probably have had some complaints over the 
of your career ka well people have said racist and homophobic things around me but i they in a 
to do anything to me those people so even so mostly what sc right but key right you could 
them bounce off in a way ka yes absolutely sc if you were less privileged you ka no no 
conscious of the ways in sc exactly ka just to be explicit about this obviously a dimension of class 
and the class privilege that i have in which is the book of the british aristocracy sc oh congratulations 
ka of my ancestors because of my ancestry and my uncle and greatuncle were kings in the town that 
grew up in so i grew up with enormous social privilege and that makes it very easy to just 
of water off a back about some of these things so i and extremely conscious that without that privilege 
say that the racial dimension of my identity was not a source of problems for me and a point 
what in the technical language would be called intersectionality a point about the fact that these identities come together 
different ways and the total package of your situation depends on all of them sc right and not only 
it depend on all of them it depends on all of them as a physicist would say nonlinearly ka 
sc not just the sum of all of them ka no sc it also how interacting strongly with each 
ka right right not just a vector sum something way more complicated than that so i have some sympathy 
you are a poor white man struggling to make a living in a postindustrial context sc the world is 
around you ka and the world is changing around you and the world seem terribly interested in helping you 
with the view that our society is not doing what it should for you and i was sympathetic with 
view before some of those people voted for donald trump and was already saying this sc and we still 
afterward even though we wish they voted for donald trump ka yes yes yes and still the case that 
sc a real argument a real problem ka problem in our society on the other hand understanding that there 
real needs there that these are our fellow citizens with real needs mean that i say that if racist 
or that if they think that because we have legal segregation anymore no problem for black people to complain 
that just seems to me you know very good reason to doubt that lots of evidence in labor economics 
example that just not true and i pretend to agree with them about that i think wrong about it 
i think they may well be wrong about some of the things they think about happened in gender as 
which they may not be happy about ka so i think we have so one set of issues we 
yes we should disaggregate we should be careful and we should pay attention to all the problems not impossible 
keep track of more than one problem and the problems of class in our society are very very serious 
they are of course they interact with racial questions but but the problems of the people at the bottom 
the money social capital and cultural capital hierarchies are real problems and the majority of those people are white 
black people are a minority in this country and even if you include hispanics who are a significant minority 
more than blacks larger in numbers still the case that some of the most most of the serious problems 
the bottom are significantly faced by white people as well ka so when people complain about identity politics having 
us from class politics inclined to agree though i should point out that class politics is a kind of 
politics too sc a different identity sure yeah ka a different identity and the point is we should be 
track of all of the ways in which all of the identities intersect with questions of justice and fairness 
done a bad job of that i think in as i say i feel deeply that let down a 
part of the population white well for many reasons part of it is to do with the general afraid 
of our political system and because a significant part of the problem these people face is the result of 
that are good for business decisions to offshore jobs or to use robots which increase productivity and shareholder value 
all the things that you care about if you are running a company ka and because those people want 
be allowed to do those things which i think is fine provided some of the wealth created by doing 
things is spent on making lives okay for the people whose lives are disrupted by these things true that 
have a problem of unemployment at the moment in this country since the return of jobs after but we 
have a problem of satisfying significant wellpaid jobs sc mmhmm yeah ka and we are a very rich country 
we could do something about that and we and i really do think that part of the reason is 
easier to make gestures around race and gender gestures because we have still got huge inequalities around both of 
than it is to make the gestures or make real significant change around these economic inequality issues sc well 
think this is a key point because sort of personally sympathetic to those who want to highlight the ways 
which people are treated unfairly because of their identity whether gender or race or whatever ka or class sc 
class but as you just pointed out i think very worth emphasizing that can be a cheap and easy 
to take when the reality is more complicated right ka yes and i think got to be careful of 
an important fact that a significant part of the integration of the elite universities in this country in respect 
race has been done by bringing in very very elite black people still a real problem and by the 
we done a terrifically good job of bringing in nonelite white people to the universities either our universities are 
significant part of the problem in the intergenerational transfer of class privilege in the united states sc yeah if 
understand it correctly been told that affirmative action which has all sorts of problems but one of the cheapest 
most efficient ways of creating a black middle class ka yeah sc you just take a bunch of black 
who have gone to college otherwise you send them to really good colleges they go back and everything improves 
much easier to sort of do that along racial categories than along class categories i would say ka yes 
mean i think many of the africanamericans who were integrated into say the elite universities starting in the late 
say that the universities could have done a better and by the way at that point there was a 
bit more class variety among the first for some reason among the generations but i think they might say 
these places could have done a better job of changing to meet them not making them feel unwelcome sc 
ka by just going on the way they sc welcome to our wasp enclave ka oh yes exactly and 
taking interesting is that only in the remember that systematic discrimination against jews really stops in these institutions so 
sc oh absolutely ka been no problems for people other than black people sc caltech tried to hire albert 
but it was just such an antisemitic place he go ka yes right he did fine at the institute 
advanced study so okay sc he did call it a concentration camp at one point but then he backed 
ka okay sc yeah more than enough antisemitism there also but not as bad as california ka so i 
i think but sorry what i was going to say about that is that the way in which the 
generations of jewish intellectuals who were admitted to places like columbia and harvard and so on responded was to 
extent to just enter the wasp cultural thing so if you were not an an american it would not 
occurred to you that lionel trilling i think was jewish and interesting is that a later generation among whom 
think we can include someone like harold bloom who did the thing of saying coming as a jew and 
going sc well this is always a tricky thing with identity the extent to which you assimilate versus assert 
identity at the individual level ka yes and both of these things and in the end you want to 
a world in which people can do what they want to do sc right and they are allowed to 
if what they want ka so they are allowed to assimilate if what they want and so you criticize 
say an oreo or a whatever the insults are for people who are you sc white on the inside 
ka black on white on the inside but you the institution benefits if it adapts if it says got 
kinds of people who are coming what do we need to and i think done some of that for 
in some places and africanamerican studies which is a field that worked in a lot has been part of 
and proud of that i think a useful contribution but done a terrible job of dealing with the class 
in terms of making the place more welcoming if you just a simple set of questions i mean if 
if you build a university around the assumption that everybody has enough money that they need to work while 
college get one kind of institution ka if you recognize as we do here at nyu that many most 
our students are working and have to work because they be they have enough money to eat otherwise or 
buy their books then you have to change the place and you have to think about what hours you 
at how many credits reasonable to expect people to get in and so on you have to change or 
have to have enough money to say have to work if you want which is what princeton does a 
rich institution so nobody has to work basically i mean if your parents can afford it they expect you 
contribute but if they they and not required supposed sc you need to be pretty rich as an institution 
pull that off ka yes well the richest per student institution in the world so it jolly well ought 
be doing it chuckle ka but but we know we do that the largest private university in the united 
and we have a tiny endowment tuitiondriven and we have to be very attentive to the fact that our 
is a huge part of the investment that the families of our students will be making in them in 
whole of their lives the most the largest and we should keep it as small as we can while 
being a great university i think with the people who criticize our failure to think about those questions but 
think the thought that we are not thinking about them because thinking about something else and so that we 
stop thinking about other forms of injustice just seems a non sequitur to me sc a deflection strategy ka 
we should do we should do as many things as we reasonably can to make our and this is 
point about universities but of course a general point about the social institutions of our society that they should 
open to people of all the kinds that there are in our society and on roughly equal terms sc 
certainly this attitude a possible stance one can take you wrote a wonderful book that i really enjoyed called 
cosmopolitanism in certain circles is now used as a quasi antisemitic slur but i think we want to reclaim 
as a positive thing to be but not an unproblematically positive thing to be what is your sales pitch 
cosmopolitanism ka i think of cosmopolitanism as combining two thoughts the expression kosmopolitēs in greek means citizen of the 
one thought is just that some important sense in which each of us should think of all the other 
in the world as our fellow citizens of something this is a metaphor because there a world state so 
literally fellow citizens of anything but we should treat each other in ways that are somewhat like the ways 
treat fellow citizens which means i assume that we should care for what happens to them and try to 
the world so that they can do well just as we can do well ka and that maybe not 
in every group of citizens shares this but we should be sort of interested in them not just in 
of making their lives better but in what like wanting to get to know them one thing and the 
thing is that wanting to get to know them is important because different some of them from us and 
we need them to become like us whatever like anybody else sc it can be good ka it can 
in fact more interesting to live in a world where not everybody is the same a point that john 
mill makes beautifully in on liberty that we profit from other what he called experiments of living in this 
we have the swedish healthcare model to think about in deciding how what going to do if they done 
experiment we know anything about it it would all be theoretical and it would be done by economists and 
would probably be pretty pretty bad sc know less ka know a great deal less than by constructing a 
theories of these matters the two things is now the the slogan is universality plus difference the universality thing 
elements that i think are compulsory morally compulsory you have moral obligations to every human being also to animals 
a complication that i will avoid from now on you have obligations to other human beings and in particular 
have obligations not to harm them not to create not to do things in the world that cause serious 
to people elsewhere but i think the second thing the thing of taking pleasure in difference is morally compulsory 
think if you want to hive yourself off if you want to go if you want to be an 
farmer in pennsylvania and you want to interact with what they call the americana the americans around them i 
you have to be free to do that and if you want to live in the sc if letting 
others live their lives and you want to interact with them then fine ka and you want to be 
orthodox in jerusalem as long as not throwing stones at people who are driving on the sabbath which some 
them do unfortunately fine the total package i think can be argued to be morally compulsory the first part 
the package is compulsory just morality and it includes respect for human rights and all these other things the 
for taking the whole package just that well there are two pitches one is an instrumental pitch we need 
cosmopolitans we have to interact got global warming got a whole bunch of problems got pandemics sc one planet 
ka one planet and interconnected ecologically healthwise i like to remind my students that every year somebody collects influenza 
in rural china so that we have a flu vaccine by the time they get here right sc yeah 
a very complicated international thing and done by be much less likely to happen if nobody was nobody here 
interested in there and nobody there was interested in here so an instrumental reason but i think also just 
sort of jouissance a pleasure reason namely that if you think one way to get at this is to 
about what are the great aesthetic objects that we care about if we care about aesthetic objects there are 
like music which is fantastically transnational in its sources and effects and i mean popular music but i also 
at beethoven handel the royal fireworks that handel wrote for a german is the british royal family he was 
composer in britain he was employed in britain ka favorite global example probably the most famous japanese poet is 
basho writes in a script invented by the chinese and belongs to a religion invented by the indians a 
buddhist no china no india no basho sc right and no crosscultural stuff ka and no crosscultural stuff no 
mother writing haiku as i was growing up because she had discovered basho and thought he was a wonderful 
so most famous play is about a danish prince not an english prince so the things we care about 
the cultural domain spontaneously cross boundaries steal borrow appropriate whatever you want to call it sc well i was 
to at some point mention there the darker side of cultural appropriation which is more about sort of caricaturing 
even disrespecting other cultures ka yes sc i kind of i want to say that i love cultural appropriation 
love it when cultures mix and interact and inspire each other but again in the sense of absolutely understanding 
who are blatantly against it because it can be so badly used ka right this is one of those 
where i think the sort of boring distinctions that philosophers make are really useful and helpful and get people 
see things more clearly so the word appropriation is not terribly useful to talk about of justin trudeau in 
face whose culture was he borrowing sc he appropriating ka he taking anything from anybody sc he was just 
inconsiderate ka he was just representing people in a disrespectful way not appropriation and if he had done it 
the purpose suppose he had been dressing up for that purpose in order to play a role in a 
that was meant to make a point about racism we would not have a problem with it sc sorry 
people would ka well some people would but because confused about the distinction or that not keeping track of 
fact that some ways of taking things that either are made by or represent other people are disrespectful and 
and if you and one kind of disrespect is exploitation so if i know whether paul use of mbaqanga 
from south africa was good or bad for the people that sang in the choirs and worked with him 
but if it it should have been sc yeah ka yes but but if it that an argument that 
resulting music is a bad thing an argument about the badness of how it was made and no reason 
to listen to it even once discovered that because its existence as music is different from its status as 
sort of product of a moral process sc so in some sense there can be perfectly acceptable things that 
be labeled cultural appropriation but a sensitivity that needs to come into it ka yes right and and when 
old enough that when i was a kid with my grandmother in england i watched a television program called 
black and white minstrel show in in which english people white english people perform in sambo black face with 
red lips and the music was great as it happens at least i thought i enjoyed it and i 
innocent enough that it occur to me how ridiculous it was that they had to put those faces on 
order to do it so that tradition of sort of sambo black face is obviously horrible and to continue 
is to be insensitive to the badness of that history but not all sharing and borrowing and taking and 
stealing is like that and wrong with theft is that theft laughter sc no sharing ka not sharing sc 
agreement yeah ka right so i think we want to stop the flow well sorry i want to stop 
flow i know people do want to stop the flow and sad about that because as i say i 
if i think about the my mother appropriated ashanti anansi stories in order to give american and british children 
wonderful to read and i know a lot of africanamericans of my generation who remember reading them my version 
these african stories my white version when they were kids so i just see anything wrong with that because 
was done with love and respect and with acknowledgement she pretend that she made them up sc well this 
i mean you just said we then you changed it to i and i think that brings up probably 
last big point i want to get on the table which is you talk in the book about the 
of positivism logical positivism or just positivism ka i think i call it positivism sc yeah anyway the important 
of it for you was the fact value distinction and how values are not quite fixed by the facts 
when you are trying to be a good cosmopolitan one of the questions that arises is how judgy we 
be about what goes on in other cultures an argument made by various dictatorships around the world that you 
judge us a different culture and very much in favor of judging them in fact sharon street one of 
colleagues here at nyu was very influential for my way of thinking about how you cannot think that morality 
fixed by the universe or objectively out there you can construct it but it still exists and you can 
it to judge other people ka yeah good so i believe this too why i get a visa to 
to china because criticize them sc you believe it out loud yes ka i believe it out loud though 
that change their minds i would love to go to china interested in going on in china and not 
interested in destroying the political system though i wish it were more generous to its critics so i think 
way to think about it is the way i think about it anyway is what the cosmopolitan recommends is 
kind of crosscultural conversation which means that more likely to get your criticisms right if you been listening to 
if not paying attention to what really doing if you really care about them you will criticize them but 
your criticisms will miss the mark ka so for example to take a case that everybody wants to bring 
things to do with female genital cutting no point in criticizing that practice in a society unless you know 
they do and unless you know what the women been through it think about it even if you think 
a state of false consciousness you need to know what thinking and the fact is that what we what 
call female circumcision as a practice ranges enormously in what it is and some of it involves just a 
to the labia and i am against any kind of unnecessary physical mutilation of children but not very serious 
incision removal of the clitoris and sewing up the labia a very sc very serious ka bad idea and 
for but here again this is to get across the badness of it one of the things you have 
notice is that bad for fertility and most of the societies which practice it care about fertility so a 
about it that they should care about but you know that if you been paying attention and i think 
respectful interventions from outside have this is true with female genital cutting in senegambia in west africa the successful 
have been by people who came in and wag their fingers but they just talked to people they talked 
the medical stuff they talked about human rights and the rights of children ka they even directly and they 
until the moment when somebody said think maybe that means that we and then they said if what you 
figure out how to make it happen try and persuade everybody in this village but not do it on 
own because we marry the kids in the next village our daughters marry their sons their sons marry our 
we need to persuade them as well otherwise we be able to right i mean simple point but again 
know that you have to know something about the lives of these people sc well a very good point 
to be judgy okay to think that the practices of other cultures are wrong but it requires a certain 
of work it requires a certain amount of sensitivity and education ka yes and both in order to make 
that your criticism is correct and to be in a position to do anything at all effective to try 
persuade them to do it the other way in a book that i wrote about honor i pointed out 
the end of the practice of footbinding in china was significantly brought about by the presence in china of 
christian missionaries who were enormously respectful of chinese civilization but thought this practice which particularly unchristian just a bad 
was a bad practice and they they got chinese intelligentsia members of the chinese intelligentsia very famous people like 
youwei to see this and the chinese then organized antifoot binding societies as they had organized antiopium societies and 
they overcame footbinding ka over a generation it went away over twenty years it went from in many places 
sort of basically zero in lots of places at different times in different places but very very swift so 
are going to be better at doing the being judgy because more likely to be interested in actually going 
sc yeah you might learn something along the way ka yeah and also listening not just talking and the 
is i want the chinese to be able to criticize our prison system which is way more incarcerating than 
percentagewise and at least in hong kong though not in much of china the prisons are pretty good in 
of conditions not sweden but definitely better than many prisons in louisiana so i think we the cosmopolitan wants 
listen as well as talk and in that conversation we will be judged and fine part of the point 
oh yeah part of the bargain right ka yes and also part of what we get because because maybe 
something wrong maybe maybe you sc almost certainly doing something wrong chuckle ka yes for sure we are and 
be evident to us or it be as evident to us as it might be to someone looking outside 
the outsider has to be attentive to what actually up to too the outsider who just waves a hand 
says americans do something something they lock their parents up they lock their grandparents up in old so not 
a i mean not a very good description of going on sc do you think this kind of strategy 
be helpful in spreading democracy around the world is that too much to ask ka i think the only 
that might help in though one of the things about democracy and by the way the language of human 
is that on the whole once you get them into the hands of ordinary people they think a good 
the government that may not be so keen on democracy but the people usually think it would be a 
idea to be consulted and a good idea to play a role and a good idea to have their 
protected by their own state and if their own state know knowing that their state will be criticized by 
states if it and just as their state should criticize other states when they do things right for their 
citizens so i but that means of course that going to have to be ka the forms of democracy 
going to be different going to going to have different backgrounds different traditions different challenges the kind of issues 
arise in a multiethnic society like ghana where no majority ethnicity are different from the kinds that arise in 
society which are multiracial and a dominant ethnic racial group right those are just different and what you have 
do in designing your democracy to deal with the problems is different in those two cases but also it 
upon the history the germans i think not unreasonably violate a principle that is embedded in our law about 
of expression by not allowing people to publish copies of mein kampf given the history of germany i think 
crazy decision sc yeah right ka but it would be i think it would be wrong to stop americans 
access to mein kampf even though some of them are going to use it to form altright groups that 
draw swastikas on synagogues and do idiotic things like that so i but that again that conversation across societies 
what free expression is and recognizing that different in different place we expect abu dhabi to immediately go to 
regime of regulation of pornography that we have in the united states just not going to work for them 
the history is different the culture is different ka the different sc the expectations are different ka but we 
try and persuade them as they should try to persuade us that on the whole their society will work 
and will be fairer to its people if they allow them pretty broad freedom to say what they want 
i like it it all seems very reasonable talking to each other enjoying food from different places chuckle ka 
sc it gives me some optimism that the world can become a more cosmopolitan place ka yes and just 
the bbc not going to remember the exact numbers but the bbc did a poll a couple years ago 
the world asking people if they thought they were citizens of the world in fact they asked them in 
view a ridiculous question which was you more of a citizen of the world than you are of your 
is the wrong question because the whole point about cosmopolitanism is it requires you to be loyal to some 
things as well because what bringing to the cosmopolitan conversation but anyway they found that in many countries including 
united states a significant number of people were willing to say even to that bizarre question ka so i 
how many would have said yes if ask the right question which is you a citizen of the world 
well as a citizen of your but in many countries it was a majority of the population that said 
felt more like citizens of the world than they did of their own country right now some of them 
places like nigeria where you can understand that because the nigerian state is a mess but some of i 
i wish i could remember the details but worth looking up so i think there is as i say 
require everybody to do this we expect everybody to do this sc and okay ka but fine part of 
cosmopolitan thing is that cool with difference i would be happy if an amish family were willing to let 
come and spend time and see what their life was like but not they like and i can see 
i particularly you know do i want some wellintentioned french straight person to say i come and spend time 
your gay family in order to see what gay sc chuckle ka well i know sc be the subject 
that experiment yeah ka that seems like a weird thing so the thing is that the it has to 
a conversation among equals for it to be really productive and the world is full of inequalities and that 
it really hard sc yeah well kwame anthony appiah conversations among equals are always great things and maybe this 
not equals but anyway on the same page thanks so much for being on the podcast ka it was
