click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll 
doing something a little bit unusual in the podcast today in the sense that i like doing unusual things 
trying to experiment here but usually every episode is completely different in topic than the previous episode and the 
episode but you can think of this episode and last as sort of a matched set sc last week 
talked to ramez naam about the optimistic view on our energy future how we can switch to renewable energies 
really combat global climate change today talking to michael mann who is a professor of atmospheric science the distinguished 
of atmospheric science at penn state university one of the most informed and most wellknown experts on the bad 
of climate change that is to say how fast happening the evidence for it and the deleterious effects going 
have on our world sc so i think that because climate change is so challenging this is the right 
to have these podcasts as optimistic as we want to be really really important to keep the challenges in 
mike mann of course is famous or infamous for being involved in all sorts of political controversies in climate 
not really his fault if you look into the information but he and his coauthors were the author of 
original hockey stick paper and graph where you could see over hundreds of years how the temperature had been 
or less static and then was zooming up in recent times the socalled hockey stick graph that got him 
ire of all sorts of wellfinanced opposition people so we talk a little bit about that but honestly we 
most of our time in this episode talking about the science sc mike was actually a physics undergraduate major 
so he knows that a physicist so we dig in a little bit to the physics of how the 
is changing how we know that changing and what we might do about it even though this is sort 
the pessimistic of the two shows still some reason for optimism here basically in our hands what we want 
do always true but for climate change an especially urgent message sc remember you can go to the website 
to get transcripts show notes and links also links to our patreon page if you want to support the 
you can get adfree versions of the episode as well as monthly ask me anything episodes and with that 
music sc mike mann welcome to the mindscape podcast michael mann thanks great to be with you sean sc 
presume that everyone listening has heard of the fact that our climate is changing a little bit might be 
up storms and things like that but because of all of that stuff that already inundated with i thought 
fun just to start with taking a step back remembering going on here remembering that something called the greenhouse 
that known for a very long time so why you give us your version of the quick and simple 
is why things are changing and why we should care mm yeah so absolutely right the basic science here 
science underlying humancaused climate change goes back nearly two centuries those of us who were trained as physicists of 
appreciate the name joseph fourier and familiar of course with his fundamental contributions to mathematics the fourier series or 
fourier transform the law of heat conduction through solids law well fourier actually understood he worked out the details 
he understood that there must be a greenhouse effect because the surface of the earth is warmer than it 
be given the output of the sun and our distance from the sun mm and so essentially over the 
two centuries we have been refining our understanding of the basic science but nearly two centuries old so this 
an this new controversial science science that goes back farther than the theory of evolution moreover we would not 
able to explain basic observations like venus why is venus as hot as it is and why is mars 
cold as it is without understanding the greenhouse effect so the basic science behind humancaused climate change the greenhouse 
is irrefutable in fact in the absence of any greenhouse effect at all earth would be a frozen minus 
degrees celsius sc yeah i think a very important point not like the greenhouse effect is something that bringing 
existence it exists and tinkering with it a little bit mm right and we should be thankful to the 
effect because earth would be a frozen and almost certainly lifeless planet in the absence of the natural greenhouse 
natural gases in the atmosphere water vapor being important among them carbon dioxide methane that have this warming impact 
the surface they absorb some of the outgoing heat energy trying to escape to space and they send some 
that energy back down towards the surface of the earth and so that warms up the earth and it 
it to the relatively balmy eighteen degrees celsius or roughly fiftynine degrees fahrenheit temperature that the planet actually has 
habitable planet the problem of course sc sorry mike let me just stop you very quickly because as a 
i just have to dig into this a little bit the amazing thing here is that of course these 
gases are perfectly transparent to visible light we get light from the sun but then we sort of process 
a little bit and guess what the entropy increases this is one of my favorite facts about the universe 
so we radiate it back as infrared light at a different wavelength different frequency and these same gases are 
to that what causes the heat to be trapped is that fair mm no right and this goes back 
some of our early the early semiclassical physics we studied as undergraduates i believe law the temperature of an 
determines the amount of blackbody radiation it produces through the stefanboltzmann law and so the sun which has a 
temperature of about six thousand kelvin i believe through law that tells us that the center of the distribution 
the radiation producing is in the visible and so we see the sun we see the visible radiation coming 
a six thousand kelvin object whereas the earth is about two hundred eightyeight kelvins and the same law law 
us that the peak of the distribution of radiation that the earth is producing the blackbody radiation the earth 
producing is centered in the infrared a completely different part of the electromagnetic spectrum mm and what these greenhouse 
do they can actually absorb those wavelengths of radiation so if we were wearing infraredsensitive glasses and we were 
up at the atmosphere it would look relatively opaque to us because those greenhouse gases water vapor which is 
some of which is natural but increasing it by fossil fuel burning those molecules because of their vibrational and 
modes of freedom are able to absorb and emit radiation in the red part of the spectrum roughly microns 
of radiation and that is indeed why they act as greenhouse gases and they warm the surface of the 
sc you must have been a physics major back in the day this is great mm i look back 
on those days and in fact i often find myself drawing upon my training as a physicist in the 
that i do today mm and did for or it fourier but someone back in those days did point 
burning fossil fuels i know if they called them back then but probably putting new in the atmosphere so 
idea that increasing the greenhouse effect is also pretty venerable mm yeah right and in fact i believe it 
actually amazing these sort of renaissance people of science back in the century who could work on so many 
important problems arrhenius of course is known for giving us one of the prevailing definitions of an acid in 
field of chemistry but he also recognized that there was a greenhouse effect of course that had already been 
and that we were probably increasing it by burning fossil fuels he think that that would be that much 
a problem but he was aware of the basic science behind it sc okay so he turned out to 
right now of go in i think a little bit more to the details there but just very quickly 
of course there are also complications not quite that simple that is the simplest basic story and then there 
things that work in extra influences in both directions mm right and physicists we like to start out with 
assume a spherical planet well actually a good sc a pretty good one yeah mm and the sun so 
assumptions are pretty good but we have to make of course all sorts of other assumptions when we speak 
the problem at this level of simplicity because there always are complexities we can for example abstract the earth 
a point in space and we can simply work out the radiative balance of that point in space of 
earth as if it was just a mathematical point in space and we would be balancing the incoming what 
call the short wave radiation that high frequency ultraviolet and visible radiation coming in from the sun and we 
to balance that with the outgoing what we call the long wave that is the infrared radiation being emitted 
the earth taking into account this layer of greenhouse gases and we can construct it a very simple zerodimensional 
that literally a model where no latitude no longitude and no altitude mm the earth is just a point 
space but we do account for the fact that an atmosphere through our treatment of the greenhouse effect and 
such a simple model a zerodimensional energy balance model you can come up with a pretty good answer you 
actually estimate the temperature of the earth very accurately using the parameter the emissivity that measures the greenhouse effect 
the atmosphere mm you can go further than that you can actually use a zerodimensional energy balance model to 
the response of the global average temperature all this model can tell you it tell you the temperature in 
arctic or the temperature at the equator or the temperature up in the troposphere versus way up in the 
it can only give you a single number the average surface temperature of the earth but it does a 
job with that and you can actually model changes in the average temperature of the earth back in i 
an article in scientific american where i used a simple zerodimensional energy balance model mm one of the simplest 
equations you could hope to write down a first order linear differential equation that you can solve analytically or 
if you like and i use that model to demonstrate the response that we can expect of the average 
of the planet to various scenarios of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and the numbers i came up with are 
indistinguishable from the numbers that climate modeling groups using the most elaborate threedimensional climate models of the ocean and 
atmosphere and the stratosphere and the carbon cycle and the clouds and everything else you can imagine that are 
on supercomputers they come up with pretty much the same answer that i come up with using that zerodimensional 
balance model in that scientific american article and in fact in the supplementary link you can go there and 
that program and run it yourself on your pc if you like you could never do that with a 
global climate model mm but the zerodimensional energy balance model going to tell you anything about changes in rainfall 
or ice sheets or sea level rise or shifting wind patterns the el niño phenomenon going to happen to 
in central pennsylvania where i live or out in california where you live all the questions we would really 
to answer that not going to give us the answers we need so we go to increasingly more elaborate 
that incorporate that account for more of the processes in the system a hierarchy of models and we see 
of course in physics physics is wellknown you start out with a simple conceptual model or even a good 
experiment and you build up from that but where you derive your intuition about a problem and it can 
our interpretation of the problem sc absolutely interesting to me that the answer is so close i have a 
deal of confidence that the simple model should be in the ballpark and then you can tweak it but 
know that there are other effects that do pushin both directions and is there some physical intuitive explanation for 
they either do they balance out or are they just all just smaller than you would think mm yeah 
i was a bit glib in the way i characterized it in reality you have the advantage in a 
model of this sort that got a small number of tunable parameters if you will parameters that you can 
and you have the freedom to choose those parameters in such a way that you get the right answer 
probably the most important parameter in that regard is what we call the climate sensitivity how much warming do 
get for a doubling of concentrations and our best estimates are that probably somewhere in the neighborhood of three 
three degrees celsius so a little less than six fahrenheit warming if you double the concentration of carbon dioxide 
the atmosphere preindustrial levels were about two hundred eighty parts per million so we will hit that doubling of 
five hundred sixty parts per million in a matter of a few decades if we continue on the course 
on mm and one of the key metrics of climate change is this socalled climate sensitivity now in a 
coupled ocean atmosphere ice sheet the most elaborate climate models you can imagine that is an emergent phenomenon you 
estimate that from actually putting all of the representing all the processes and seeing what answer you get in 
zerodimensional energy balance model just a specified parameter so all of these feedback processes that we know are important 
with the melting of ice or the evaporation of water into the atmosphere or changing vegetation there are lots 
feedback processes responses of the climate system itself to the warming that modify the warming mm and so they 
positive or negative feedbacks that have to be incorporated if going to describe the full nature of the response 
this system in the zerodimensional energy balance model we can summarize all that with one parameter the climate sensitivity 
though not representing the ice sheets or the carbon cycle or any of the things that actually end up 
that sensitivity sc no actually very helpful and i love that you called it an emergent phenomenon actually very 
or in fact exactly the same as what we would call the renormalization group approach in fundamental physics where 
lot of stuff going on underneath the surface but for the net effect on large macroscopic scales you can 
it up in sort of one simple parameter mm right exactly yeah sc but nevertheless still complications we do 
about one that i just gotta get out of the way right away is what do we even mean 
we talk about the global mean temperature right the temperature here where i live in los angeles even the 
as it is in pasadena what a ride away where my office is so how do you go about 
that average what really counts when you say here is the temperature of the earth right now mm yeah 
it should really be thought of as just again i suppose a metric a measure of climate change that 
useful in characterizing certain global scale responses for example sea level rise by and large is a function of 
average temperature of the planet there are various other attributes the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere 
essentially a function of the average temperature of the planet but as you allude to we live in the 
average we live in particular locations land turns out to warm faster and more than oceans when you increase 
greenhouse effect and that has to do with a number of processes but oceans have more thermal inertia a 
heat capacity so they respond more sluggishly to the increasing downward flex of heating from increased greenhouse gases whereas 
land responds more quickly mm and so there is a very large amount of regional variation if you shut 
the north atlantic ocean current known as the conveyor belt sometimes called the gulf stream although technically speaking the 
stream is something a little different really a winddriven gyre the north atlantic drift is this water that continues 
on into near iceland and greenland and then eventually sinks because it becomes cold enough and salty enough to 
and it forms this socalled conveyor belt this relatively warm surface current that flows north towards iceland and greenland 
europe and if you shut that current system down you can actually get a cooling in certain regions this 
popularized of course in the film the day after tomorrow and i be surprised if you actually reviewed that 
i know sc no i stay away mm yeah one of those fun when hollywood and science intersect to 
about you know what they get right and what they get wrong they get a lot wrong you have 
get a lot wrong to take something that would play out over a time scale of decades to a 
and have it occur in a matter of days and so a caricature of the science but what happens 
that film there is a grain of truth as there always is to the scenario and if you were 
shut down the north atlantic drift or the conveyor belt ocean circulation you could get a cooling for example 
iceland and so you do have to understand these regional responses changes in ocean currents changes in wind patterns 
of that for california for example what happens to california when it comes to drought seen epic drought over 
last decade a little bit of a relief over the last year or two chuckle mm yeah well relief 
you want to call drenching sc only relatively yeah but yeah yeah we got a lot of rain here 
la but not even sure if technically out of the drought yet i think we finally are but not 
as if a tropical rainforest around here mm no exactly i was actually looking just the other day at 
drought map the current us drought map and the very faintest yellow which indicates a very slight drought in 
little corner near san diego but otherwise the rest of california is white which is to say neutral sort 
neither in drought or having experiencing an excess of rain but seen epic droughts and they will likely get 
more pronounced and more extended as we continue to warm the planet and why that happens some of it 
to do with the warming of the soils and you get more evaporation but a lot of it has 
do with changing atmospheric circulation the sort of belt of deserts is located in an area where you have 
motion in the atmosphere part of a circulation cell where you have rising motion near the equator and sinking 
the subtropics and that sinking air is warm and dry and why large parts of california and other areas 
the subtropics tend to be relatively dry mm in the winter you get some of these midlatitude storm systems 
fronts or the trailing edge of the fronts coming down into the region and where you get most of 
rainfall well what the models predict is that all those patterns shift poleward so the dry subtropical deserts shift 
and the midlatitude storms the midlatitude cyclones that bring rainfall with them those shift poleward as well that means 
california an increasingly large part of california will find itself well within the core belt of deserts and missing 
lot of the rainfall that it used to get in the winter from these trailing storms systems but how 
that will get how quickly that will happen that all depends on getting the weather right getting these weather 
and their behavior right in these models and that can be a tricky thing because weather is really complicated 
lot of chaotic behavior nonlinear dynamical behavior things that are sometimes difficult to capture in a model for example 
coarse in its spatial resolution that get all of the detailed the regional processes right mm so there are 
wild cards question marks when it comes for example to what will happen to rainfall in california still uncertainty 
precisely what will happen there even if we can say california will warm up and that be less snowpack 
more evaporation from warmer soils all of that favors drought but what happens to these storm systems still sort 
up in the air no pun intended sc yeah no i definitely want to get into that i have 
serious questions not serious like doubtful but i understand but first i think that my actual question was a 
bit simpler i just wanted know what it means to say the global average temperature i mean if the 
has different temperatures both latitude and longitudewide but even in altitude what is the thing that we are defining 
we imagine having a thermometer at literally every point in space in the atmosphere and then taking the average 
is it something dumber than that mm yeah you put your finger right on it literally if we had 
thermometer everywhere over the surface of the earth and as you allude to reduce that thermometer measurement to sea 
because obviously that elevation is going to be colder so implicit in that is the notion that you could 
a surface that would be at sea level covering the entire planet and if you could do that and 
you could make measurements everywhere on land at the ocean surface and at elevation reducing those temperatures there are 
ways to do that but a dry atmosphere cools at about ten degrees celsius per kilometer we call that 
lapse rate and so you can reduce temperatures to sea level the number that you would theoretically come up 
it by the way is the only number that is estimated in a zerodimensional energy balance model so that 
is envisioning a temperature measured precisely in the way that we just described sc okay so some more or 
agreedupon procedure for taking the data we have about the temperature at different locations on earth and converting that 
a best fit number that we would call the global mean temperature mm yeah right sc and you got 
start as far as i understand it in actually trying to push this idea backward in time trying to 
out what it had been over time so tell me how you got into that and how we do 
mm sure thing yeah so early on in my phd studies i was interested in understanding came in as 
physicist and i was interested in constructing models for describing the natural variability of climate i really looking at 
change i was interested in natural cycles in the climate that have to do with oscillations in the way 
ocean and the atmosphere interact with each other the most wellknown of these is the el niñosouthern oscillation or 
sc noone denies that the climate does change even without our help mm absolutely and and when we talk 
natural climate change there are two types of natural climate change they can be externally driven by changes in 
output or volcanic eruptions that have a cooling influence on the planet there are various on longer time scales 
ice ages are driven by changes in orbital geometry relative to the sun so there are these natural external 
and then the fact that the climate like the weather is a chaotic system and in fact one of 
claims to fame of our field field of atmospheric science is that that is where our modern conceptual understanding 
chaos actually arose mm it was in a set of equations that my phd advisor in fact barry saltzman 
in the early been studying these equations these equations described sort of it was a simple system for describing 
and it consisted of three coupled partial differential equations and he noticed that these equations were giving rise to 
unusual behavior he thought it was some sort of numerical instability his former mit colleague ed lorenz recognized that 
was something more fundamental going on here and lorenz was trained in the earlier the work by poincaré in 
early century into nonlinear dynamics and understood that this was in fact a real system exhibiting what had been 
a chaotic behavior mm so the atmosphere and weather exhibits chaotic behavior but so does the climate the el 
phenomenon which californians of course are intimately familiar with that is a nonlinear interaction between the tropical pacific ocean 
atmosphere we understand the physics of those interactions pretty well and when you model those interactions they are described 
a set of nonlinear couple of differential equations that give rise to chaotic behavior so this chaotic component to 
climate that even if you changing any of the external parameters just leaving the system to run on its 
it would vary in this chaotic manner just the same way that the weather varies chaotically over time but 
this case el niño is a three to seven year cycle the weather midlatitude weather systems have timescales of 
to a week the el niño phenomenon because of the longer timescales of the tropical pacific ocean those oscillations 
on timescales of years three to seven years mm i was interested in potentially longer timescale oscillations in the 
system related for example to midlatitude ocean gyres the gulf stream being part of them these are ocean circulation 
that sort of have intrinsic decadal timescales so if an oscillation it could have decadal or longer timescales i 
interested in the extent to which those oscillations exist and it turns out you run into a problem if 
for example in multidecadal solutions like year cycles some evidence that they may exist then only got a century 
widespread thermometer measurements so sort of stuck basically one cycle you really identify an oscillation you do a fourier 
do a fourier transform a spectrum you estimate the spectrum of a data set and hope to isolate a 
that has a timescale close to the length of the data set mm so that led me to become 
in other types of climate data that could take us farther back in time socalled proxy records like tree 
and corals and ice cores and what led me on this sort of journey which ultimately led to an 
of temperature changes over the past thousand years and the socalled hockey stick curve that placed me right at 
center of the very contentious battle over climate change but the questions that motivated that work actually had nothing 
do with climate change itself sc that is hilarious i realize that it came from the lorenz and the 
forays into nonlinear dynamics and chaos but it makes perfect sense in retrospect mm yeah and interesting the interplay 
atmospheric science and meteorology and physics it really goes back to the origins of to some extent of both 
so there is this very nice interconnectedness which is appealing to me because again i got my start in 
sc and so a thousand years i presume a nonarbitrary number some reason why the regime in which we 
accurately measure the global temperature is that right mm at the time in fact in we published our first 
and that only went back six hundred years then based on the analysis of other records we found that 
were enough longer records that we could actually obtain meaningful results a thousand years back and there are sort 
internal diagnostics that you can look at a statistical problem and there are statistics that you can look at 
tell you whether or not your prediction or your estimate is likely to be meaningful or not and so 
can look at the time of that first study those statistics told us we go back any further than 
hundred years with the data we had and get a meaningful answer but by digging into some additional longer 
we were able to extend it back a thousand years mm now scientists have literally extended these sorts of 
millennia back in time one tentative estimate of this sort that now goes back well into the last ice 
years back in time and now we understand that the spike of warming that found in our study which 
the warming of the last century to be unprecedented in a thousand years well these studies now show that 
in tens of thousands of years and potentially although we have the data to conclude that likely that the 
spike seeing now is unprecedented in hundreds of thousands of years if not longer sc and what is there 
particular proxy that is the best what is the best way to figure out what the temperature was a 
years ago mm yeah so if you if you want to go the nice thing about the time frame 
the past thousand years or so is that you do have a number of annually resolved records which is 
say got corals or ice cores or tree rings that have annual layers and so you can get an 
chronology and actually very helpful when trying to calibrate these data against modern records that you can literally align 
and you can do a statistical calibration if you want to go back farther than that you start to 
reliant on sort of lower resolution records sediment cores and pollen these are things that can be dated but 
annually they could be radio carbon dated or there are other methods of dating that provide rough timescales but 
lose that annual resolution which creates additional challenges when trying to calibrate the records against the modern temperature sc 
what is what is the answer you alluded to the hockey stick the fact that right now in the 
century the temperature is zooming up which of course if you plot it at the same time as plotting 
concentration in the atmosphere that also zooms up and exactly what fourier would have predicted i suppose mm exactly 
sean glad you put it that way because really important for people to understand that how science works it 
found a warming spike it was that hah well what else is going on oh fossil fuel burning that 
be the cause just the opposite we have understood for so long that increasing greenhouse gases have to warm 
planet and these observations and these temperature reconstructions are simply confirming what more fundamental science pretty much tells us 
to happen and really important for people to understand because one way in which science is often misrepresented mm 
to create a straw man these scientists were just looking for a cause and the two things happened to 
not how it works sc well and also one of the popular responses among climate skeptics is that there 
many natural ways for the climate to vary and of course true but nothing like the timescales seeing here 
correct me if wrong but investigations such as yours have helped us understand things like the medieval warming period 
the little ice age and these are real but more gradual and we understand them is that fair mm 
absolutely right and those past climate patterns we now understand quite well those past climate anomalies if you will 
little ice age and the medieval climate anomaly in fact moved away from calling it the medieval warm period 
it was actually quite cold in a large part of the tropical pacific sc a little eurocentric there to 
it the warm period yeah mm right and we now understand a good deal of that going on with 
past natural changes unlike the warming happening right now which is pretty much globally ubiquitous warming happening just about 
over the surface of the earth these past periods you might have warmth in europe but cold in the 
pacific cold in parts of north america and happening is seeing the response to changes in ocean circulation patterns 
wind patterns those are things that tend to cancel out in a global average not changing the overall radiation 
of the earth like you are with greenhouse gases just sort of shifting heat around and increasingly these past 
very much appear to reflect those sorts of changes regionally cancelling so that if you look at the global 
of the little ice age or the medieval climate anomaly there are changes in global average temperature of a 
of tenths of a degree celsius that are consistent with the drivers changes in solar output volcanoes those can 
or cool the global climate mm they can change the global average temperature but they also interact with these 
modes like el niño or the pattern known as the north atlantic oscillation how the jet stream varies over 
america and europe these forcings these radiative these external changes can interact with modes of climate variability leading to 
regional changes that largely cancel in the global average and if you do the global average you find that 
with how the underlying factors are changing the global radiation budget of solar or volcanic forcing sc so kind 
the difference between heating things up overall and moving the heat around from place to place which at any 
place might seem like a dramatic shift mm exactly and where the modeling and the observations have really come 
because in this area of science in all areas of science always theory and modeling and then there are 
and observations are king in the world of physics observations in our field can be a little tougher to 
with not quite as precise as the measurements that able to make and in particle physics often we have 
error bars on our observations but the observations and the theory work hand in hand in this field as 
do in physics and when you start to have a comprehensive foundation for understanding a phenomenon when the observations 
the theoretical modeling really align and agree with each other and seen the science move in that direction when 
comes to our understanding of the little ice age and the medieval climate anomaly sc so good drag it 
then to the present day and going on so obviously dumping and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere primarily 
fossil fuel burning what is the relative rate of other things i know that cows burping has a lot 
do with it too mm glad you you misrepresent the cows been much maligned sc i know which end 
the cow the methane comes out of mm yeah the end it comes out of the cows nearly sc 
mm exactly as sometimes implied so part of the problem there was a report that just came out an 
special report the ipcc comes out with their major climate reports roughly every five years and the last one 
out a few years ago be another one in a couple of years but in the meantime they often 
these interim reports on specific sort of areas of the science and in this case they were focusing on 
and part of that was focusing on the role of agriculture and livestock in generating greenhouse emissions and it 
a lot of play and sort of interesting and the topic of the book that actually working on right 
is sort of about what are known as deflection campaigns if the fossil fuel industry very convenient to point 
those poor cows and say the or to point at us and say the problem eating beef and eating 
the problem is on us is on you rather not the burning of fossil fuels seen these sorts of 
campaigns many times in the past when it came to the beverage industry and bottle and can litter the 
industry and many others mm well seeing that to some extent with the fossil fuel industry where a grain 
truth some of those emissions do come from agriculture and livestock but beef is responsible for only i believe 
total carbon emissions are associated with beef livestock and the eating of beef a pretty small piece of the 
we also hear a lot about flying a lot of criticism of well flying is of the carbon emissions 
zero and personal responsibility is part of the solution and we should all try to do everything that we 
to minimize our own personal carbon footprints and often those are sort of lowhanging fruit no regrets decisions on 
part because they save us money they make us healthier they make us feel better and they reduce our 
footprint so we should all do that mm but when it comes to the main source of the problem 
share or roughly just about twothirds of the carbon emissions are from the burning of fossil fuels for energy 
transportation and we have to keep our eye on the ball because we as individuals reduce those emissions if 
work for systemic change that changes our entire energy infrastructure our transportation infrastructure our energy infrastructure and to do 
we need policy and we need politicians who are willing to support policies that are good for us and 
planet rather than the policies that might make huge profits for the fossil fuel interests who fund their campaigns 
so in my view where we really need to be focusing but not lose sight of the fact that 
are things we can do in our everyday lives and reduce our carbon footprint and these things are synergistic 
we do that we send a message to others it puts us on a path of engagement where we 
more committed to doing more and trying to influence policy for example to solve this problem sc yeah actually 
huge believer in solving these kinds of things or tackling them mostly systematically mostly through government or international cooperation 
virtue is great but it it is great honestly i say that sarcastically but it also can be an 
to sort of not worry about the real bigger thing i did i did a podcast interview going to 
these backtoback with ramez naam do you know ramez mm yeah absolutely sure yeah sc so he gave the 
side of the story all about how renewables are coming and going to be driving electric cars and be 
and counting on you to remind us that not automatic and if we actually make an effort to do 
then really bad things are going to happen so i want to say that the pessimistic side of the 
but a little bit of a realist ingredient in the cocktail here mm yeah well my mantra these days 
urgency and agency sc good very good mm yeah we have an urgent problem and we need to act 
not going to solve itself the solution going to happen on its own but there are things that we 
do and there are reasons for cautious optimism not too late to make the changes necessary to avert the 
impacts of climate change so i imagine that he and i probably agree somewhat on the bigger picture but 
more likely to emphasize the need of dramatic policy change now and in particular holding the feet of bad 
to the fire taking to task bad actors and the politicians in their pay who are blocking efforts literally 
to make it more difficult for us to shift towards renewable energy blocking incentives for renewable energy doing everything 
can to throw a monkey wrench into the works and we need to make sure that they get away 
doing that sc i do want to talk specifically about the politics and the policy but one more important 
thing that i want to be clear on which is the relationship of the overall increase in warming with 
sort of local features of the weather right i mean more dramatic weather events have been happening or at 
perceived to be happening it seems like there are more droughts and floods and hurricanes now than there were 
few years ago not obvious to me that a connection there with warming but there seems to be so 
you can explain this to us mm yeah thanks so glad you asked that sean because it actually relates 
some the research that been doing in recent years best known for the paleoclimate work and the hockey stick 
i did decades ago but my research these days focuses to some degree on the impacts of climate change 
extreme weather events in fact last march i had an article in scientific american about the research that we 
been doing that interestingly enough taps into my physicist training and background because some of the mathematics that you 
to solve this problem you actually use the wkb approximation sc oh nice all of my physics students listeners 
hearts just fluttered when you said that mm well yeah and delightful of course when i encounter an opportunity 
actually draw up on my training even in quantum mechanics who would have thought that the of the behavior 
matter at the smallest scales could have implications for our understanding of global scale atmospheric patterns but the mathematics 
out to be similar because it turns out that a phenomenon a resonance phenomenon in the atmosphere seen this 
recent summers so if you think about these really persistent extremes like had in california where you have one 
these blocking patterns a ridge a high pressure system just parked over california for weeks at a time not 
or back east had the opposite had a low pressure system a tendency to get these low pressure systems 
just remain locked in place mm normally these weather systems sort of move along from west to east with 
jet stream but as the jet stream slows and as you change temperature patterns in the atmosphere you can 
create a resonance effect where these systems become stationary and they grow greatly in amplitude so you get these 
deep highs and they sit over the same place like california for weeks on end and when you get 
heat and drought and wildfire and because of the waviness of the jet stream if got one of those 
ridges high pressures parked over the west coast a good chance got the flip side of that sinusoidal wave 
low pressure parked over say the eastern us which is exactly what we saw last summer and we had 
rainfall and flooding mm now what our research shows is that as you change the pattern of temperature with 
so it turns out that the jet stream owes its existence to the difference in temperature between the subtropics 
are warm and the polar regions which are cold and that northsouth change in temperature actually drives eastwest variations 
wind strength through something known as the thermal wind and a combination of the hydrostatic balance in the atmosphere 
the socalled geostrophic law that involves the coriolis force and pressure gradient forces in the atmosphere sc sounds sciencey 
like it mm yeah really fascinating science and it tells us why the jet stream is located where it 
and it also tells us that if you reduce those temperature contrasts for example if you preferentially warm the 
and you warm the subtropics as much going to reduce that temperature gradient that northsouth temperature gradient going to 
the strength of the jet stream and that means that systems are more likely to stay parked not getting 
along as quickly but they grow they can grow in amplitude because of this resonance effect and it turns 
that happens through essentially a wave guide phenomenon where the midlatitudes are acting as sort of a wave guide 
the undulations in the jet stream which are these weather disturbances we call them rossby waves or planetary waves 
they lose energy they radiate energy both vertically but also latitudinally they lose energy radiating to the south and 
the north mm but under certain conditions when the northsouth temperature variations are just right the atmosphere behaves as 
wave guide basically a wall at sort of the subtropical end and at the subpolar end and these rossby 
are funneled through a wave guide with minimum loss of energy and it turns out the mathematics to solve 
the dispersion relation it requires the use of the same wkb approximation that was used in quantum mechanics in 
early century yeah sc great and mm early century yeah sorry sc so in some the atmosphere is not 
in the traditional sense like it we poke it and it runs away to either zero or infinite temperature 
it sounds like the sizes of the fluctuations that it undergoes when it tries to stabilize itself the amplitude 
be increased by the increasing temperature overall mm exactly right this is one mechanism by which you can get 
larger amplitude weather disturbances now obviously there are other mechanisms that come into play so a limit on how 
of that strengthening can happen and it turns out in this case because what we call the simple theory 
barotropic theory which is sort of like a vertically uniform atmosphere ultimately breaks down because the atmosphere barotropic and 
these eventually this condition breaks down and so it reach infinite strength just like hurricanes reach infinite strength there 
dissipating mechanisms that kick in when they become strong enough but the upper limit as to how powerful they 
become whether hurricanes or the amplitude of these weather disturbances does appear to be increasing because of climate change 
yeah so i was just going to say exactly that and hope that you would agree with me that 
to imagine that going to get more droughts going to get more hurricanes going to get more floods going 
get more extreme events as well as an overall increase in temperature mm that increasingly no pun intended appears 
be the case and another area or it is an area where the science has progressed i would say 
decade ago if you had asked me this question these things were very much up in the air but 
models have become far more sophisticated and realistic our observations every day getting new observations and really refined our 
of these connections quite a bit to the point where i think one can say there is now an 
consensus that we will see more extreme weather events and we will see more intense hurricanes and tropical systems 
a result of humancaused climate change sc and you point to any one hurricane and say this is because 
climate but you can point to a lot of hurricanes over a period of time and say this number 
has something to do with how messing up our mm yeah right and in fact we can even point 
some of those individual hurricanes and talk about how not that climate change caused we say climate change caused 
short wave disturbance again a chaotic system and you can run a model ten different times and get a 
result of whether or not a hurricane forms are not in each of those simulations because it is fundamentally 
but once it does form and it begins to strengthen we know that a warming atmosphere warmer ocean temperatures 
evaporative transfer of heat from the ocean surface which is the energy that drives and strengthens these storms in 
a colleague of mine kerry emanuel of mit i think now more than two decades ago worked on a 
elegant theory for tropical cyclones you can actually model them as a carnot cycle sc oh nice mm a 
temperature reservoir at the troposphere at the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere which is the lid on 
rising motion associated with these systems and the surface of the tropical ocean is the warm reservoir and the 
the work done which is a measure of how intense in fact the hurricane can become is a function 
the differences between those temperatures in terms of a yeah a very elegant theory and essentially right and so 
happens is that upper temperature that cold temperature reservoir pretty much stays the same but the warm temperature the 
of the ocean is increasing and so the efficiency increases more work is done these hurricanes become more powerful 
so we can talk about how with a given hurricane it was likely more intense had more water vapor 
it because the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is another nice simple physical relationship known as the 
equation mm basically the evaporation rate increases as an exponential function of the temperature so a warmer atmosphere for 
degree celsius the atmosphere holds about more water vapor and so we can say that these storms have more 
in them that means more moisture to turn into record flooding rainfalls like seen over the last two years 
the two worst flooding events on record for the us that was with harvey and then with florence sc 
okay so why we just remind our listeners of all of the terrible things that are going to happen 
not necessarily i want to get later to the policy soon to the policy because we can do things 
change things but it is good to keep in mind how bad things will get if we change anything 
extreme weather events also rising ocean levels changes in crops and farming what are the things that you fret 
when it comes to climate change the most mm yeah the things that keep me up at night are 
things where there is uncertainty right too often we hear uncertainty offered by the critics as a supposed reason 
inaction oh well not sure so why should we do anything well from a risk management standpoint just the 
of that and especially true especially true because the uncertainties have been cutting against us if you look at 
projections say a decade ago and you look at where we are with respect to the melting of the 
sheets and the rise in sea level or many other measures that the loss of sea ice in the 
we are seeing changes that are at the upper end of the uncertainty ranges that we had put for 
at every juncture mm and what that tells us is that uncertainty has not been our friend as resolved 
uncertainty turned out that the processes that we represented very well when you get those into the models they 
tend to for example accelerate some of these processes a good example is ice sheets in the old day 
ice sheet was treated as just a huge mound of ice but we understand very dynamic in fact you 
use a modified sort of set of fluid dynamics equations to describe the flowing of ice and the constitutive 
of ice it has a complex dynamics to it ice can collapse you have ice cliffs that can collapse 
have ice shelves that provide buttressing support for the ice sheets you have cracks that form in the surface 
allow melt water to rush to the bottom of the ice sheet where it lubricates the base it allows 
ice to surge more quickly out to sea mm and so as we get more of the physics into 
ice sheet models finding that more dynamic and that they can collapse faster and seeing that and seeing sea 
rise faster because of it so uncertainty is not our friend and what keeps me up at night the 
that there is uncertainty and certainly can take the form of the known unknowns as infamously once described by 
political figure there are the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns and the things that keep me up at 
are the unknown unknowns that are lurking out there we know out there and we just discovered them because 
known unknowns have worked out to not be in our favor likely to be true for the unknown unknowns 
well sc well but what about the known knowns we know the sea level is rising sure that safe 
central pennsylvania i did check that here in la our height above sea level is enough that even if 
the ice on earth melted we would still not be underwater but some of my friends on the beach 
not going to be quite so lucky is that going to be worse overall for the planet than the 
fact that the temperature is going up or does it just depend on who you are where you are 
yeah well sea level rise is certainly proceeding faster than we expected and true if you live in jersey 
pennsylvania be fine a town called jersey shore in the middle of pennsylvania that i drive through whenever i 
east sc but if you live on the jersey shore of new jersey going to be a different story 
when i was growing up and i had grandparents in philadelphia we would go to the jersey shore in 
summer and if you live on the jersey shore familiar with it or anywhere along the midatlantic coast new 
city for that matter already miami beach it might even be the best example there is increasing talk about 
retreat we may be essentially beyond the point where there are any adaptations building levees or other means of 
some of our large coastal cities we have to literally retreat from the coastline and obviously as there becomes 
land available and that can be true because of sea level rise literally eroding our coastlines reducing the amount 
coastal land or the amount of total land and got the tropics becoming potentially too warm for human beings 
occupy and so talking about sevenandahalf billion and growing people competing for less space less food and less water 
if that keep you up at night not thinking about it because this really represents a potential crisis from 
security standpoint from a conflict standpoint mm where the scenarios that we that our military experts have gamed out 
of these scenarios and some of them look unlike the postapocalyptic the dystopian futures that hollywood has depicted that 
what our future could look like if we get our act in gear sc and what is your feeling 
the currently on the table political solutions the paris agreement and so forth solution is not the right word 
at least strategy for trying to do better is it enough if we actually all did what the paris 
said we should do would that be enough or is that just a little stopgap mm yeah it would 
us about halfway to the emissions reductions we need to avert warming of two degrees celsius which most scientists 
study the impacts of climate change will tell you if we warm the planet more than two degrees celsius 
little less than four fahrenheit where we start to see some of the worst impacts irreversible impacts of climate 
increasing sc and how much have we warmed it already mm warmed it about degrees celsius already when you 
lot of talk these days about the two degrees celsius target but also a lower degrees celsius target because 
a lowlying island nation already catastrophic warming we will probably lose many of our lowlying tropical island nations and 
coastal regions we may lose the great barrier reef at a warming of degrees celsius so there are credible 
for saying that two degrees celsius is too much we let it get above degrees celsius but sc but 
that already done of it mm so that tells you there a whole lot of wiggle room left is 
and if someone put a gun to your head when would you predict we would hit the two degree 
warming mark mm they have to put a gun to my head in my two thousand fourteen scientific american 
using that zerodimensional energy balance model i made a prediction of precisely that sort of business as usual if 
do nothing then by two thousand thirtysix or so we hit that number and so that tells you two 
celsius degrees celsius comes earlier warming the planet at about almost degrees celsius per decade so if i tell 
at and actually more like per decade and at and trying to avoid we get there even sooner mm 
in fact yeah warming closer to degrees celsius i should say and so we got degrees celsius to work 
there and warming up per decade sc and the us i think the us is the worst i forget 
way it goes the us is the worst per capita or the worst overall mm the worst per capita 
average carbon footprint of an american is about twenty metric tons of carbon the weight of two large african 
african elephants the mass of that the average american is putting into the atmosphere a year and carbon footprints 
literally orders of magnitude smaller than that for most of the developing world increasingly countries like china and india 
they industrialize are approaching a more american sort of sized footprint and obviously a big part of the problem 
well arguably why those of us in the west the us and europe who built our economies on two 
of free access to dirty energy we obviously have a major responsibility if going to tell other countries like 
and india that they have the same right to that cheap energy to build their own economies if going 
tell them that they have the right to do that got to have her own house in order mm 
part of why so important for the us to lead on this issue of course under the current administration 
not sure how much you want to get into the politics of this we of course lack that leadership 
a real problem sc well i think we can state objective facts our current leadership has essentially said that 
not going to follow the paris accord that we agreed with right mm well in fact the current occupant 
the white house has characterized climate change as a hoax perpetrated by the chinese obviously not a good starting 
for a meaningful conversation about solving this problem sc but do you do you get a feeling sure that 
are involved in a whole bunch of international events here do you think that worldwide people are gathering the 
the willpower to try to do something about this or is it maybe a little too little too late 
of feeling mm i do and part of why optimistic is the way that our young folks are sort 
taking control of the public discourse the youth climate movement and going to be a huge march next month 
new york city greta thunberg this this famous girl from sweden but there are other prominent figures in the 
climate movement who have sort of really helped to reframe this in the manner that i think it needs 
be reframed this is a it just science and economics and policy this is ethics this is a matter 
intergenerational ethics our ethical obligation to not leave behind a degraded planet for our children and grandchildren for future 
and the fact that young folks are now speaking up about this i think a game changer i think 
the conversation i think a big part of why we are going to act in time mm we have 
whole lot of wiggle room as i already said and the hour but also seeing a lot of progress 
the reframing of this problem in the way that it needs to be reframed as an existential threat and 
ethical obligation to act now and also seeing remarkable changes in sort of the energy marketplace we are seeing 
rise in renewable energy electric vehicles california of course leading the way but providing a blueprint for what the 
of the states can do and i think going to do it encouraged by the progress seeing but still 
cognizant of the uphill challenge the uphill battle that we face here that we really do need to get 
fossil fuels quickly if going to avert catastrophic warming of the planet sc well also the issue that is 
related to this of course but the issue about how science is done and how the discourse over science 
done i know sure you have a long set of things to say about this been heavily politicized in 
was it completely out of the blue when you were attacked in various ways or did you sort of 
it coming as soon as you started working on climate change mm yeah i can tell you for certain 
when i double majored in applied math and physics at uc berkeley and went off to yale to study 
physics i think that i was on a sc you rabblerouser mm of contentious political debate but when i 
into climate science and really when our work started taking us in this direction when i realized that our 
on paleoclimate did have implications for climate change with the publication of the hockey stick curve back in the 
it became clear to me at that point that i was probably given the history of how other scientists 
were prominent in the climate change arena had been attacked and vilified by fossil fuel interests and front groups 
the hired hands that do their bidding i sort of started to suspect that i might have to deal 
some of those attacks and ultimately when the hockey stick did become this icon in the climate change debate 
it tells this simple story you have to understand the physics of the climate to understand what telling us 
a dramatic change afoot and that responsible for it mm that was a threat to the powerful vested interests 
want to see us move away from our addiction to fossil fuels and i realized pretty soon that i 
find myself in their sights as a central target of their effort to discredit the science and so that 
up taking me in a completely different direction from the one i imagined when i again when i started 
in physics it what i envisioned a life in science looking like but that having been said ultimately come 
embrace the opportunity that given me it the role that i chose it the path that i signed up 
but given me an opportunity to help inform the societal conversation about perhaps the greatest challenge we face as 
civilization i feel privileged to be in that position sc i did do a podcast interview with naomi oreskes 
it was merchants of doubt it was quite an eyeopener i actually been familiar with her work and this 
the thing that i think that we understand if we follow these things closely is that these controversies just 
appear all the time i mean if billions of dollars of profit and income are at stake where there 
vested interests it just makes perfect sense that there will be a concerted effort to affect the way these 
are talked about and the most bizarre thing to me is the idea that people seem to push with 
straight face that somehow climate scientists are financially benefiting from pushing a global warming story clearly these people have 
idea how science actually works mm no exactly right and part of the problem here is scientific literacy and 
fact that the public really understand what scientists do how science works and so possible for bad actors to 
forward these narratives that we know are silly and they know are silly right people making these arguments know 
but it sounds credible to somebody who understand that oh your grants they go into your pocket they fund 
research program and your publications and really easy to take advantage of a relatively scientifically illiterate society interesting i 
just reading a book about the life of carl sagan carl sagan a life by keay davidson a fascinating 
and sagan prophesies this mm he worried about precisely the future that now in where we have a public 
poorly informed about basic matters of science that they are vulnerable especially vulnerable to the forces of pseudoscience which 
primary worry but moreover of antiscience concerted efforts to misrepresent science and to confuse the public and policymakers about 
and its implications living in that world now the very world that sagan feared we might find ourselves in 
a chilling prophecy chilling to read what he had to say about these matters decades ago because his worst 
are sort of coming true and this is a manifestation of that if the public understand how science works 
if a concerted effort to discredit science to attack the integrity of science and scientists and seen those efforts 
effort to undermine the trust that the public has in scientists and what they have to say mm so 
think we have to recognize that the challenges we face whether in climate change or in science writ large 
part of a larger problem which is sort of the lack of good faith in our public discourse and 
emergence of true fake news and alternative facts and the challenge that represents to those of us who deal 
a world of facts sc yeah i think no matter how depressing it gets that certain people are resistant 
facts people are not rational tribalism confirmation bias a whole bunch of things but at the end of the 
we have correctness and truth on our side i think a very very powerful weapon so i insist on 
optimistic about where things are going to go as long as we get our act together mm i agree 
you i think that that ultimately i think that that will win out but in the meantime we have 
real challenge ahead of us sc alright michael mann thanks for fighting the good fight and thanks very much 
being on the podcast mm thank you sean it was a pleasure music what a great podcast informative subtle 
loved it may listen again i am on a responsibility kick like a lot of people i want to 
meat my home is insulated i drive less i buy used clothes the carbon footprint of the very rich 
and almost all of those reading including middle class count as very rich compared to bn average i also 
less the only negative on this is the perspective of plane travel who defend the sector point out that 
currently produces of the emissions but this is because just of the people have ever flown in terms of 
impact taking a flight because of the quantify of fuel it uses inflicts more harm on the living planet 
its people than anything else you are likely to georges monbiot sean another great podcast thank you i am 
meat producing farmer who spends a lot of time with my family thinking about the future and ethics climate 
of what we do we live in hope that the technical solutions to methane production from ruminants become scaleable 
i am fascinated in the human response or lack of to climate change risk we understand that the majority 
people are either too high on the hierarchy of needs to be able to respond or not well enough 
to care there must also be a component of it being too big a problem for an individual to 
they can make a difference i wonder if a good topic for one of your podcasts might be around 
way to influence the human race to take more positive actions can you help me please in that i 
a patreon supporter of the podcast but still get ads i get my podcast directly to an app on 
phone it was okay until the kitty litter ad unfortunately feral cats are a big problem in our world 
their impact on native birds and animals so unlike you i am not a great fan there should be
