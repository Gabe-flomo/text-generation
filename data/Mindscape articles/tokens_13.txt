dispatches from an uncertain world is available april click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome 
the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll we talk a lot about science on this podcast and science has 
lofty goals we try to understand the fundamental workings of nature whether at its broader scales its tiniest scales 
somewhere in between but science is also part of human life which means that there are things like politics 
human ambition that are really tied up into the actual workings of science another thing that is tied up 
the workings of science is money you need money to do science whether fairly inexpensive science like i do 
you need some travel money and some graduate student support or very very big science where you might need 
billions of dollars to do something like discover the higgs boson or detect gravitational waves sc so my guest 
is david kaiser a professor at mit and a really unique thinker in this field because he is both 
practicing physicist a theoretical cosmologist like myself he works with alan guth and other people at mit on what 
in the early universe black holes and inflation and stuff like that but also a working historian of science 
he studies especially physics in the century which was face it a gogo time for physics not only were 
great intellectual revolutions going on but once the manhattan project had come physics was the glamor science governments could 
give enough money to physicists that situation if been following along has been changing becoming harder and harder to 
money for physics in particular but arguably even for science in general sc so david one of the things 
been thinking about these days with a new book coming out is how money and politics and science physics 
particular have all intersected over the course of the century a fascinating story because the physics is interesting what 
you going to do when you have money what are you going to do when you have as much 
but also of course the human side is interesting how do you make these decisions essentially an infinite number 
interesting things you could do given world enough and time given money enough and resources but you have to 
choices about what to do so just no choice that we need to take seriously the intersection of money 
and science this is the podcast to go to if you want to know how that played out in 
century and what the implications for that are going forward sc i also want to mention i hope everyone 
doing well staying safe and keeping busy during the pandemic the coronavirus issue that all facing worldwide as i 
i think before on the podcast one of the things doing is starting a little series of youtube videos 
informal me in front of a camera kind of stuff where i talk about some of the great ideas 
physics and in science more broadly it is called the biggest ideas in the universe you can check it 
the idea is that every week going to put out a video and then people will ask questions in 
youtube comments sections or on the blog where i blog post it and then i will pick out some 
the best questions and answer them in a video a couple of days later sc so this is not 
any sense supposed to be a way to learn about the virus or pandemics or anything like that a 
to learn about the universe and i think that still important to try to learn about the universe even 
trying to live in a world that has been so dramatically changed by this kind of event important as 
say elsewhere to both keep living but also to grow and move forward this is my way of helping 
all do that i hope everyone is doing it the best way they can so with that go music 
david kaiser welcome to the mindscape podcast david kaiser thanks so much having me sc good to have you 
you have this wonderfully interdisciplinary worldlife role whatever it is at mit working physicist writer and historian am i 
anything policy person dk well not quite policy but i did just take on another nother role which is 
bit nutty now an associate dean for social and ethical responsibilities of computing sc of computing dk of computing 
have a brand new college of computing and so where i mostly wear my historian of science cap say 
can we think about science and engineering in broader context and so what i try to bring to that 
role as well sc alright so do you code laughter dk very little i have friends who code which 
like the best thing sc back in the day maybe were you dk modestly nothing close to the fancy 
today modestly sc no that was me basic quick basic on ibm pcs was my peak dk yeah and 
love mathematica shout out and maple my level anything beyond that i need friends and students fast sc so 
right to the ethical considerations for that i like that i wanted to concentrate the chat on science and 
which just saying the words out loud a slightly illfit right strange bedfellows but necessary ones definitely bedfellows maybe 
is the best place to start even when we were inventing science back in the day and bacon and 
and whatever how did they get paid those scientists did they apply for grants how did it work dk 
apply for grants in a direct way some of them were paid by a kind of local government and 
first paying gigs were working for the venetian senate or among his first and he was very crafty and 
could arrange these great demonstrations to get their attention like the telescope that he did not invent but certainly 
he basically sold it to them as a military defensive device you could see the oncoming ships quicker and 
said is great give him a one hundred scudi per year or a one thousand and that was one 
scudi really meant something dk but he was a crafty smart guy and so before long in fact within 
a year or less galileo had parlayed this to a different sort of supporter and he moved very rapidly 
be the court philosopher for the de medicis and so he moved to florence and he was set up 
an inhouse researcher but his main job was really to make the de medicis look good it was one 
bauble for court his job was to be terrifically entertaining at dinner like all the physicists and astronomers we 
today he fit perfectly in that mold so he was really very expert and it turns out he was 
no means alone kepler was imperial mathematician for a different emperor emperor i guess rudolph ii sc sorry i 
to gloss over too quickly the idea that first monetary source was defensefunded dk right sc in a sense 
goes back to archimedes right he had the same thing dk right no i want to suggest that galileo 
it either right these are really longstanding trends and what we see with galileo and really his generation is 
variety of possibilities there is literally a citystate government something like a local government sc nations were not the 
thing at the time dk not in italy in particular a little bit later in that century a couple 
decades later nation states did start making formal institutions to support research like the founding of the royal society 
the in england and the french royal academy was founded around the same time so there are some kind 
academies not quite universities really meant to be almost more like we might call them think tanks today supported 
the crown or by central governments sc research institutes dk exactly right and more often than not throughout much 
europe it was a local duchy or a local noble person in the family sc tycho brahe an example 
yep great example sc kissing up to the local nobility dk yeah got him a whole island right sc 
got an island with the various observatories built dk and lots of serfs to do a lot of work 
was sc and collected a lot of data dk and tons of data sc it was the big data 
of astronomy it was launched back then dk right yeah exactly with again with basically private funding from a 
of local royal sc so for galileo was the switch from government money to local nobility money intentional in 
sense that he said would rather be supported in this dk yes it was very much intentional he really 
very crafty so it was not only that he would get more money which he did he would lose 
teaching obligations the guy was not dumb so he was teaching at the local university and being supported by 
venetian senate in venice or padua and then when he moved to florence his job is to think grand 
all day and be very interesting at dinner sc i recently visited the galileo museum which by the way 
not a museum about galileo the museum and all their baubles and he was the greatest bauble dk he 
a great bauble sc still today the draw dk right yeah and like i say he was maybe among 
most clever or conniving of that cohort but that was really the default approach for much of what we 
now call the scientific revolution sc right but how formal was it how many scientists were there asking for 
dk a really good question hard to know this was just the time when the first things we might 
as learned journals were being founded so we can go back to libraries to particularly wellstocked libraries today and 
through rare books or rare journals but even there the notion of a professional scientist was not quite what 
today really a notion that emerges over the century sc we should say what years are galileo dk right 
big breakthrough is his famous trial with the catholic church is so that period so right contemporary with johannes 
therefore a little bit later than brahe but all in that same time period sc right and i guess 
about the same time when universities were taking off is that fair they were there already but they dk 
were there sc but they were getting bigger dk they were getting bigger they were also not usually the 
for research they were very involved with teaching often in many parts of europe teaching clergy and so they 
a different role to play the oldest universities in europe date back to the century to the so even 
a millennium before galileo so they were around there for a long time but they were not seen to 
were it was at galileo was eager to get out of a university position and become court philosopher so 
were there they were indeed growing but not the main story for a lot of science in that period 
is there any thought that either galileo or his many friends and enemies worried about this situation either the 
funding or the private funding were they already thinking about ethical considerations or like you dk yeah i think 
lot of it was you money and that person over there has even more money thank you very my 
of it there were wonderful sounding charters when we get to the nationbased societies like the royal society or 
french royal academy of sciences in paris there are these lovely ornate charters very aspirational is for the betterment 
kind of language but if you go and look at what they were mostly supporting we see a hodgepodge 
not sure that it was affecting daily practice so much it was a nice thing to say sc i 
think of poor descartes who made his money being a tutor for various princesses and ended up dying of 
because he had to move to sweden was it sweden dk i remember where he certainly had to leave 
he was in the low countries in holland for quite a while not sure where he wound up dying 
he had to get the heck out of where he had been for sure yeah sc but by the 
of newton which is soon after galileo i think of him being at cambridge university dk he was right 
as a student and then where although as you probably remember sean he got most of his most worldchanging 
done away from campus when the campus was closed because of the plague sc true dk so i always 
my own mit students do much better on spring break or over the summer listen to me sc as 
as isaac newton dk as long as not fighting the plague and as long as isaac newton two ingredients 
right so then newton did make much of his career as a professor at cambridge teaching mathematics or applied 
although even later in his own life again as you know he left that and became master of the 
he was overseeing printing of money coins mostly and he delighted in prosecuting alleged counterfeiters and cutting off fingers 
he had a nasty streak sc a terrible person dk he had a nasty streak sc but also not 
that much research by that time or at least not doing physics research he was definitely doing biblical research 
he was doing a lot of biblical research throughout and also alchemical research even experimental things and that was 
through much of the period although he did work on his optics his second major famous work of science 
think is from that later period in his career it might have overlapped a bit more sc and being 
physicist rather than a historian my history tends to skip over the entire century but one thinks of benjamin 
people like that again not university affiliated dk no right and to my mind for our beloved field sean 
lot of the work that we would look back to was being done in the century the a lot 
it in france and a lot of those folks were associated or supported by the royal academy sc royal 
okay dk some of them were based at universities but a lot of them had basically stipends to do 
work and every now and then they would compete for large prize essay contests and where a lot of 
work that we would just take for granted today by lagrange by laplace by poisson by names that we 
from our physics textbooks really the cohort who nurtured and expanded the newtonian framework just so much beyond what 
himself had ever lived to see sc i love the idea of essay contests as a way to make 
living and it continued on right poincaré very famously discovered chaos theory roughly speaking by his essay dk right 
even some of stephen most important work was submitted first as essays to the gravity research foundation a contest 
continues to this day sc i done that i think i won second place in that one year dk 
good company hawking did not always win sc no no no no dk he often got honorable mentions sc 
it has to be a pretty sad essay not to get an honorable mention in that contest i think 
there are some pretty sad essays that enter it dk chuckle could be right sc okay is this tax 
dollars in some sense that are funding the academies dk so to speak certainly coming from the royal budgets 
themselves are coming from all kinds of collections taxes and tariffs on the people so in that sense they 
statefunded by the crown when there still were crowns but it was coming from the say central bank account 
that sense it was being funded predominantly not by local industries certainly not by student fees by tuition it 
predominantly national level government expenditure by that point sc and i guess i should ask did these people think 
themselves as scientists as physicists some people thought of themselves as mathematicians even though we would now call them 
dk right so the catchall term most of them would have recognized would be which i love the sound 
that sc still true dk still true sc still great dk so again good to remember that although the 
was in the english language for a long long time the word was invented it was actually introduced into 
in the sc yeah amazing dk well after this period even of the laplaces and lagranges let alone newton 
galileo so there were words like astronomer there were words like you said natural philosopher and mathematician and one 
the things that galileo in fact wanted to do was shed the lower status title of mathematician he was 
a mathematics professor supported in part by the venetian senate but he became a philosopher that was so much 
special to him and to his generation sc those were the days dk those were the days when he 
from lowlevel mathematics lowly mathematics to being an actual court philosopher sc wow and then so i really do 
to get to the and centuries so skipping quickly but thinking of people like maxwell and boltzmann and again 
mixture of universities and big research centers the prussian academy dk right and the a time of really vast 
in the role of what we would eventually call scientists the word itself starts being used in english the 
setting the role that people are hired in to do no longer a gentlemanly pursuit now there really is 
profession you can go to school get trained and get a job as something called a scientist sc you 
tell your parents you want to grow up to be a scientist dk and be the wrong kind of 
not a medical doctor chuckle right so that really is a story of the transformation over the century so 
like maxwell were based at a university for he was at cambridge from much of his career and he 
in fact innovating even within there institutionally he becomes the founding director of the new cavendish laboratory so amazing 
he was this mathematical physicist who handed us so much of the basic theoretical physics we use day in 
day out and his big promotion was to become an experimental physicist sc the head of the lab dk 
right sc and of course the cavendish is still one of the best labs in that sense dk that 
and that was part of a move by again a national government as well as the local university but 
was part of a move toward an intentional investment in science and engineering research for national betterment often tied 
that period to imperial ambitions have better telegraphs have better ships at sea conquer so some applied projects in 
and technology for nationstate betterment or defense but not always limited narrowly to that and so there was room 
investigations that were not tied narrowly to a project but the point is that national governments now not just 
monarchs or aristocrats but actually national governments with a more articulated set of institutions they began supporting what we 
would recognize as scientific research sc was it always true even back to galileo to the extent that there 
nation states or at least local citystates people appreciated that science was helpful whether or not you call it 
natural philosophy was helpful to national greatness or was that a latecomer on the scene dk it was certainly 
useful talking point but what was a measure of national one of the best things that kepler kept doing 
keep his job was casting really good horoscopes chuckle he was a terrific astronomer and what the court wanted 
other things was advice on national affairs better consult the our astronomer they were considered useful but not always 
ways that we might expect sc okay so we move up to the century is that okay dk yup 
sc take a little bit of a detour i want to talk about einstein a little bit dk sure 
obviously he was pretty good chuckle sc he in the popular press labeled a physicist i think that he 
often called a mathematician dk right yeah there was a continuing kind of both labels would be used for 
long time sc but also he famously bounced around jobs right dk sure did yeah yeah sc and do 
want to talk about to the extent to which that was because his ideas were so radical that people 
him or just sometimes tough to find a job and everyone knew he was brilliant dk i think closer 
the latter but even there we have to add append an asterisk that not everyone knew he was brilliant 
those early years in fact made an awful lot of powerful enemies or at least people who were pretty 
by him sc he rubbed people the wrong way dk he rubbed people the wrong way he was awfully 
as a young man as was galileo in fact in that they share many things sc yeah dk and 
was quick to let professors know that not only he thought that courses were boring so he just ever 
up they were hopelessly out of date and doing unimportant things one thing to think that as sure many 
my own students probably still do about me but thankfully they tell me that to my face laughter dk 
had no such problems of saying professor weber this is just a waste of time see sc and he 
have been right he had a point dk and he might not have been wrong every time but although 
course as you know sometimes it came back to bite him so he cut his math classes and then 
to to fifteen years later comes crawling back to his friends who had taken the classes whose notes he 
borrowed laughter dk and said gosh it turns out really important to me sc yeah for money and stuff 
need to know dk right so even there sometimes it came back to bite him sc and but again 
his career was spent at universities one way or the other dk not right away but he even actually 
sure true his first job paying gig out of his university studies is as a patent clerk he was 
as a patent clerk third class as i always say there was no fourth class laughter dk this was 
job he got it not based on any merits because the father of one of his close buddies pulled 
strings even for einstein it what you know who you know very sobering he dives into the work as 
as we can tell been fascinated by electric gadgets as a kid this is the age of electrification he 
recalls when an uncle gives him a compass when really young this is just mindboggling and both his father 
his uncle were early kind of electrical engineers who kept failing at business though they seemed to be pretty 
as engineers so einstein i think he necessarily saw this as a bad place to start i think he 
kind of these gadgets he worked closely with experimentalists through the many parts of his career and tinkered with 
so he starts sc and peter galison makes the point pretty dk right sc that his work with clocks 
became important dk yeah exactly with the real machinery of coordinating clocks across a distance right exactly i love 
book that peter wrote so immersed in this electrotechnical modern era as a patent inspector he publishes these basically 
submits these four articles in only in the space of six months of we call one thousand nine hundred 
his miracle year it was his miracle season laughter dk the guy took half a year really just six 
sc well by the way likewise newton right he invent all of classical mechanics over that break when they 
had the plague dk yeah he was awfully quick right but unlike einstein newton sat on it for decades 
that had to be pulled from him from these unpublished notes einstein was publishing these things so we know 
can date them and so on we know when they were received at the journal by and large but 
these things come out of and the response from his employer is not even to promote him he even 
promoted to patent clerk second class laughter dk and no reading most of these articles for years so his 
academic gig is basically about four years later an entry level position at an out of the way university 
few years later poached somewhere else at a marginally less out of the way university he moves around three 
four times in the space of five years and then in spring of yeah sc sorry both because he 
gaining more renown and also he was a climber he wanted to be at these bigger places dk exactly 
a great point sean we have housed indeed at caltech this amazing international effort to publish and edit collected 
his correspondence both incoming and outgoing an amazing team led by just a terrific historian diana buchwaldkormos and so 
can watch thanks to that help this daybyday grappling with hard ideas dealing with a marriage souring very tragically 
then also indeed a kind of social academic climber to be sure we have that going on over the 
of not quite a decade in the patent office really unknown and nine years later he gets the call 
call is not to do more teaching the not to a university post instead to become a member of 
prussian academy of sciences where he have to teach and he gets resources to conduct research and his job 
to think and when he leaves that when he basically refuses to return to germany after hitler takes power 
years later in einstein hops ship to the institute for advanced study in princeton which is also not a 
where again he does no teaching sc technically not a university true dk no formal classes sc very closely 
to it yeah dk no affiliated with princeton university sc right dk but he was not grading papers late 
the night he formally teaching sc caltech tried very hard to get him dk yes right sc i know 
much of that story you know dk yeah some but yeah sc but he loved los angeles and hollywood 
loved hobnobbing with the stars and what told not sure how much on the record or verifiable this is 
the final straw was just that president was so antisemitic that einstein put up with it and he complained 
antisemitism at princeton but caltech was just too much dk yeah and unfortunately again as we now know caltech 
more in the mainstream of american universities elite universities than the exception at that point so another a similar 
from right around that time the late when j robert oppenheimer was first hitting the academic market very young 
skipped grades in high school graduated harvard in three years he was taking phd level courses in physics his 
year as an undergraduate one of those people zooms off to europe for his phd and is and a 
postdoc and snatched up by both berkeley and caltech for tenure track which is effectively almost tenured positions and 
berkeley department chair had to fight to get him appointed they already had one jew on the faculty laughter 
circa sc the quota had been filled dk right and so they make an exception for this indeed exceptional 
but the point is that the antisemitism in hiring and indeed in student admissions was pretty rampant across the 
states hardly unique to caltech then but it did indeed affect some of own positive opportunities sc so at 
point in this process does the idea of applying for grants appear is that something that is coming on 
scene at the time dk not in the way recognize it no a lot of this research was sc 
we should explain to the audience who are not all professional physicists what it means to apply for grants 
not everyone knows about that is that not how we all spend our time yeah so really in recent 
and indeed in recent decades the way the vast majority of scientific research is supported in the united states 
now really commonly in many many parts of the world is that researchers will submit a grant proposal i 
propose to do the following investigations why i think important what i expect to be able to find need 
much time and this much money over that time and you submit that to a variety of kinds of 
either a federal agency in the united states the national science foundation department of energy nasa national institutes of 
and so on or increasingly like maybe we can come back to in this conversation increasingly to private foundations 
on some occasions to individual private donors usually or indeed to a private industry a corporation or a kind 
industrial laboratory so you say if you can give me this money i can do this work on this 
not so to speak for you but i pledge to do this project as best as i can over 
years sc maybe national greatness will be enhanced chuckle dk and then come back with hat in hand really 
and so a contract basis meaning so for universitybased researchers like you and me our home universities will on 
behalf in the formal contractual sense we submit a proposal to our local university their main office checks it 
okay it looks right then they will submit it for example to the national science foundation be a whole 
of peer review and priorities will be hashed out congratulations mit we will now fund this proposal from researcher 
whatever my code might be not my code but anyways from your local researcher and then the money will 
transferred to the university and then eventually i could spend it to hire a student or some modest equipment 
on the model of coequal business partners not a charity not cast as a charity not a gift which 
different from before from yeah longer ago in history it is we have two autonomous agents sc and very 
yeah dk very legalistic extremely formalized exactly right and not just in the accounting but in the language allowed 
this agreement a legal contract and with all the headaches that that might imply sc just to illustrate you 
travel to a conference and pay for your hotel using a grant money but there is a limit on 
many dollars per night you can spend doing that dk right and charge alcohol to it which is perfectly 
not things like that there are limits on what it could be spent on and how much per category 
that has been really spelled out and often if you want to change the allotments oh i need to 
another trip to vienna to meet with my colleagues but i only budgeted this much for international travel and 
negotiation the current process and it really was put in place not in day not even in day that 
from the second world war pretty recent in history and it was engineered literally engineered by an mit researcher 
kind of administrator named vannevar bush he had been dean of engineering here he helped found raytheon corporation in 
he was basically an electrical engineer and his real brilliance was really in administration he was tapped by franklin 
even before the united states had formally entered the second world war bush became the person in charge on 
to organize science and engineering for defense for the sort of clearly soon to be defense effort even before 
surprise attack on pearl harbor sc we admitted that we were in the war yeah dk there was a 
of a preparation going on and bush was really one of the chief engineer architects of that dk related 
our presidents bush sc i think there was no relation same spelling but no i think any direct connections 
i know of and so bush essentially like many of the kind of elite university administrators of that time 
a lot of especially private universities many of them were very strongly antinew deal they think the federal government 
be moving into education now look that smelled of central planning so they thought that the federal government had 
business in the job of education they be involved in universities so there were failed efforts before the second 
war for example here at mit and other places to actually get federal support for research on campus and 
would just sort of fizzle out that was not the template that was not the model dk that changes 
rapidly in the early and so bush want to have even the appearance of a kind what smelled to 
too much of a kind of socialism fairly or unfairly what he thought this would lead to he said 
a business contract have a private sector model free market kind of model two autonomous agents will enter into 
binding legal agreement the federal government needs us we need them two parties come to the table we hash 
a deal a contract and that becomes the kind of grant the basis for grant making that ramps up 
an unbelievable rate during the second world war and really never slows down or slow down for a long 
time for decades afterwards here in the us and that quickly becomes kind of exported as a model to 
research many places beyond the united states sc world war ii clearly changed everything about science and money and 
think that if you told the person on the street that that was true they would agree with you 
they would attribute it all to the manhattan project and atomic bombs but it goes far further than that 
it really does and this is a fascinating period of history and written about it and continually kind of 
amazed by it so both the radar projects the allied efforts in radar very quickly were shifted to be 
here at mit and the manhattan project which was much more sprawling that wound up having more than thirty 
across both the united states and canada with large inputs from the british and canadian contingents dk so it 
los alamos it was three dozen sites contracting sites some very large those were incredibly important examples of this 
relationship between the federal government and particularly the military those kind of war department as it was then called 
often universitybased researchers physicists chemists engineers of many many stripes metallurgists linguists social scientists as well in some of 
projects but that right not even the biggest story by some ways to measure there was an even more 
effort starting even before the manhattan project was kind of scaling up for a different kind of partnership with 
with science and that was to train lots of people in rudimentary physics sc yeah dk and i found 
really fascinating after world war ii the phrase was used all the time and people would use it to 
to radar but especially the nuclear weapons project to los alamos and the bombs and how the term gets 
of reinterpreted people would say a very quick reminder world war i was the war we had poison gas 
so on world war ii was the war because of these kinds of projects and they mean almost always 
and the bomb it turns out the usage of the phrase as we can now tell by tools like 
ngrams we can search huge corpi of english language text that the usage of the word spikes while the 
project is barely existing and still classified while radar is slightly bigger and still classified sc so the people 
the street know that these things are going on dk right these newspaper editors are not spilling secrets they 
know about them they used the term to refer as it was used routinely in congressional testimony and it 
in the public face a lot in the early years of world war ii but it meant this massive 
program to train often could have enlisted soldiers service members across the various branches of the military in really 
physics then modern battlefield meant you had to know something about electronics and circuits and radio for kind of 
communication something like sound ranging how do sound waves propagate through a battlefield so i know that the sniper 
was from here and not there how do you measure humidity and angles and basic atmospheric conditions dk it 
what we would consider kind of really high school level physical sciences it was certainly not esoteric nuclear physics 
was being really rapidly sought and this remade many many american campuses there was a huge push to get 
members onto campus for short very very intense sevenday a week many hours per day instruction in basic physics 
was called the physicists war the first academic specialty that started getting draft deferments were physicists not so they 
make weapons so they would stay in the classroom people who were in math everything from mathematics to music 
philosophy faculty were kind of drafted not drafted in the formal military sense were grabbed on so they could 
teach rudimentary physics to these enormous auditorium fulls of enlisted service members so that became the war dk that 
modern battlefield needs what we would now call classical physics and we need hundreds of thousands of people to 
cognizant of these things so just it remakes physics it remakes large parts of the university and it really 
this increasingly close working relationship between the federal government including the war department the military and defense branches and 
research sc do you know the story of the caltech football team dk tell me not sure i do 
caltech is not a sports powerhouse in the ncaa in any stretch but if you go to the gym 
little plaque that put that mentions that the i know what it is caltech football team is in the 
sports hall of fame and an explanation if you go online the explanation is the following there was no 
at caltech but during the war people basically a whole bunch of army soldiers who had been training at 
or something like that were moved to caltech to train in caltech they wanted to play football caltech have 
team so that they hurriedly put together a schedule which consisted of two games against the university of redlands 
one game each against usc and ucla jv teams dk right sc and so these soldiers destroyed their competitors 
like in four games the total score was two hundred thirty to and such a showman show of bad 
got them into the ncaa hall of fame for being one of the best football teams of all time 
well congratulations sc yeah i know dk you and your students will be very proud i did not know 
story fantastic but and it all adds up a great example of these campuses were really overrun at mit 
few years into this project there were three basically enlisted service members on campus for every two ordinary students 
were more people in these special army and navy courses across campus than ordinary college students also why a 
of campuses switched to a trimester or a quarter system got to squeeze more stuff in a shorter amount 
time a war on buddy that kind of mentality it really has an just an amazing impact on campuses 
on the structure of american higher education sc did it change the appearance of physics in the curriculum for 
students dk oh yeah it the emphasis was basically get through this again we might think of high school 
stuff because half the high schools in the united states offering any physics at all it sort of astonished 
began to realize so a lot of it was pretty rudimentary there were expert panels advising groups like both 
war department and the office of education the federal office of education during the war panels of universitybased physicists 
of the american institute of physics would help staff these kind of blue ribbon committees and they explicitly argued 
departments should not offer useless material like nuclear physics during the war again in hindsight because that will take 
too many resources too many classroom hours away from what the campus needed to fulfill dk there were all 
formulas that anyone who was seen as poaching legitimate physics instructors if getting a music professor to go teach 
they really want to get all hands on deck so to the extent that university might be jockeying to 
some hot shot from another campus there would be come in for very strict get a very strict talking 
if you are disrupting this emergency physics instruction sc so if i graduated from a good university or college 
the is it likely that i would never have had any physics in either high school or university or 
dk yeah if you were not a physical sciences student yes right so there were something i remember the 
exactly something like half the high schools or half the high school age children or students were getting zero 
instruction at all on the eve of the war yeah right and on the other hand you had people 
oppenheimer coming up who had so much physics as a student that he could jump right ahead in harvard 
clearly this was unevenly distributed as so many things remain in education sc so clearly an enormous amount of 
flooded into physics during the war but then it go away dk right right and so after the very 
revealing of the presence of these bombs and they were revealed in a horribly destructive way by using them 
the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in early august that by that point physics was on lips tied 
to these amazing or unusual or unexpected weapons and another really kind of amazing irony of history that happens 
we now know many historians have looked in detail at this and scientists of many stripes what kinds of 
did it take to build these nuclear weapons during the second world war certainly needed some physics it needed 
lot of chemistry chemical engineering metallurgy electrical engineering and the list is very long dk some of the most 
experts associated with the project were physicists robert oppenheimer hans bethe head of the theory division of los alamos 
so on but a lot of it was incredibly complicated work by dupont chemical engineers scalingup reactors and making 
they would produce plutonium they kept not working for us sc not so much biology but these days there 
be a much larger biological component as well dk right that was much less significantly represented in the middle 
the second world war it would begin to change after the war right but however there was an effort 
control what could be said about nuclear weapons once they were used so in real time during the war 
leslie groves who was the army general in charge of the entire manhattan project he commissioned a physics colleague 
henry dewolf smyth who was a nuclear physicist been department head at princeton a very elite welltrained nuclear physicist 
he recruited smyth not to work as a nuclear physicist on the bomb project but to work as a 
reporter as a kind of realtime historian of the project he was given the appropriate clearance and his job 
to visit many of these sites los alamos oak ridge hanford and many of the even smaller sites throughout 
war to write a report on how the weapon was designed and built that could be cleared and safe 
release ahead of time so that they accidentally revealing the socalled secrets of atomic bombs the atomic secret and 
they knew be an enormous need for information for the press sc so tell a story but not the 
story dk exactly right sc so they figured out what they could tell dk right and so it turns 
that this is where the first nuclearbased classification codes are actually literally codified what can smyth include in his 
even after years after the war if in the smyth report you can publish it if not it is 
facto born classified sc yeah dk so what do they decide is safe enough to release in fact the 
even say that at the time secret rules that govern this report information can only be released in the 
if already widely known to professional scientists and in the published literature or if it has no significant bearing 
the construction of atomic weapons what meets that test a lot of nuclear physics had very little to do 
how these things were actually made it was either so widely known that the cat was out of the 
or literally it was just not the stuff that people thought was most needed to be kind of locked 
which really was how do you get uranium hexafluoride this horribly corrosive gas not to eat through your metal 
in these filtration systems how do you stop the huge reactors at hanford from selfpoisoning so you can actually 
plutonium out instead of having the reactions kind of halt how do you get subcritical chunks of these very 
materials to get imploded together very very supersonic speeds which was not at all obvious they struggled with that 
the war dk all of these are are only barely physics problems and those things we said ever let 
stuff so the irony is the smyth report comes out and it looks like physicists built the bomb because 
smyth report is filled with ideas about elementary quantum theory and nuclear physics and i should say this is 
that really first came to light by a terrific historian named rebecca press schwartz and others historians including myself 
have followed that trail since then so another one of these we all think we know going on oh 
physicists war oh bombs were made by physicists nukes and say actually gosh it gets pretty complicated pretty quickly 
a lot of engineering and things that they chose not to tell us about dk and how did we 
to tell that story is itself part of the story sc but i guess a little bit of a 
from our selfchosen theme but since we all all of us probably listening here have all of our lives 
about nuclear weapons kind of hard to imagine what it would have been like just not only we have 
really big bomb but we have a really big bomb because of something about the laws of physics dk 
sc right this new insight it just we took the bomb that we had and made it bigger there 
this way of doing things we thought of that must have been a little scary dk it was scary 
i think right and yet in the earliest moments if we judge by a lot of the popular media 
in newspapers and magazines it was often combined with a kind of gee whiz it was wrapped around a 
of the scientists by which they almost always at that point meant the physicists have conquered the forces of 
conquered the reactions that drive the sun of course they doing fusion weapons yet that came a few years 
but the language they would use they captured cosmic forces and now we can make them do our bidding 
that sounded not just like physics was relevant it seemed like physics was the most important thing literally in 
universe and that again has this an immediate kind of unintended effect throughout especially usbased higher education the spillover 
we can trace in many other parts of the world as well so that enrollments in physics departments grow 
at a rate twice as fast as all fields combined dk it just races ahead more and more people 
to go into physics then ever before classrooms are bulging now not with service members who need rudimentary physics 
with very smart people who say going to work on the forces of nature on these cosmic mysteries and 
projects funding is now accelerating at a riproaring pace for physics even more ironically than for some of those 
fields that really were so important for applied military projects and so one of the things looked at for 
a while is the kind of growth rates for enrollments for funding for job opportunities but also even if 
step away from the countables from our excel spreadsheets and just think about the cultural place of the physicists 
the years right after the second world war dk one example i love there was a private by invitation 
little meeting for roughly maybe two dozen handselected physicists in roughly two years after end of the war on 
island off the north fork of long island this was a meeting sean probably close to your hearts where 
first began figuring out how to use quantum field theories and make calculations that always lead to sc taming 
infinities normalization yeah dk incredibly important the first successful answers were reported at the next one in that series 
in people were learning about brand new experiments that just seemed so you had to pay attention to them 
so names like hans bethe and richard feynman and julian schwinger dk julian schwinger exactly right and willis lamb 
isidor rabi present some of these newest experimental findings that really kind of electrify the group brought together largely 
robert oppenheimer who by this point has left his berkeley position moved now to be director of the institute 
advanced study now boss as the press would love to say it and he gets government money to convene 
very elite group for a kind of retreat where go think about the mysteries of the quantum realm together 
how to describe matter in this quantum mechanical way the reason i bring this up is that they met 
the american institute of physics headquarters in manhattan which was at the time in manhattan to take a kind 
rickety school bus off to long island dk and midway along their journey they pick up a police escort 
someone says hey a bunch of physicists in that van those are the ones who won the war for 
why such and such have the us have to mount a land invasion of japan and all these stories 
were circulating those are physicists another booster or kind of recent veteran along the way stops the bus and 
on buying a steak dinner for all of those but what starts to happen another physicist kind of bemused 
surprised physicists around that same time who writes that every dinner party it needs physicists paraded around the luncheon 
in washington dc among the socialites even people who had no role in the wartime projects the job description 
physicists suddenly meant something very different than it ever had before and as i always remind my students my 
example comes from magazine in the late where an observer writes that no dinner party is a success without 
least one physicist sc we can all agree on that dk i said sc we probably discovered that fact 
yeah and yet and look at us now sc still not invited to the best dinner parties dk my 
right but the moment of that real cultural shift sc one of the interesting features of this is physicists 
play a very big role in the combat operations in world war ii and the technology behind them that 
them access afterward for decades afterward to a whole bunch of money but the money narrowly focused on military 
those people in the bus going to shelter island were normalizing quantum electrodynamics there were zero applications for that 
right certainly none that they had in mind at the time absolutely right and another thing that i found 
curious when i dug in and was doing some more investigating wearing my cap so the overarching policy that 
form very rapidly in this chaotic postworld war ii period was that we need to keep funding basic research 
the sciences and by which they almost always meant physics more than any others rightly or incorrectly fairly or 
science often meant physics to these folks really quick slippage we need them not make better widgets or gadgets 
military devices but so be on call we want to make what they themselves would often call a standing 
we want to have the greatest pool of talent we want to make sure that they are technically proficient 
have the best equipment in the universe to hone their skills on even if not using that equipment right 
and now to make better military applications dk so that if the cold war turns hot if a new 
phase of fighting were to break out they spend all that time staffing up the next manhattan project not 
would they be there the us government would know who they were where they were already be paying them 
be on the payroll efforts to make a national registry of physicists kick in in this point not sort 
for surveillance purposes but to say we need to know where our technical experts are if and when we 
them and that prevails for nearly a quarter century that assumption leads to an enormous enormous kind of rocketing 
amount of funding and enrollments follow suit and job opportunities grow even faster so that sc well you used 
phrase cold war the point right dk yeah sc world war ii ended but the fact that there was 
the cold war going on there was clearly this technological race made explicit in the space race but a 
broader one that absolutely fed into the idea that we need to keep throwing money at physics dk absolutely 
remember even long before sputnik or the space race a lot of people were very concerned about the proliferation 
nuclear weapons as many people are even to this day but at that point the united states had a 
even that statement is not quite right the manhattan project had been a threecountry partnership with the united states 
and canada one would have thought had a tripleopoly or whatever although very rapidly relations soured even there so 
became really a us project and relations were strained nonetheless no other nation state literally possessed these things after 
war and all the projections seemed to suggest that the soviet union which was rapidly emerging as the presumptive 
or enemy as the cold war really set in many many policy makers in the united states convinced themselves 
a backward people failing even at agriculture those horrible disasters of collective farming a backward rural people not able 
do this sort of gleaming hightech science and technology and of course that was really proven to be untrue 
basically four years dk so by late august the soviets had detonated their own atomic weapon with some kind 
complicated role played by espionage but a lot of it was we again historians and scientists have gone back 
these things once many documents became available after the fall of the soviet union not that this was a 
copy of the american bomb there was a lot of hard work major expenditures trial and error nonetheless this 
of highly trained experts in the soviet union produced what the united states was confident would only ever be 
the united states and then that triggers this arms race soon it was felt that that each country needed 
just more weapons but weapons of greater explosive power and then of course a whole different means of making 
reactions release lots of energy meaning switching from fission bombs of the sort that had been used and developed 
the war to fusion bombs that really do harness reactions more like what go on in the inside of 
sun sc from the sun yeah dk yeah and that is just a kind of drumbeat kind of terrifying 
of activity from the late right through really much in the even before sputnik and space race and rockets 
and scientists are always happy to take the money if going to be out there but there must have 
some awkward rubbing of shoulders just because the culture of academia and intellectual freedom of speech free trade free 
of ideas is a little bit different than a more closedminded secretive military mindset dk right right and it 
a kind of culture clash from the earliest days of the manhattan project of los alamos in particular and 
was again famously kind of thought out duped out by robert oppenheimer who was the physicist and was the 
director of wartime los alamos who had to work very closely with leslie groves the army general who was 
in charge of the whole project groves favored a policy of very strict compartmentalization so one should only ever 
access to the information that you genuinely need for your own part of this large project you compartmentalize the 
so no individual has access to too many things that was seen to be dangerous dk and that clearly 
there was therefore huge restrictions on communication even among fellow scientific experts on the same project let alone in 
larger community oppenheimer won a kind of early battle with groves by getting groves to agree that people with 
right kind of seniority the right kind of literally colored badge at wartime los alamos could attend a colloquium 
inhouse still kind of classified open only to those that rather modest group so at least they could brainstorm 
kind of problemshoot things together and not only be separated into separate compartments dk even that was kind of 
hardfought battle it won oppenheimer tremendous accolades from his fellow scientists on the mesa and groves gave in a 
bit but that was really that did not become the model for the project or indeed for much work 
would go on in the years to come so that one of the great concerns that starts unfolding at 
like mit and many many universities after world war ii is not only is so much of this research 
funded by the military branch as defenserelated branches of the federal government sometimes students are writing theses based on 
information so who could even serve on a committee is suddenly not so straightforward could the university library stock 
copy of the thesis chuckle dk a big question for a university and so there was a period of 
we could say transition but it was a kind of live issue it was fraught for one or two 
and it really comes to a head in the later so twenty years later people fight over it it 
quite gets resolved until the escalation of fighting in the vietnam war and that leads to just a tremendous 
of rethink of the military role in us higher education after the you find many many many universities adopting 
of them for the first time policies that say will accept defense department dollars but under these conditions students 
be able to publish their a renegotiation of secrecy information sharing freedom of expression sc they still wanted the 
laughter sc yes unfortunately that was the same time when a lot of that money was beginning to dry 
sc well also true people are still surprised when i sometimes tell them that through my life as a 
physicist much of my grant money has been from the department of energy because they think that like oil 
nuclear power and i understand what you do for a living but not that and this is part of 
historical development the national science foundation but actually not what funds most of high energy physics including string theory 
cosmology dk right yup let alone big instruments like huge equipment but even people like you and me who 
mostly with pencils and some modest computer work like we were saying before so the department of energy historically 
the kind of third wave successor to the manhattan project now of course this change does have the same 
of job description as it once did but the order of events is basically the manhattan project is founded 
the early is established in the early in secret at first soon after the end of the war starting 
in there is the establishment of a civilian agency a nominally civilian agency called the atomic energy commission or 
aec meant to take over the wartime manhattan project it was a big fight should it continue being a 
project or a civilian one and basically the kind of compromise was it would be a civilian one with 
heavy input from the military i mean more than just kind of liaison but so nominally the war departments 
the manhattan project becomes a civilian federal agency called the atomic energy commission then basically in the early briefly 
erda dk i think that was something like energy research and development agency and then quickly renamed yet again 
department of energy so we really can trace an unbroken line between the wartime manhattan project and the doe 
again the role of the doe the department of energy has continued to expand and more not just the 
manhattan project by any stretch but nonetheless it inherits that legacy and so that includes a lot of the 
at national laboratories some of it now explicitly for defence research and a lot of it now for unclassified 
kind of basic research sc but all good things come to an end laughter dk yes right sc there 
only individual grants were booming in this era but it was a period of tremendous discovery in fundamental physics 
were popping up all the time right and so starting in the both the cold war winds down and 
discoveries dry up so what happened dk well a lot of things happen so the cold war in hindsight 
know quite end in but it sure looked like it might there was a moment of what came to 
detente a kind a ratcheting back at least of some of the rhetoric and it felt like a hairtrigger 
of tension and there was a moment of kind of reset in ussoviet relations as we know that then 
back up into a more hostile or antagonistic framework even by the early but there was a moment there 
a moment in the there where different priorities started to take hold at a kind of national policymaking level 
that coincided with a real economic downturn so a period of what is often called stagflation so you have 
growth and rising unemployment together with rising inflation so given a dollar would buy you less and less over 
and economists think those two things would go together sc yeah people thought you either had unemployment or inflation 
right so this was a new or at least an unanticipated phenomenon and it really settled in hard it 
a very dismal time economically and what that meant was universities and especially universitybased physicists were hit with a 
whammy starting in the early major cutbacks in defense spending part of it is because of policy shifts the 
of cold war priorities are now being reevaluated and is combined with huge cutbacks in federal funding for education 
because the economy is just not doing well then the oil shocks and a tremendously disrupting time in the 
and many parts of the world economically sc the were kind of a drag for many reasons dk the 
was just not more of the same people were flocking to universities before then often flocking still to fields 
physics and then a lot of them got there and felt a bit like the the rug had been 
out in the decade after the launch of sputnik so between the late and the late the number of 
that offered phds in physics had doubled in the united states it really was still a growth phase we 
more more more more more and then we have this enormous glut in the country and the bottom falls 
so much so that by one thousand nine hundred sixtyeight there are many more young phds in physics seeking 
than there are jobs available or at least advertised dk and then by the bottom has just falled out 
american institute of physics kept statistics they ran a kind of clearing house to match up young physicists applying 
jobs and potential employers and by their own records by one thousand nine hundred seventyone there were more than 
thousand young phds registered for interviews who wanted interviews and fiftythree jobs on offer that fiftythree university jobs that 
jobs at government labs industrial labs they all kind of cratered together largely because more than any other field 
the academy physics had gotten sort of hooked on a single source of support in the quarter century after 
second world war things had worked with the aec who were its close partners in the federal government and 
federal funding kind of shook when that pattern became disrupted physics had nowhere to go but down chemists had 
century of experience partnering with industries and so on their funding went down their student enrollments went down but 
as kind of cataclysmic sc they were diversified dk they were diversified biologists some of them are just beginning 
would become an accelerating trend of biotechnology again it kind we might say a diversified portfolio to speak a 
anachronistically there were varieties of ways of supporting very expensive research in other fields and physics had just never 
out of that kind of single source model so physics enrollments had grown faster than any other field after 
war ii they crashed more quickly more dramatically than any other field in the early really just breathtakingly symmetrical 
but yeah the economy picked up in the and yet physics still began to feel the squeeze a little 
there i know that you and i were both around in our formative years for the superconducting super collider 
of disaster was that an omen you think dk oh yeah it sc maybe tell people what the disaster 
dk at i will so the superconducting super collider was an enormous particle accelerator that was under construction it 
proposed and actually the funding was approved by the us congress in the under the reagan administration it was 
to the design specs were that it would be not only the largest of its kind but it would 
dwarfed even the best machines on earth to this day and this was being proposed thirty years ago more 
thirty years ago it was a terrifically ambitious project sc so the ssc would have been much higher energy 
the large hadron collider which all so proud of right dk exactly sc that discovered the higgs dk if 
ever met its design specs by like a factor of three it really would have been substantially more higher 
and also more intensity more interactions per fraction of a second and this was seen as a a great 
more than a lifeline this was seen as the future of the field exactly the time when you and 
were young students and what happened was the project kept getting more and more expensive exceeding even the earlier 
estimates and much more important the cold war ended the soviet union dissolved the berlin wall comes down in 
soviet union itself dissolves quite surprisingly or unexpectedly for many observers in the united states that dissolves in and 
the kind of selfevident reason to spend money on esoteric unapplied fundamental physics like is there a higgs boson 
what are the fundamental forces of nature the reason to do that no longer is supportable or supported by 
majority of members of congress sc which is weird because it was never the right reason to do it 
right i was talking about this recently with some colleagues in europe and they were like in the world 
the cold war have anything to do with funding sc anything to do with that dk and such a 
focus it was for me like would you not know oh so it really goes back to a tradition 
stems right back to the immediate aftermath of the second world war early in the and the federal government 
fund duplicate machines the sses of their day they as radically expensive but they were big expensive infrastructure projects 
make these particle accelerators their own scientific advisory board would say only need one we need and say but 
morale the word they used was morale the physicists and make sure we can train that many more graduate 
such delicate snowflakes they are dk build right yes exactly right so the federal government paid for more stuff 
even the physicists sometimes asked for in the late early when the us entered the korean war in the 
was make more graduate fellowships for students in the atomic energy commission made a calculation in one thousand nine 
fiftyone while the us is at war in the korean conflict saying this is a near quotation from their 
from memory but pretty close they say n nuclear physicists are willing and able to use a particle accelerator 
if a reasonable team is five people per machine just build the appropriate number n over five until the 
right not until they learn more about deuterons right until the dk and this was seen as not making 
it was seen as aiding this training mission well the argument that no longer holds any water by the 
the number comes up you know sean we were both in cambridge massachusetts around that time i think we 
so when the final vote in congress to kill the funding came up it was october i remember that 
entered grad school to study highenergy physics in september of so i think it was personal slight on my 
but it really it sc the best planning perhaps on your behalf dk if only known then what i 
now and so it really was this dramatic dislocation in fact that one vote to cancel funding for this 
dollar project the vote in meant that in one year the federal budget for the entire field of highenergy 
fell in half sc yeah no i was just beginning my postdoc here at mit that year and we 
in the boston area had a town hall meeting where it was mostly therapeutic screaming and not a lot 
good planning like are we going to dk yeah and it again with hindsight it was a remarkable replay 
what had already happened in our in our own memory in the generation older than us because this is 
similar to what happened in the early this enormous cratering where the projections had been need more and more 
be unlimited funding and unlimited and of course not sustainable it crashed seemingly all of a sudden around it 
seemingly all of a sudden in the early sc europe did manage to build the large hadron collider and 
united states sort of sheepishly bought in and gave some money as a junior partner in some sense but 
days the united states has more or not even trying to build the next great particle accelerator europe and 
are vying for the rights and probably what this could be like for the foreseeable future dk if anyone 
can even do it right it certainly be in the united states i think that much we can bet 
with some certainty now there really curious at that just a year before the ssc was cancelled the federal 
now a different branch the national science foundation rather than the department of energy but the nsf in began 
substantial funding for what would become ligo a major a project that required major infrastructure sc the gravitationalwave observatory 
the laser interferometric gravitationalwave observatory ligo which sort of paid off scientifically decades later thrillingly thank goodness but think 
it a quarter century of a foresight to say will invest civilian tax dollars at the roughly billion dollar 
over the course of sc something that by the way will never result in a gravitywave bomb dk it 
not result in a gravitywave bomb sc zero technological direct applications dk although i have to say sean many 
my very dear friends and colleagues have worked on that for most of their careers here at mit sc 
doing gravitational waves not gravitationalwave bombs dk sorry i should thank you for correcting i mean to say gravitational 
of the amazingly fascinating and nondestructive sort right so gravity waves and in the when before the funding came 
in any sustained way some people would they would add sentences almost out of habit i assume to their 
proposals saying the way along the way we might find lessons of possible military they mean the gravitational waves 
weaponized they meant be learning more about electronics computing sc lasers dk lasers there could be spinoffs along the 
even if that was by no means the reason to do it so a marker again of how did 
justify spending for even openended basic research there was a kind of template in the us that was frankly 
never what took hold after the second world war for all kinds of reasons not the cern model it 
cern was meant to be instead something to kinda heal the wounds of europe sc cern the european nuclear 
particle physics laboratory dk right the center now based in geneva but multinational from the start and it was 
very early on bringing together representatives from countries that did not otherwise were not always close allies and had 
have a very bright red line demarcating anything that could possibly be construed as military relevance from this multinational 
science laboratory so the cern model was never hooked up in quite the same way to cold war politics 
priorities and the us model had been remarkably effective with some waves i mean not in an unbroken way 
over the better part of half a century and that number came up sc right dk in our early 
laughter sc and part of the narrative around this is that the century was the century of physics and 
century is the century of biology and biology is not only visceral and we all have it dk right 
right sc not all of us think about physics but we all think about biology every year a little 
more right dk right sc but also the individual biology projects are generally much cheaper than the individual big 
projects dk right even the biggest big biology projects some of which would get big the human genome project 
hardly an inexpensive project but when you look at just baseline appropriations they were not the same in fact 
one of the things that the physicist began to learn a little bit late to the error or our 
is that by the time we got to the projects like the superconducting super collider with an eight billion 
tag then maybe it would rise even to fifteen billion it so clear now competing with the kinds of 
items that make members of congress really notice not rounding error not hidden in some boring document from some 
agency right if you adjust for inflation if you adjust for the buying power of a us dollar like 
times more expensive than the hoover dam dk now approaching the cost of things like designing and building the 
in the second world war at a level of major military projects of major civil society projects of infrastructure 
that then becomes a big target for people to look at more skeptically maybe appropriately so but scaled up 
i think a lot of people in the physics profession quite realize the shift of what it would mean 
be arguing in what was no longer a blank check era for that kind of price tag projects it 
was no longer sc well everyone in congress loved the ssc until they decided where they were going to 
it chuckle dk right and there was it was not going to pay off in fifty states or many 
but once site selection was completed right but even beyond that the argument that locked in an existential battle 
the soviets well no soviet union we at all costs we need super smart trained physical scientists well because 
and so the kinds of arguments that had worked really over and over again for generations the arguments make 
and the price tag was so much larger than before that it just going it just crashed sc and 
a science point worth making here is not just that we like building bigger and bigger accelerators there are 
kinds of science that can only be done that way so not a matter of if you pay half 
money for the accelerator you get half the dk no right sc you pay half the money for the 
you get nothing and so the question is and a perfectly good question is it worth doing this kind 
science at all if the entry fee dk yeah it is a good question a question that physicists need 
grapple with and of course many people beyond physics no only up to us and that was again made 
dramatically clear so one thing that happens is there are these massive disruptions like the cancellation of the ssc 
can have unintended intellectual consequences as well as some demographic ones who goes on who gets the grant who 
can get a job those are easier to relate to these bigbudget shifts there are shifts in the kind 
world of ideas as well and that really fascinates me both as a physicist and as a historian dk 
one of the things that begins to happen both in the crash of the and again in the crash 
the crash in funding and so on is that some very very very smart particle physicists high energy physicists 
shifting their question base asking questions in for example astrophysics in a way that simply common for them to 
before the not common in the united states or to biophysics or to other kind of hybrid areas or 
matter sc one of the very first mindscape guests was jeffrey west who very dk great example sc literally 
the ssc was cancelled said not doing this he had been a particle physicist he became a complexity theorist 
actually is way more influential and successful as a complexity theorist than he was as a particle theorist dk 
and again sometimes have these kind of happy endings with hindsight sure feel like an easy transition at the 
sure an example that i find really fascinating close to my own heart and hopefully to yours is the 
of this field called particle cosmology which is an amazing wonderful exciting super terrific field i say that i 
my work in it so it must be true but that really was that was a kind of unintended 
again most of the united states at the time of this kind of just huge reversal fortunes in the 
field particle physics was hit harder than any other subfield in the early again funding was cut by in 
short window much like what happened again in the and so you see this kind of intellectual migration first 
that happens is many people leave grad school and get a job one kind of effect just grinding doubledigit 
rates for phd scientists in the and again in the not effective policy sc we had a physics colloquium 
harvard when i was a grad student there how to get a job on wall street dk yeah yeah 
right and so when i was in grad school two years after the vote to kill the ssc i 
the case that every phd in high energy physics went into wall street or kind of financial consulting every 
one of them another story that leads to a different kind of bubble that burst as we now again 
in hindsight that leads to helps to fuel the dotcom bubble and collateralized debt obligations and all this fancy 
stuff on wall street dk but in the the first effect is an outwave of people just leaving the 
a secondary effect is that twice as many people leave particle physics as enter it in a narrow window 
the ones who stay in science who stay in physics in particular they go to these kind of neighboring 
hybrid areas and not just by chance a blueribbon panel brought together by the national academy of sciences saying 
happened in this crisis and how do we prepare for the next time in this expert report on what 
to physics it was actually called physics in crisis maybe physics in transition but i think it was crisis 
the community says the particle theorists like you and me particle theorists were hit hardest when the bad times 
we were the most narrowly trained saying this about the early that they had become so hyperattuned to us 
a certain kind of question not being broadly trained in the view at least and why that group suffered 
worse than the other field that also was undergoing a real strain so they say we have to change 
we train high energy theorists most of all they have to be exposed to the broad areas of physics 
kinds of requirements on coursework and general exams this is when you start seeing a new wave of attention 
pedagogical eventually in funding to areas like gravitation and cosmology and astrophysics so not so surprising that by the 
to late after a new wave of students have come in dreaming of particle physics studying particle theory but 
also formally studying general relativity and cosmology and astrophysics new textbooks being written every year to supply the need 
they start asking questions at this interface between high energy theory and cosmology dk a field called particle cosmology 
really kind of amplified not created from scratch but it really gets an institutional foothold as a kind of 
consequence of this really kind of macroscale shift in funding priorities and geopolitics sc a little bit of making 
out of the lemons that we were given right dk right right and from that we get now you 
i can tick off our favorite successes but we get a whole kind of amazing set of ideas about 
our universe came from where it might be going what are the constituents of matter and how we can 
test them a whole set of questions that people even posing before sc right and so just the legitimacy 
asking these questions appears right dk right right sc even if we yet know the final answers to any 
them chuckle dk right you and i know sc no keeping up for a future podcast yeah dk exactly 
stay tuned sc yeah and a lot of what is now that in the present era in the discussion 
whole new thing of asking for money from entities other than the government right dk right sc asking for 
money and if rubbing shoulders with the government and their secrecy and warlike predilections was problematic asking for money 
private individuals is problematic for a whole new sets of reasons dk it certainly is and so a middle 
sc as we know here at mit for example dk as we know at mit with greater seriousness than 
should have known earlier now inescapable certainly right and is leading to i mean overdue a real moment of 
soulsearching and i use that i mean i really think soulsearching here oncampus not going to go away soon 
real serious concern a legitimate concern but a middle path as well where not just individuals who as we 
can be sort of remarkably problematic but sc and also to be fair remarkably generous and helpful dk absolutely 
certainly true sc yeah the spectrum dk the spectrum the full range not the full range the range of 
foibles among very rich individuals so not the full range of humanity because most of us that wealthy but 
range of the kind of human complexities right and in between a kind of buffer zone now which i 
is more substantial in terms of both supporting numbers of researchers and just the flow of dollars which are 
foundations or philanthropies and again a kind of irony or surprise here so a growing proportion of research in 
own field and many neighboring fields is supported by private dollars and that often means now foundation money in 
to federal sources national science foundation or other agencies the irony is in some sense a return to what 
been a model in the united states in the and sc or in italy in the century chuckle sc 
indeed why all galileos now all seeking our de medici but unlike seeking an individual you know cosimo de 
ii who might have been quirky now seeking in some sense the foundation based on de tax haven for 
family or whatever it might be seeing it from a slightly more institutionalized slightly more stable structure of private 
than the foibles of an individual and again something looked at historically in the there was again a turn 
private donors in the face of this interruption of federal cash and there it was often in the instances 
looked at it was often quirky individuals who were often extremely generous and wellintentioned by many measures but it 
also not sturdy their personal situations could change sc exactly yeah dk their money they could die and their 
could disagree on how to spend it more if it sort of an endowed gift if it was a 
gift but not permanent and the amount of money was often just frankly not nearly the same the actual 
flow was not the same and so we have that now of course sometimes with just horrible effects not 
sometimes with wonderful effects but a slightly more institutionalized range of the foundation which has often uses something like 
review often has a kind of buffer between the wishes or aspirations of the donor and the researchers so 
that people who get money from the ford foundation have to improve pintos right a way of working out 
like an intellectual autonomy or at least something approaching that which is much harder to work out with an 
writing you a check and it can be more money and it can be a little more stable sc 
have very mixed feelings about the whole thing someone like jim simons the founder of renaissance technologies one of 
most successful electronic trading firms has done an enormous amount for science and enormous credit to him not only 
scientists but also publications like quanta dk right sc the magazine which is probably the best science magazine dk 
yeah sc existing right now but individuals and their primary allegiance is not to the greater good they have 
quirky individual things the templeton foundation john templeton was sort of the british warren buffet but he also really 
to reconcile science and religion and that rubbed some people the wrong way and so choices that people make 
the soulsearching is going to have to keep going on for a long time when big institutions like our 
decide when is it worth the money where should we hand things over and not just science right the 
brothers give money to economics and law schools etcetera dk yeah absolutely no right and so in some sense 
we have our generation has to face this not actually a brand new challenge it is a kind of 
some ways return to what would have been taken for granted less than one hundred years ago just in 
united states let alone in other times and places mit itself has gone through these waves just looking just 
of parochially in my own backyard now basically one hundred years past what was called the technology plan here 
mit the tech plan which was first introduced in mit had a president richard maclaurin he was a cambridgetrained 
physicist although he had no practical knowledge but anyway he was the university president for us here at mit 
coming out of the first world war finances were a mess and he said we need right research and 
is expensive so he says will actively cultivate relationships with local industries a school of technology after and there 
lots of boston area manufacturing firms dk and so the idea that kinda makes sense sure publicprivate partnerships or 
education with local industries sure but a generation in fifteen years later many many faculty on campus including many 
who had been very involved with that project had a kind of reassessment or maybe more ten to twelve 
later and they said gone too that the faculty it was later determined had given away too much kind 
direction of research too many restrictions on who could publish what who was calling the shots of what would 
studied and who could know and there was we have to change or we have to insert more buffers 
a kind of space for academic exploration not so closely tied to the whims of generous nearby partners like 
this case private industry so roughly one hundred years ago roughly fifty years ago we had another moment of 
reckoning here at mit sc amazing just for to say that one hundred years ago it could have been 
dk it could some of it feels very very current right so roughly fifty years ago in at mit 
indeed in many other campuses across the us we had a different sort of reckoning faculty and students and 
and community members more broadly the role why is the pentagon paying for such a high proportion of the 
on campus with again what seemed like inappropriate conditions or restrictions and i mean like marches in the street 
are photographs in the archives of local cambridge police with their billy clubs and their riot gear clubbing protesters 
some protesters taking swings it was really it was a real fight marching down to demand the divestiture of 
from certain kind of defenseoriented laboratories and demand other kinds of changes in academic governance and who gets to 
going to do what project and who can share it so we have these moments one hundred years roughly 
hundred years ago it looked like private money is the way to go including in particular kind of industrial 
dk fifty years ago up until fifty years ago it was simply beyond a question of course federal money 
the clean money so it seemed chuckle until that seemed really really not so clean in the midst of 
vietnam war and these other very serious concerns and so we have these kind of pendulum swings between whose 
is it seems sort of obviously the way to go what kind of money and we found we threaded 
needle yet not successfully sc and one of the extra issues with private money is sometimes that the rich 
richer kind of a fact like they want to give money to the sexiest most glamorous subfields or whatever 
researchers or universities dk yeah a version of that too where even if we think about very very wealthy 
it comes up now in sort of crowd funding for science too i get asked about this a fair 
by journalists who are writing about kinda kickstarterlike campaigns for or patreontype campaigns for science on one hand like 
a lovely idea i mean it appeals to me it it means that some large number of ordinary people 
excited about science so excited actually put some of their own cash behind it that who could not love 
sc by the way we have very generous patreon supporters for the mindscape podcast i love them from the 
of my heart chuckle dk a giver through patreon sc me too yeah dk individual artists and creators no 
to knock that platform but as applied to universitybased scientific sc hard to see how it could possibly fill 
role in any substantial way dk well on the one hand the value i think not going to build 
ssc with that for better or worse or other large things but also how much of going to be 
by the quirks of social media fandom the best slickest youtube promotional video might attract more clicks more likes 
have peer review with all the frustrations and flaws of peer review at least a process at least something 
a procedure to try to rationally allocate funds not perfect but at least a structure crowd funding is like 
looks cool and so i have other concerns about other ways to engage say private sources of funding even 
again what i would think would be wonderful intentions not going to get us not going to bring us 
the promised land either sc yeah no well okay good so just to wind up then what will bring 
to the promised land chuckle or at least how should we be thinking for sort of mediumterm thinkers here 
maybe just a mushy milque toast answer but i think we have to have some combination like how could 
not and i think that not only for say political reasons kind of drawing from many kinds of sources 
therefore many kinds of motivations but i think physics has suffered more than once in recent years and sort 
in living memory from being hooked on a kind of monoculture on a single kind of source that source 
to infinity it might last over decades sometimes last much shorter but it certainly a single element in the 
is not the way to go so with something like with our eyes open to buffers peer review academic 
freedom to publish with those kinds of controls or conditions really laid out in advance then i think we 
hopefully move nudge toward a model that has federal inputs maybe state and local governmental inputs some kinds of 
support some kind of private industrial support maybe some carefully vetted individual generous donors as well and maybe the 
to fill out a sustainable program and we might not get to build the next ssc that way but 
hopefully could train a lot of really really smart students in the meantime sc well and the other thing 
think you are going to agree with me on this one so all preaching to the converted here but 
the rest of science the rest of academia could do a little better job of making their case broadly 
the importance of what they do dk i think exactly right and the importance can include things like really 
contributions to the economy think about the electronics the consumer electronics market where would that be without basic research 
a host of fields physics chemistry many fields of engineering sort of curiositydriven research that has led to what 
now take for granted every day so clearly some of it will be spinoffs applications a kind of better 
through chemistry if that phrase so difficult to say with a straight face but it also should be something 
what makes us curious people part of our human quest to know who we are where we are and 
and i think that be tied to a shortterm goal and there has to be space there has be 
balance and some space to say we need really openended curiosity we need to be able to support that 
if it make us better widgets in the next quarter sc singing my song the perfect place to end 
to you david kaiser thanks so much for being on the podcast dk sean it was a real pleasure 
music as a graduate student in physics in the late i can attest to the accuracy of professor account 
the adverse job market for physicists around one thousand nine hundred seventy as a result of changes in federal 
funding as he says there were many federal economic and community incentives in the especially after the sputnik launch 
scientifically minded students to pursue majors in physics advanced physics and chemistry courses were offered in larger high schools 
with scholarships science fair awards and generous grants as an aspiring physicist i took advantage of as many as 
could however as i completed course work for an advanced degree in one thousand nine hundred seventy there were 
reports of phd physicists and mathematicians either unemployed or taking menial jobs for salary reluctantly instead of writing a 
for my advanced degree i enrolled in law school and ultimately became a bank lawyer i never lost my 
in science though and always thought my experience in the physical sciences was an asset in analyzing legal issues 
podcast brought back memories answered many questions and is greatly appreciated pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast david kaiser on 
money and power three quarks daily hi dr carroll been a long time fan of the podcast and really 
this episode i usually listen while at work and sometimes i hear one of the advertisements and am interested
