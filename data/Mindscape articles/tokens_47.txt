sean caroll and people who like science very natural often also enjoy science fiction we like to think that 
fiction is the literature of ideas right that science fiction takes us places puts human beings in situations where 
fiction which is constrained by reality might not let us go so opportunities within science fiction to ask questions 
to examine existing questions in ways that would otherwise not be possible sc so today we have an interesting 
in the science fiction universe talking to seth macfarlane the actor director writer famous for of course things like 
guy the animated show movies like ted and once upon a time in the west and seth also has 
a singer and arranger of music but the project that working on that most interested for this conversation is 
orville this is a as you might know science fiction tv show that appears on fox had just completed 
second season the third season will be upcoming and basically star trek with some comedic touches i think in 
early days people were a little confused about what the orville was supposed to be it had dramatic elements 
comedic elements and it took about half a season i would say in season one to find its feet 
but now to be honest not just because seth is on the show i think this is one of 
most interesting tv shows out there sc they are really using the medium of science fiction to talk about 
that are very very relevant to us here on earth right now so what seth agreed to talk about 
we had a very interesting thoughtful discussion about how you come up with these scenarios how they do relate 
going here on earth how the real world cannot help but affect your science fictional drama that writing and 
backwards how thinking about these new things in the sciencefictional setting can give us new handles on the problems 
have here on earth so i think a very rewarding conversation also the first thing that comes up and 
admits true is that seth has a really wonderful voice for radio or podcasts so always makes it a 
experience i think gonna like this one go music sc seth macfarlane welcome to mindscape podcast seth macfarlane thank 
very much sc so you seem to be able to keep busy seem to have a lot going on 
know you have had tv shows and movies various forms of talking animals and talking stuffed animals but i 
wanted to concentrate on the orville this science fiction show which become a big fan of why we say 
the show is for the few of us in the audience who know sm the show is kind of 
classic style episodic scifi adventure series that sort of adheres to the traditional scifi method of storytelling which is 
take elements of our society whether it be social or political or scientific and find ways to tell stories 
those things in an allegorical fashion through the lens of scifi and for me i grew up with episodic 
i grew up with things like the twilight zone and obviously star trek and i miss that style of 
which i could see a selfcontained show that was based around an idea as opposed to a twist and 
think in the age sc oh a good way of putting it can you give an example sm well 
the age of streaming shows where dealing with a story arc that lasts throughout the season kind of hard 
explore a lot of different areas hard to the diversity of stories becomes less in that format and it 
to become about how can i surprise the audience with a crazy twist rather than what used to be 
case is what new idea can i present to the audience this week and you really can only do 
with selfcontained stories i think sc yeah and certainly a big fan of a lot of the cable prestige 
long series but absolutely a place sm but all getting now sc i know exactly sm the problem sc 
miss procedurals and monsters of the week and whatever sm yeah yeah i mean nice one of the mission 
of the orville is that within reason we do like to reward our fans for sticking with us but 
also should be something where you have to commit to an entire season right off the bat if you 
to you can watch one hour and tell you a story that require you to have followed every soapopera 
come before it and no television show you can watch now where the first episode insist that you stick 
for the next eight or like the things paying sc no one has that kind of time yeah does 
create pressure on you or the writers to come up with a new plot every week sm yeah a 
kind obviously to map out a serialized arc throughout the course of a season is a lot of work 
i do think that at the end of the day one idea one story that telling over the course 
eight or ten episodes to come up with a brand new idea every i have such renewed respect for 
like serling particularly at a time when there was nothing to there was no template to work from he 
to reinvent the wheel that he was able to bring a brand new idea every week and not just 
for sc and the twilight zone was obviously one of the inspirations even more obviously star trek was an 
so just tell the audience you have a spaceship on the bridge aliens sm yeah interesting that the idea 
what is in effect a naval ship in space rather than on the waters is something been around since 
since before the but obviously in film that seems to be where it emerged in the most memorable way 
the serialized films that come from that era star trek was the first franchise to really solidify it as 
of work out the kinks and interesting if you watch star wars or buck rogers and these subsequent shows 
all kinda taking cues from the original star trek star wars uses the term cloaking device something that they 
from star trek sc tractor beams sm yeah yeah yeah tractor beams sc photon torpedoes sm absolutely yeah they 
a whole toolbox there sm they wrote the book for all of us and really just how you wanna 
it and i think for us if the star trek franchise was doing that particular thing at this point 
time then there might not be a place for the orville but because not gone more of the streaming 
direction left this big wide opening that been able to step into with our show and been having a 
sc so i take it you were a star trek fan growing up were you science fiction fan in 
sm i was yeah i was kind of picky and choosy about the scifi that i never really got 
blade runner battlestar galactica or this kind of hard scifi and really i was a big fan of star 
big fan of the twilight zone i enjoyed some ray bradbury some of it got a little too heady 
me when i was a kid laughter sc so it was reading as well as tv movies sm yeah 
i used sc i was a heinlein guy myself at that age but also as marvel and sturgeon and 
yeah interesting i bought a collection of his short stories and really out there interesting a lot of comedy 
his writing a lot of mixing scifi and comedy and some of them are very much of their time 
others have these little snippets of wisdom that are applicable to ours sc how long have you been thinking 
doing a scifi show sm for some time this show originally the orville was gonna written as sort of 
feature idea and then very quickly decided nothing like this on tv right the initial version of it was 
comedyheavy and when i look back at it i realize that that really the show that i wanted to 
since kind of taken that pressure off ourselves and veered more towards veered more towards traditional science fiction without 
pressure of having to have that comedy frosting on it to such a degree been having a lot more 
realized this even more so than writing family guy it just comes flowing out easier so maybe i never 
have been a comedy guy in the first place sc laughter we discover ourselves sm yeah chuckle sc not 
yet sm yeah but a blast and gratifying to see that people fans were willing and ready in many 
eager to see that from us i think a lot of it initially was fear that no one would 
me seriously if i wrote a scifi show and been pleasantly disproven sc well i thought it was very 
the initial reaction to the show not just what it was but from whom if getting it correctly like 
you go on to the professional critics season one reviews they were not good sm yeah sc but the 
loved it sm yeah sc and season two caught up right and part of that was it the evolution 
the show or do we educate that sm i think some of it was the evolution of the show 
think the smaller portion was the evolution of the show i think the show changed that much because we 
of the episodes we did show the critics initially was about a girl episode about baby sc a big 
yeah sm and that gets for season one that gets pretty dark sc intense yeah sm i think what 
was it took them a minute to realize that we trying to do the serialized format that everyone else 
doing and that the whole point was to let the story dictate the tone and i remember on the 
star trek you see a lot of that there are episodes that are very dark very dramatic there are 
that feel more like a comedy sc and trouble with tribbles right sm yeah yeah and i see it 
life is that way you have one day where your birthday and you fall in the swimming pool by 
and another day where you lose a family member those days have very different tones and all the same 
but it feels very different and television can reflect that and the characters have to be consistent and they 
to be your anchor but beyond that i think no reason that the story dictate what the tone is 
telling an episodic story that selfcontained and i think what threw the critics i think with three episodes that 
felt like this thing was disjointed look for whatever reason they always come out swinging when i do something 
anyway laughter sm yeah yeah sm a little bit of that like a little bit of the reviews being 
before the thing came out but i you try to ignore it but at the same time gratifying when 
see that nice big fat round tomato and that sc right that does feel good sm i hate it 
sc you do read the comments in other words right i have my little podcast and i try not 
but a social thing that doing sm yeah for television for a podcast as well i imagine doing something 
an audience so there is a partnership between you and the audience sc yeah you care sm sc and 
of it by the way is great sm and a lot of what you do thought is sciencebased right 
on the podcast not quite less than sm yeah yeah where it gets dicey is this idea that we 
all just have different well you can on this but not really on that with entertainment with something like 
orville i read as much as i can i read sometimes torture but read reddit read youtube comments read 
read instagram just get as much information as i can just fun to see people talking about it and 
fans are so passionate about what they like and what they like and you try to balance it between 
own vision of where you want the show to go and what it is they wanna see and i 
if you can thread that needle doing something right i think you let them guide you completely but at 
time you ignore them sc no but you can learn something like not idiots all of them right sm 
no no interesting the isaac twoparter that we did our second season was something that was a big question 
for us it was dark and it was big and it was pure scifi and i had no idea 
people were gonna respond to that or not and not only they responded to it it was the most 
set of episodes to date for the series and the rest of that season kind of put the story 
hold because we had written them all in advance and i realize it was gonna be that successful but 
as much of what i did online i discovered people wanna know what the aftermath of this and so 
it came back sm i hear and dealing with that in season three sc and probably when the show 
came out there were expectations a comedy writer sm yeah sc i think some of the marketing made it 
more like galaxy sm very much yeah sc or a parody show right and then people were a do 
know what to think sm a lot of fear it was a lot of fear on both sides and 
think the second season marketing piece that fox did was terrific i really thought they did a great job 
first season from their end and from my end there was some fear and look i credit jon favreau 
being my conscience when he directed the pilot and he pointed out to me on a number of occasions 
this joke here and i feel like disrupting what is a really good he said should trust that what 
have here into it i read the script and i put it down i wanna know what happened i 
in it i like the story the story works and you need the crutch of all these and that 
i respect him enormously and so to hear that was kind of the first step toward me making the 
that maybe i can do this show that i really wanna do and i have to pack it with 
in the face and people will still sc and yeah i think it seems to evolve to a place 
different than a typical scifi serialized or even episodic show because of the jokes but still story and character 
settingbased sm yeah and the jokes tell you where they wanna appear the twoparter with isaac was there was 
couple of jokes in there but about it and it was where they show up these days is just 
more from the casualization of life on board a spaceship rather than hard jokes just the behavior of the 
sc a little more realistic in some sense right sm yeah yeah and sc people are not quite a 
as you might see in the tv shows sm yeah well yeah and it has to be a tricky 
to walk because you want people to care about what happens you wanna be able to tell a story 
big stakes like we did in identity and oftentimes that means giving up the shtick if this is serious 
characters have to treat it seriously and you just gotta embrace that and so it was nice that the 
went along with us there sc and also another slightly different thing that we have in star trek is 
exwife is your second in command sm yeah sc and a lot more of the personal lives of the 
a lot more socializing sm yeah well the part of sciencefiction that i see enough of i no secret 
i loved the next generation for their among other things for their production design it always made sense to 
that if you were in space for that amount of time you would have to live somewhere that was 
sc they had a bar that was a huge upgrade over the original star trek sm yeah it was 
the scifi version of the apartment on friends sc yeah sm you wanted to be there every week you 
to go back and something that is absolutely absent from sciencefiction today all across the board everything is grim 
dark and looks like on a submarine and cool to look at but it just not a place that 
wanna live in sc yeah it seems a little bit less human i know what you mean sm yeah 
sc and again a place for it but also a place for this slightly sm yeah i i think 
should be able on a good scifi so you should be able to accommodate all of that your characters 
be strong enough that even if no scifi plot you should be able to tell a dramatic story that 
that just deals with their lives sc so when you started planning out the show presumably you had the 
there would be a starship there would be crew some of them would be aliens like how was it 
or kind of torture to sit down and go what are the alien races how are they sm a 
bit because so much sciencefiction now hard to sc lowhanging fruit has been picked sm yeah yeah hard to 
things that been dealt with as you go and as you start to break your stories for the series 
about it is those races kind of pop up in the midst look for both the simpsons and family 
it happened with our characters i remember god was it greg daniels who used to run king of the 
used to i think wrote on the simpsons like where did all these characters come from this populace of 
in and he said just kinda popped up as we went a character would emerge in the middle of 
story sc like good we need to develop sm yeah be a funny character so make that person a 
of the town and eventually the same thing happened with family guy these characters popped up as we were 
these stories and with the orville been the same we will tell a story and an alien race will 
as part of the narrative and it works and so we keep them around sc so there it seems 
explicit at least to me that you are taking advantage of the idea that science fiction can comment on 
current state our current problems in various ways you wanna mention some of your favorite i have a long 
here of different things done sm yeah a broad question in other series or what as far what done 
no on the orville what thinking of is the obvious example is bortus when he basically develops a porn 
right chuckle sm yeah yeah sc on what is equivalent of a holiday sm yeah yeah yeah yeah sc 
that was not an alien worry a very human worry sm no yeah i think that episode was the 
time we ever got a standards note in the history of the show by the way sc pretty good 
for me to have that experience like right a broadcast standards we never hear from them ironic that i 
one show been virtually condemned by the parents television council and another been roundly endorsed not sure how many 
can say that in their career but yeah that was an episode that yeah just dealt with the psychology 
look in the age of the internet when walking around with a little device in your pocket that can 
naked pictures twentyfour hours a day and gonna affect relationships gonna really fuck with heads and there has to 
some kind of fallout for that and that may be a little i probably sound like a conservative with 
be sc well that was pretty mellow yeah yeah sm yeah there has to sc there are issues sm 
sc it mean ban it right it mean let it happen but we should face up to the changing 
and so how we interact with things sm you just have to be aware of of what your relationship 
with technology and twitter is the best example all on twitter and i fucking hate it i know about 
sc i kinda love it i really do sm you do sc i do yeah i block people a 
and what makes it tolerable sm yeah but that a tricky thing because i used to do that i 
do it from time to time just i wanna deal with it but almost like people take it as 
tacit sc a victory yeah no sm yeah they wear it as a badge of honor and like you 
wanna give them sc let them have their victory i thought that for a long time i muted people 
i like and what convinced me was friends who said if you mute somebody then the rest of the 
reading the comments on your tweet still hear them only you miss them whereas if you block them then 
just interact sm right sc a weird thing because broadcasting to everybody right sm do you think any positive 
this point and i think initially obviously twitter was this charming little platform that was new and fun and 
would each write a joke every sc yeah and it was funny yeah chuckle sm do you think any 
to twitter at this point in time sc i invited you at this podcast over twitter chuckle sm okay 
beyond that laughter sc no made good friends over twitter i met people who i otherwise have met people 
friends in real life i learn about things i can follow people i was just joking with we were 
with a friend of mine last night about this i tried really hard to follow a bunch of conservatives 
twitter and i found that the only ones who i could really follow without degrading my state of mind 
ones who hated donald trump sm yeah yeah yeah sc so there are those principled conservatives but then a 
swamp out there crazy people who i try hard to avoid sm yeah yeah yeah it is tricky i 
a lot of liberal friends obviously i live in hollywood i do have a fair number of conservative friends 
yeah there is a difference between your conservative friend who votes for mitt romney and your conservative friend who 
for donald trump those are two different types of people maybe more crossover than like to think and i 
to not let that keep me up at night sc well i think twitter twitter and facebook and all 
things just in the beginning right a technology changing everything i do believe that gonna have implants in our 
before too long that will let us do this without the intermediary of the phone and lots of science 
stories being written about this sm and interesting there is a actually somebody who does not subscribe to the 
i think as much as i grouse about twitter and the early forms of this technology i do think 
lot of at the moment destructive power that they seem to have much more so than constructive you look 
talk about implants in your head look at something like evolution which is real just establish that sc yeah 
official mindscape position that evolution is real sm but just this staggering brainless moronic thing that makes its way 
the millennia having and stumbles on us by accident sc yeah sm like at a certain point you do 
of think to yourself we could do a better chuckle sc yeah sm and a sc and sm a 
onus that goes along with that sc those among us are trying yes sm and i and i think 
time to kind of maybe revisit that idea because if you god if you could just tweak some things 
the human body god look at eating sc yeah sm your sc disgusting right sm evolution still thinks that 
there with a spear in my hand trying to hunt a boar sc yeah sm it realize that like 
right sc well i think that the thing because we focus a lot on ai and computers but i 
that the making human beings more automated and changing them editing talked on the podcast with synthetic biologists who 
building cells from scratch sm yeah sc and yeah why i say just at the beginning of what these 
are gonna take us to sm and i think that really but how different is that from using a 
to save your life if you have an infection sc in some sense not right but so the thought 
is what if i invent a drug that just makes you happy all the time but you never leave 
chair is that an improvement in your life or sm i think called jack daniels laughter sc you have 
leave sometimes sm yeah no and yeah a concern sc yeah brave new world gonna be seeing sm yeah 
and a huge believer that science fiction helps us just go a little bit toward thinking these things through 
of time sm yeah well a big job then sc so bortus for those who have not seen the 
bortus and klyden are members of this race the moclan and told there are only men only male moclans 
they manage to give birth somehow which makes me think that there are really only female moclans but so 
quite sure what the definition of male or female is sm i think struggled with that a little bit 
storytelling value that that species gives you as opposed to the logic of the biology what kinda landed on 
their definitions are a little different than what ours sc very masculine presenting right sm yeah yap sc pretty 
sm because it at the end of the day you can always fall back on aliens sc right sm 
yeah an it was a dynamic that i seen before these two very stoic kind of classically science fiction 
who who were a pair who are mates sc yeah sm and have this kind of domestic life going 
and those two actors are just gold sc fantastic chad sm chad coleman who i think also does the 
sc oh yeah he was cutty on the wire sm and peter macon obviously as bortus my favorite couple 
tv chuckle sc i can endorse that you could do a lot worse but so gonna mention in the 
that spoiling everything so okay but they have a child sm yeah sc it is female this is a 
and the cultural expectation is that there will be a sex change to turn it into a boy sm 
sc and that is heavy stuff to be tackling right there in season one sm yeah well what always 
me and again the specifics of that episode and that conflict are arguably less pertinent than the more general 
at play in there and if you have another culture that does things their own way that stack up 
your morals and your code of ethics but still their culture at what point do at what point do 
respect their ways and at what point does that get so insane that you justify it in your own 
or live with yourself and it becomes time to be galaxy police sc and claire i guess is the 
sm yeah sc and she so her question she is also one of the treasures of the show by 
way that actress is amazing sm oh she is great she is great yeah sc she wanted to know 
she worked through the ethical dilemma here sm yeah sc who is benefiting from this is it medically necessary 
is this just a cultural thing and i think obvious answers to these questions sm those are my favorite 
of stories and look as much as i as much as i think there is an absence in television 
noble people who just wanna do the right thing an antihero and i do miss the simplicity of gary 
saying it i just got married but i gotta turn around and go fight this bad i do think 
not a good thing that that exist on television that when i was a kid i it was fiction 
there were people like pickard and it sc yeah sm people who people who were just out to even 
super heroes the super friends for sakes they were so wholesome but these were people who were just out 
do the right thing and i think at the end of the day to see people struggling with what 
right thing is but yet coming from a noble place and coming from a virtuous place but not being 
to find a clear answer those to me are the most interesting kind of stories that i can latch 
to i get a little weary of this guy is a murderer and a drug addict and all this 
supposed to sympathize with at a certain point just watching terrible people do terrible things sc it does wear 
down a little bit sm i love the tale but at a certain point i start to get tired 
girl getting kicked around just sc i read the book i bring myself to watch have you seen fleabag 
i seen fleabag sc really really good but in the beginning just hard because just so many bad things 
sm yeah yeah yeah sc dead people sm but it the most fun stuff to write is those stories 
have a clear cut and what always looking for on the orville the stories have a clear cut right 
wrong and things that where you have to weigh the rights of the individual against the needs of the 
all interesting stuff and all stuff that science fiction is arguably more equipped than any genre to address and 
have a blast writing those kinds of stories sc we had a thought while watching some superhero movie every 
movie is a trolley problem basically like the choice between being nice to my friend who i know or 
the universe sm yeah sc and of course because a super hero movie they usually figure out how to 
both sm yeah sc but these are the real dilemmas and they play out in infinite number of different 
sm yeah fun to leave that look there are certain stories where it is clear this is right and 
is wrong you may disagree with me but pretty confident in my ethics i find a lot of what 
do on the orville is we struggle along with the characters a tough thing that story is a good 
this is their society but what doing is really fucked up and look saudi arabia is a perfect example 
culture but look how they treat women at a certain point sc yeah not sm at a certain point 
do you walk in there and say gonna stop doing this and gonna start doing things this people have 
opinions i happen to believe that in that scenario there is an argument to be made for being a 
bit of a hero and helping out the oppressed but not everyone agrees with that some people would say 
culture not your business sc yeah on your side in the sense i do think sometimes gonna try to 
but i certainly historically recognize that plenty of times when societies have talked themselves into the idea that they 
the virtuous ones and in fact they were just imposing their own views right chuckle sm yeah yeah sc 
crusades and colonies and the whole bit sm yeah sc did you get pushback from that episode by people 
have interests one way or the other in gender reassignment or gender identity sm we no certainly not from 
company interesting about fox is for all of their conservatism on the news side never once been censored in 
way with anything that done i will say that for them and when the episode aired there there were 
reactions and there was a lot of passionate things written about the story and again there was some things 
i read that educated me a little bit and some things that i thought w were a little maybe 
so correct in their analysis of the show but overall the reaction that i found to that show and 
was gratifying was that at least talking about this on a sc yeah yeah and reach a different set 
audiences than the one that are very passionate on twitter about these things right well sexuality is definitely going 
be an area where science fiction can talk about things that are a little out there and done it 
had your human characters have sex with androids or with robots with gelatinous blobs and some of that was 
brave like the scene where claire was having sex with a gelatinous blob sm yeah chuckle sc never gonna 
my brain sm yeah that yeah again god bless penny man game for whatever you throw at her sc 
i think that it makes the audience think about if i do find this icky why do i find 
icky is that something intentionally going for sm yeah no right way to answer that i find the icky 
i wanna have sex with a gelatinous probably not and okay chuckle sc a gelatinous blob played by norm 
chuckle sm yeah yeah yeah but yeah it leaves the door open for interpretation in a lot of cases 
but in contrast when she fell in love with isaac the robot it was not played for laughs in 
way right it was actually very tender sm yeah well the idea of the artificial intelligence trying to understand 
trying to communicate sc a classic sm a classic because both warm and fuzzy and funny a lot of 
colors that you can play with with a character like that like the nonhuman characters trying to grasp human 
is always a and always a rich source of scifi writing but yeah to me i know i thought 
not at a certain point reasonable to assume that an artificial intelligence is gonna reach the point where it 
consciousness i would think maybe happened already i know but presumably at some point not a crazy thing to 
will happen and so is that off limits a person sc well getting there the sex robots are definitely 
and then the sex robots will be easier than love interest robots sm yeah chuckle sc but gonna happen 
sm and then of course the question of rights like you really have a sex robot sentient chuckle sc 
yeah yeah sm that would not be moral sc yeah sm but yeah that story was interesting because i 
that i just wanted to tell sort of a classic hollywood love story that ended with singing in the 
laughter and these two very very different people the version of emotion from somebody who feel sc right sm 
the best example of that that i can think of was alan jay solution to when he was writing 
lyrics for fair is that song grown accustomed to her chuckle like that was his solution to a love 
not a love song because henry higgins was not this was not an emotional character i mean not in 
way it was you know a lot of histrionics but he he was very cold and unfeeling and so 
made no sense for this guy to sing a love song so what he latched on to was that 
had just become used to her presence and that i took a little bit of that and applied it 
isaac in trying to determine what it is about him that would fit with his machine mentality but would 
acknowledge her absence from his life sc we really help but tell these stories from a humancentric point of 
sm yeah very hard your audience is human sc yeah they are mostly human laughter and sm mostly human 
sc mostly human and therefore there will always be this hint or this implication that the emotionless robot can 
something from us sm yeah sc and maybe there been enough of us learning something from them sm i 
agree funny when i used to watch the original star trek i used to have that thought about spock 
was always this nagging thing in my head that would scream guy kinda has it figured laughter like it 
sc once every several years he goes crazy but okay sm seems like this society is a lot more 
laughter than what we have going on sc we developed science and everything yeah sm but no i think 
true i think look in a perfect world where the terminator come true you do reach a point where 
the distant or not so distant future if artificial intelligence is an element a daytoday part of our lives 
we do learn from each other sc so you also talk about religion on the show you have the 
who are highly religious basically religious fanatics right do but it seem like it was an element of the 
but it like an indepth investigation of the pros and cons sm yeah yeah and in the third season 
broadening that culture a little bit so not just that one note i wanna give anything away sc sure 
but an element i know whenever i write the krill i have always a different idea of who they 
in my head are the are they terrorists are they us are laughter sc are we the real terrorists 
i can never really figure out where it is they land and always sort of a metaphor for something 
well other than robots it seems implausible that an entire race of creatures would be evil sm yes i 
completely yeah sc so gonna have good aspects and bad aspects sm and where teleya teleya is one of 
favorite characters michaela mcmanus came in to do a guest spot on this one episode and she was so 
that we just ended up deciding this is gonna be a character gonna see over and over but sc 
was the moclan am i remembering correctly sm she was the krill the krill woman who gordon sc oh 
teacher sm yeah sc yeah sm and in the second season we brought her back and again another one 
my favorite goto scifi stories is the enemy mind idea where you look for that commonality in the enemy 
always there always there sc yeah sm almost always right probably hitler have it laughter but for the most 
hitler had a mother laughter sm yeah there is a commonality the extreme version i do think that when 
sit down with conservatives even hardcore conservatives you do find that you have a lot more in common than 
thought going into it wanting to be the bad guy everyone wants to believe that doing the right thing 
that idea of no matter as you said like no matter how bad the race is kind of irresistible 
eventually you meet one that that turns out to be somebody that you can relate to sc surprise you 
some way sm yeah sc well and going back to twitter one of the things about our current moment 
we can demonize whole groups of other people because we hear about them all the time without interacting with 
right sm yeah exactly sc somewhere else and so we can hold this cartoon of them in our brain 
yeah yeah and look i think that i think happening look fox news made a whole career of that 
news made a a brand in that rather sc there was this article recently like fox news destroyed my 
you seen that one sm i see that no sc basically i used to go home and my parents 
would have slightly reactionary opinions but we could talk but now they think that all my friends are the 
sm yeah yeah too oversimplified look fox news no getting around it that that network is one of the 
some would say the biggest instigator of that kind of thinking when they all started the network it was 
storytelling it was creating heroes and villains these are the good guys and these are the bad guys people 
see they want that simplistic narrative sc they were talented at telling those stories sm oh yeah oh yeah 
still are as destructive as it is you can see the formula about us and them and i never 
that from the other side until the emergence of social media and my god you make a mild observation 
conservatives liberals all come after you sc so am i mistaken or is i seen any social media on 
orville chuckle sc is that gotten rid of in the future sm oh oh on the show i was 
say marketing people really doing their job then are sc the other way around seen the orville on social 
not social media on the orville sm yeah something that we felt was better addressed as something that is 
the social media episode in season one was i think a much more effective use hard there are certain 
that cultural things are really hard to depict in science fiction without looking silly chuckle sc or looking dated 
years later right sm or looking dated yeah technology is easy the uniforms are easy the ships are easy 
when you get people ask me all the time come they never how come the music that they listen 
come the pop culture is always of our and i always have to say you ever heard future music 
scifi that sound so fucking no way you predict it if i could predict that be a billionaire in 
music industry laughter sc so why not get a joke out of it right why not have billy joel 
there all the time sm just a those are things that are not there to do that job for 
futurists laughter sc so i also like beyond big themes like social media religion or whatever had some interesting 
just about personal anxiety and imposter syndrome roughly speaking john i guess it was we learn at some point 
super smart and genius iq but has been hiding it in a way that many people can probably relate 
and is that again where does that come from is that personal experience on the writers or is there 
mission to sort of tackle questions like that sm that was sort of it was a little simpler than 
look impostor syndrome i think a lot of people in hollywood feel it this idea that a fraud and 
really making anything great sc we have that in academia too laughter sm yeah yeah chuckle i tend to 
back at things that written or even things that in the process of writing and beat myself up and 
convince myself that i should get out of the business and do something completely different laughter sm but that 
more of a result of the need to give that character something more to do you have a helmsman 
a navigator side by side and we had made this whole deal about gordon being the best pilot in 
fleet and john sitting next to him sc nothing compensating sm the two of them are great together but 
that we wanted him to have his own identity there was a little bit of a sacrifice because so 
together that you no longer have them sitting next to each other and you lose a little bit of 
but what we gain was an identity for this character that really ended up a giving us a story 
b being the anchor for this kind of gallery in engineering that laughter sc a wild world down there 
the engine room yeah sm and kinda the steve martin roxanne character gotta kinda corral the fire department laughter 
well that i think very interesting for as an audience member probably we attribute much too much intentionality and 
to everything that happens in the story in the episodes but in fact sometimes like a problem and you 
to fix it and that leads to new story options right sm yeah interesting times when they predict things 
and they figure it out and right that we have thought this out the isaac turning on the crew 
something that was in our minds from day one that was all part of the plan but there are 
things that i will read and react in such a chuckle sm say to myself think that way smarter 
we are this is way sc is there either a danger or an opportunity to get ideas by reading 
tweets sm yeah i think you never wanna be in a position where stealing something from somebody but if 
says something about the show like boy love to see or love all fair game all fair game just 
to your fans and yeah hearing what the audience wants so i do pay attention to that stuff sc 
a science fiction show but also a science fan for its own sake i think that the first time 
saw you in person was at the science and entertainment exchange lunch event sm yeah yup yup sc my 
jennifer was the director of the science and entertainment exchange sm oh fantastic yeah yeah yeah yeah sc she 
the first director yeah and an organization that does a great amount of good here in town definitely sm 
absolutely sc so how much do you care about the science of your science fictional universe sm well look 
have to acknowledge that the whole reason the science and entertainment exchange was created to my knowledge is that 
many people get their science from fiction they get their medical science from er and anatomy sc their law 
law order sm and they their law from csi or whatever law order but so i think there is 
responsibility to be right andre has been doing this for years sc andre bormanis yeah sm andre bormanis has 
doing this for years if something that hazy on pick up the phone and call neil degrasse tyson or 
many cases walk across the hall to annie office who works in cosmos and not technically a scientist but 
god she sure talks like one and you do try to do my god i was in a session 
my psychiatrist and i stopped in the middle to take some notes about a story let me ask you 
if alien did this and he came in here and he sat down on this couch how would you 
and or if at i go for my annual physical and i have a medical question that relates to 
story telling i do try to get it from the right sources you time will only allow so much 
that but you do try to be responsible if something a story just too damn good that requires us 
stretch it a little bit then we will but where feasible we do try to be scientifically responsible yeah 
a big believer that the science serves the story in a fictional environment the science should be of the 
that it makes you not go that sm well it ever feel like magic and one area that brandon 
and i have talked about this this one area that we both struggle with when writing aliens is that 
idea of the super strength from a planet with high gravity that i can get on board with that 
one that i always struggle with is telepaths the one that always i can never wrap my brain around 
that feel like magic how basically writing a psychic if you employ technology into the mix then i start 
kinda see it sc but you even have a teleporter machine a transporter machine sm we sc was that 
conscious decision sm it was a conscious decision for two reasons one that obviously so emblematic of star trek 
two if you study the science of it you know this sc i do but go ahead sm killing 
basically sc not the same person sm if not the same person sc yeah a different copy of you 
committing suicide and being reformed as a copy sc and that bothers you sm it just seems like just 
enough that it need to the shuttles do just fine sc yeah you can shuttle people around actually it 
be a little bit more dramatic thing sm and you get cool shots the orchestra gets a chime obviously 
the they did that because it saved money sc yeah right now you just shuttle sm but now you 
show the ships leaving those shots the shuttle leaving the bay nice and like it makes the world seem 
and this is a big deal when we launch one of these things going down to a planet and 
fun sc i do have to ask though about time travel introduced time travel in last few episodes of 
two as soon as you allow yourself time travel a million choices you need to make storytelling wise sm 
yes sc so were there a lot of arguments discussions in the room about that sm we recognize opening 
can of worms surprising how many fans of scifi do have an aversion to time travel they just really 
you going there sc a dangerous mixture sm a dangerous mixture always to me always fun a big fan 
time travel stories a big fan i loved that that stephen king talked about the jfk assassination sc oh 
never saw it sm i was loved it you need only look as far as back to the future 
recognize the narrative value that time travel serves in fiction you just have to be careful you just have 
be careful a lot to think about and i think we filled all the holes in that story but 
sure sc well did you see avengers endgame sm i sc so a line in there where paul sm 
have to find six hours out of my life sc yeah true where he says time travel in there 
he goes you mean back to the future was just and i think that might be partly my fault 
was an advisor on endgame and i explained in detail why back to the future was bullshit to the 
sm yeah sure a all the paradoxes in back to the future are undeniable but also a conflict sc 
paradoxes i get that what really i cannot stand in back to the future a brilliant movie like a 
fine wonderful but michael j fox does something in the past and then in real time we see photographs 
in the present how does it sm yeah well did you ever see frequency a dennis quaid movie where 
cuts sc no i never did sm he cuts off the hand in the past and then in the 
the guy watches his hand disappear sc oh i see that looper has the same thing sm yeah a 
silly a little silly sc has a very similar thing yeah more than a little silly but i think 
yeah as far as i could tell consistent sm really hard to tell stories though with there was an 
of star trek that did it very well called enterprise that was everything changed instantly and that you were 
in the new timeline and that was it sc sciencewise all actually bullshit though sm is it sc yeah 
yeah sc not what would happen even if time travel were possible not what would happen sm what would 
sc the most sensible way to have time travel is you can travel to the past but you cannot 
it sm oh interesting so sort of what stephen king used in his book but so certain elements of 
universe presumably seeming as if they the laws of physics would forbid it sc right sm in some fashion 
a tree would fall so sc it yeah i think that actually made small efforts to make this happen 
think a wonderful tv show to be made about a time traveling detective sm yeah sc who can go 
and learn things about the past but not change it and sometimes a murder or whatever you would really 
want to change it but literally you know you and therefore if you sm but how would that manifest 
sc well you know ahead of time all you know is that you will fail right so if you 
to change the past a danger that get killed or something like that you know it succeed it happen 
way sm but does that make the universe seem almost like a conscious entity out to stop you sc 
just means that there are laws of physics sm yeah yeah sc that all obeying right and so when 
try to this pitch this people are like not interesting if you change the like well csi is interesting 
shows are interesting they change the past you just learn things about it and if you were there learn 
in a much more dramatic way sm so okay but even just by visiting the past you changing the 
if really sc no because you were always there sm if talking about the butterfly sc you were always 
sm you were always there sc the point and they put it well in lost whatever happened happened right 
yeah yeah sc if you went heinlein tells the story where a character is his own mother and father 
right sm yeah sc but completely consistent sm an interesting story so funny we were playing with something like 
last season and always an interesting story but a hard one to crack sc oh yeah sm the logic 
that is like you gotta work your brain into pretzels chuckle sc but okay sm and i know how 
it is to watch chuckle sc yeah the standard thing to do is have multiple timelines what we talk 
and even maybe in quantum mechanics actually plausible no one really knows but we do it anyway but then 
is i have not a science issue with that but a moral issue with it like when you have 
had at the end of season two a separate timeline and things are bad okay so you send someone 
to fix it now back on the good timeline does that mean you just killed billions of people in 
other timeline sm yeah probably sc you ended their lives sm probably yeah sc the greatest monster chuckle sm 
yep yep that cold calculating the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the sc you made a 
chuckle sc but a whole universe that you got rid of sm yeah yeah a very good point chuckle 
i think where faced with a choice and neither one look those are again those are the best kinds 
stories like the choice were neither one is really ideal but you have to make a decision sc no 
know and so much fun time travel i get it irresistible fun sm yeah you get to put on 
costumes and all chuckle but yeah no that is an an interesting premise that the universe will protect itself 
all costs sc yeah right now in the case when you can change the past and fix the timeline 
this will just be ignored going forward but there be a forever temptation whenever anything goes wrong to go 
the past and fix it sm yep the question for not a scientist i once read somewhere that time 
to the future is possible and time travel to the past is not sc yeah basically true right the 
i joke about is yesterday i traveled into the future and here i am right but you move it 
second per second einstein says you can go faster in the future but you can never come back sm 
right right well then we have to worry about it sc brian greene wrote a booked called icarus at 
edge of time he wrote a book and i was a little surprised that this counted as a book 
spaceship that traveled close to a black hole and icarus the young child was stranded near the black hole 
then rejoined the rest of civilization later but because of time dilation hundreds of years had passed and his 
was dead and everything like a pretty dark that chuckle sm yeah sc what is the lesson for learning 
sm roald dahl territory sc yeah chuckle sm what if a scifi fan is looking to expand their education 
far as legitimate science written a bunch of books sc yeah sm like the first sean sc i have 
book coming out in september called something deeply hidden about the many worlds of quantum mechanics about the which 
actually thing is true not science fiction that when you observe a quantum system the world branches into multiple 
in each of which got a different outcome and sadly you talk to each other right the but i 
easily imagine science fiction scenarios that were just very slight variations on that theme where you could talk to 
other or influence right like make different choices sm talking like sc parallel universes yeah and like i say 
think this is actually real i think that this is science fiction sm yeah and sc we know for 
sm they would have to be infinite obviously right sc at least a very large number not necessarily infinite 
know sm everything is the same except this water bottle is a little further to the sc yeah sm 
that other universe sc so in your body for sm yeah sc a nuclear decay happens times a second 
that means and every one of those sm why been so tired sc i know every one them makes 
new universe right so two to the five thousand universes are created every second just of you decaying so 
infinity but a very large number chuckle of universes yes and an app on your iphone where you can 
the universe intentionally and then do different things depending on what the outcome was sm oh well great sc 
yeah coming out in september and yeah i think the influence that science has on science fiction is a 
bag right it could easily hamstrung hamstring you but it can also inspire you sm the and interesting where 
think hollywood is a little off track right now because i think a heavy heavy focus on fear the 
of science and the fear of science gone wrong and a lot less of the potential i remember kind 
in the it was completely the opposite every scifi television series was about we figured this even a terrible 
like seaquest chuckle sm look at that they figured that out it was about the positivity of it and 
adventure and the striving and now sc we all love the expanse but a little depressing sometimes sm yeah 
black mirror sm you have to have that in storytelling or you you really start it just becomes a 
and kinda how it is right now like everything is a drag sc one of the great classic scifi 
was always competence right sm yeah sc these people were super smart they could solve puzzles sm yeah people 
wanna be like sc yeah and i think that plenty of satisfying stories to be written about people doing 
things for good reasons chuckle sm sure yeah cool chuckle sc alright i hear you have other things going 
briefly mention those right sm sure chuckle sc you have an album coming out is that true sm yes 
yes yeah yeah once in a while out you have to do this my publicist told you laughter sc 
there might be people in the audience who care they might be interested sm yes a handful of orchestral 
that we recorded at abbey road that are out on itunes that that sc abbey road exciting that must 
yeah yeah if you sc well pressure i guess sm if you like orchestral jazz a good place to 
sc okay sm yeah sc very very good and congrats orville season three is gonna happen obviously sm yeah 
yeah sc so what stage of the process are you in now sm in writing mode written broken about 
have our season pretty much mapped out broken about five stories and deep in the writing sc another kind 
thing sm as of now another yeah sc yeah the standard these days sm yeah well sc when i 
a child it was twentysix episodes per year sm yeah i honestly i know how they did that and 
part of it is that the television viewer expects more now they cable and streaming have as rick berman 
to say people relatively like they want it to look like a movie every week and fine but it 
takes time and it means you do as many things move faster just because of technology you still have 
film actors doing things you still need those pieces in the editing and so thirteen is in production i 
say from my standpoint thirteen episodes in is usually when i start to come apart when i start to 
of stare at myself in the mirror and go know i know if i can go a second inevitably 
the end of both our first two seasons that was when i just hit the wall sc and i 
in this very deeply but i have this feeling that for features often this feeling like film a bunch 
stuff and then make the movie by editing them together in the right whereas for for a weekly tv 
you better know what doing ahead of time sm look honestly that happens in both television and movies sometimes 
director understands editing to me the best directors really have a sense they know enough to know that your 
is as much a director as you are if you can shoot with an idea towards how gonna edit 
thing a lot better off because also editors hate it when directors will say the editor figure it out 
give him all the they like at least the ones that worked with they like to have some sort 
a sense that there is a vision that there is a shape to this and not just asking him 
clean up your mess jon cassar who directed god the share of is our comein onset ep director for 
orville and just a sc well yeah sure sm director when it comes to editing he just has has 
in his head and you get into that edit bay and just all there sc but as someone been 
both sides is there more discipline on the tv side just of the scheduling sm not necessarily some really 
directors in television and some really bad directors in television and the same for film and because god when 
directed ted i got onset and i i had no idea written a script i kinda knew what i 
this thing to look like worked years in animation so i had some sense of scene composition and all 
but i was relatively green and it occurred to me that there must be a lot of people like 
who show up on set in the chair and really belong there yet sc yeah sm i had to 
my director of photography so a an and he was is when you have the back of one character 
you see a piece of them and then the other character over sc did you go to film school 
all sm i did but i majored it was a concentration in animation sc okay i see sm but 
then i remember the hollywood terms being bandied about and and i think there look a lot of talent 
a lot of fraudulence out there chuckle sm and you hope that you been lucky enough to work with 
lot of talented directors but there are some where the editor has to clean up the mess sc well 
looking forward to season three very excited when does it premiere do you know sm looking like fall of 
might be a little sooner sc okay sm but yeah i know it seems like a long time sc 
does yes sm but quote me on that not in stone sc no no i understand but sm it 
be sooner but the last thing that i heard because we get it done in time with all the 
the show takes we get it done in time for january and if on a network either january or 
fall sc a crazy town we live in here sm mmhmm sc yeah a lot of fun things going 
alright seth macfarlane thanks so much for being on the podcast sm thanks so much music thanks so much 
mentioning my friend and mentor theodore sturgeon i also appreciate seth incorporating pheromones in an orville episode other than 
episode the empath rob lowe as an archaeologist exuding pheromones was thoughtprovoking thanks for a very interesting podcast about 
value of science fiction toward the end you mention the theory of many worlds i am fascinated by this 
but it is so hard to believe the numbers of other worlds that would flash into existence every second 
these virtual worlds or real worlds with pasts and futures is the world we inhabit the only one with 
past and a future how many universes would be created to accommodate the new earths so many questions perhaps 
will find the answers in your new book first i preordered your new book something deeply hidden on amazon 
two others second i know your book tour will be soon underway and you will be quite busy however 
you could do a podcast sometime with daniel freedman now at stanford who just won a physics breakthrough prize 
ferrara and van niewenhuizen for their work on supergravity in that would be so interesting i am patience of 
but someday james wade have a listen to number fiftyfive about the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is 
me or did the podcast run the end music to play off seth at the end of the podcast
