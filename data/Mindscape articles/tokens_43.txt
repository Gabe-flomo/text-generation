podcast your host sean carroll and if ever spent time in different cities throughout the united states or anywhere 
the world as long as they are very very different kinds of cities you may have noticed that different 
have different attitudes towards things like jaywalking right you need to get across the street are you at the 
do you have the light etcetera in some cities who cares what the stop light is saying who cares 
you are you just cross the street when the road is clear in other cities people will wait there 
very politely not even imagining that the right thing to do to cross before the stop light says so 
why is that how should we understand these differences in behavior my guest today is michele gelfand a cultural 
distinguished university professor at the university of maryland college park and thinking about not just individual people but how 
cultures differ in their attitudes toward cultural norms written a book called rule makers rule breakers how tight and 
cultures wire our world and the claim is that you can classify different cultures into whether they are tight 
is to say everyone observes the norms very very carefully or whether they are loose there are norms but 
we break them a little bit sc and of course many different ways you can classify different cultures but 
idea is that this particular dimension is especially informative that this tightnesslooseness axis spectrum if you like really tells 
a lot about different cultures and how they behave so michele and i talk about why this is true 
there are tight cultures why there are loose cultures what kinds of places have different ones and in the 
world which cultures are tight and are loose and she gives her opinion that in fact the best place 
be is in between both tightness and looseness have their purposes remember that we have a website for the 
preposterousuniversecompodcast a patreon that you can support us where you get monthly ask me anything episodes as well as 
versions of every episode so with that go music sc michele gelfand welcome to the mindscape podcast michele gelfand 
to be here sc so you had this wonderful new book out that i have to say it struck 
though a psychologist it struck me as something a physicist would want to write kind of like a grand 
theory of certain aspects of people and culture so why you just give us the subway pitch for what 
to say in that book mg sure a crosscultural psychologist so interested in understanding how people around the world 
through like you said sort of parsimonious principles and oftentime we think about culture in terms of rather superficial 
like red versus blue or east versus west or rich versus poor and i wanted to know is there 
deeper code driving our behavior that can help us understand not just modern nations and states but also cultures 
existed thousands of years ago and so as a crosscultural psychologist i set out to try to understand these 
codes and what i discovered is that there is a pretty simple principle that explains a lot of variation 
the world and what i call tight versus loose cultures and it all has to do with how strictly 
adhere to social norms some groups are really tight they have very strong norms and little tolerance for deviance 
other groups are much more lax and are much more permissive and i set out over the last twenty 
to understand why did these differences evolve is there any rationale for why groups evolved to be tight and 
and what are the tradeoffs that they confer to human groups what are the positives what are the liabilities 
what are the conflicts that arise when people from tight and loose cultures tend to meet and how can 
be mitigated so the kind of gist and i can get into lots of details about this sc sure 
get into lots of details i such a wonderfully evocative language tight and loose as soon as you say 
not only can people guess what you mean by that but they can probably even do a pretty good 
of guessing which cultures fit which categorization but nevertheless why you tell us what you mean what are the 
of a tight culture versus a loose one mg yeah so when we first set out to study this 
wanted to see can we measure this construct really key to any scientific endeavor and so we studied over 
nations around the world but the idea that we can place cultures on a continuum from tight to loose 
of course recognizing that each culture has tight and loose elements that we still like we can do with 
still kind of understand what the general trends are and and sure enough we found that people around the 
agreed on the strictness or the permissiveness of the norms in their cultures cultures like japan and singapore germany 
austria tended to veer tight and cultures like new zealand and brazil and greece and the netherlands tend to 
loose and we can also see that this construct tight and loose actually can help us understand variation across 
fifty states rather than red versus blue we have a new map of what states are tight and loose 
can also see it can help us understand organizations through the same lens as well as even our own 
and even our own selves in terms of the pension for rules and punishments when we violate them so 
pretty broad construct and we started at the national level but then as i said we kinda zoomed in 
different levels of analysis to see is there any homology that we can see any similarity in terms of 
construct and how it operates at different levels sc and interesting that you mentioned that people recognize it in 
not that in denial about this but they go yeah no a pretty ruleobeying mg well you know really 
one of the reasons why so passionate about studying culture is that really a puzzle because omnipresent around us 
the time following rules all the time from the time we wake up to the time we go to 
but rather invisible we recognize that all around us like the story about two fish who were swimming along 
one fish says to the other how is the and they say a second laughter and so the simple 
here is that often these things that are around us constantly that we have a hard time recognizing and 
is exactly that puzzle we think about culture so if you can ask people about but they tend to 
about it and they certainly judge other cultures for being really different than them without understanding the strengths and 
liabilities that tight and loose gives us as humans sc and how do i mean sure a lot of 
directions or axes on which we can judge different cultures the amount of individuality or just the economic situation 
different countries so how do you disentangle all these various effects really making a nontrivial claim that this tightnesslooseness 
is one of the most important ones in distinguishing between different cultures mg yeah a really good question i 
back up and say actually lots of ways that cultures vary tight and loose is not the only one 
you mentioned how collectivistic or grouporiented we are familyoriented versus individualistic is another key metric on which we can 
countries and groups and in fact i worked a lot on that construct with harry triandis one of the 
of crosscultural psychology other dimensions also of culture in terms of hierarchy or egalitarianism and like you said also 
wealth and differences on other structural variables mg but in what we wanted to do in the science paper 
was looking at this at the national level is to see can we see that related to but distinct 
these constructs and sure enough it is and so for example tightloose has no direct relationship as in linear 
with gdp there are cultures that are very rich and that are tight and very poor that are tight 
vice versa on looseness and same with individual collectivism for many years in my field including me pretty guilty 
this we kind of thought that collectivismindividualism is the only way to really think about cultural differences and because 
were only comparing east and west which happened to be confounded on individualism collectivism and tightness mg so for 
we know that in my data and this is across different levels tightness tends to be positively correlated with 
but lots of context where you can find off diagonals of tight cultures that are very individualistic emphasize privacy 
are places like switzerland austria germany and lots of collectivist grouporiented cultures that are rather loose for example brazil 
one of the cultures that values family quite a bit same with spain but they tend to have looser 
so in fact trying to unconfound these differences because that way we can understand in broader cultural toolkit to 
understand and predict cultural differences much better sc and maybe i guess i have the advantage of having looked 
your book and so forth so for the listeners out there what would they anticipate if they visited a 
or loose culture what are some of the characteristics you would notice right away or is it things that 
notice right away you would have to discover through interactions mg well i think that these are kind of 
you start to discover as studying many many many different countries and see these kinds of regularities that mean 
a onetoone relationship with these but what we found is a very predictable tradeoff between order and openness and 
is to say that tight cultures have a lot of order they have more monitoring they have less crime 
have more uniformity and more synchrony so for example they have according to our own analysis people who wear 
similar clothing who drive more similar cars even in some of our analyses these are kind of strange unobtrusive 
but if you go to a country and you see that the city clocks have pretty much the same 
on them very likely to be in a tighter context and we know this we can sc yeah i 
that example that was great mg yeah you could go to a looser context i was in italy actually 
year with my kids and husband and a lot of the city clocks they say something completely different not 
sure what time it is and so this is another example of synchrony like uniformity and it turns out 
important in tight cultures talk about that a little bit later mg but also tight cultures have order when 
comes to selfcontrol so the social order is mirrored in really selfcontrol and order within the individual we find 
less debt less alcoholism even less obesity in contexts that are tighter because people are following rules a lot 
and used to actually controlling their impulses much more in a wider range of context and all to say 
loose cultures have a disadvantage on order they have more crime they have less synchrony and uniformity and they 
a host of selfregulation failures but loose cultures as i mentioned they corner the market on openness so we 
see from our data that they have more tolerance for people who are different whether people from different races 
creeds mg in my own data i sent research assistants around the world wearing fake warts i bought them 
the internet for them or they were wearing tattoos on their face or they were just wearing their plain 
and i sent them around to their home countries in twenty countries and simply wanted to see how were 
treated in city streets they looked kind of deviant these individuals and sure enough in the looser cultures they 
much more likely to be helped when they asked for directions or asked for help in city stores as 
to tighter cultures where looking different is dangerous it really enters a lot of uncertainty mg also loose cultures 
more creative according to a lot of different studies and they are more open to change and so again 
just speaks to this order versus openness tradeoff and tight cultures suffer on these indicators much more ethnocentric they 
much more cultural inertia and they also have less creativity but again each strengths is the liabilities and so 
people say is it really depends on the criteria that interested in sc yeah i mean putting aside which 
better it does sound like gonna be a connection here between political orientation at least in the standard dictionary 
of liberal and conservative is it fair to associate liberalness with loose cultures and tightness with more conservative ones 
i think that really good question these labels make sense a lot in the us particularly they change meetings 
different countries but really operating at different levels of analysis so you could think about that there might be 
living in tighter states like in kansas or in north carolina which tends to veer tighter or texas and 
conservatives that live in looser states like new york or california but nevertheless they kinda make each other up 
the sense that liberals tend to like to have weaker norms and are support norms that are looser and 
with conservative so they really kind of operate at different levels of analysis one is at the social level 
social norms the other is at the individual level another way to think about it also is that we 
as individuals navigate tight and loose contexts all the time and we call those contexts conservative or liberal for 
in a library what would you say is that tight or loose sc i would say libraries are pretty 
mg yeah chuckle exactly so often wanted to go into libraries and start singing or dancing or when giving 
colloquium i always wanna do this giving a talk at a major university say i came out to your 
and giving a talk and i start singing and dancing and breaking out some bourbon people will think really 
because a really tight situation more restriction of range on permissible and people give feedback if doing weird things 
weaker situations weaker cultures a wider range of behaviors that are tolerated so like in a public park and 
forth or a party these are contexts that are looser that the sociologist goffman identified years ago and so 
are contexts where we again we as humans we we navigate them constantly effortlessly are able to switch between 
and loose contexts like a job interview or a funeral will be veering tight versus other situations with great 
we even recognize it but of course around the world situations vary tremendously the same situation as what we 
in a science paper even a public park in pakistan is much tighter for example it has a more 
range of behavior than in the united states mg and so really fascinating that a universal dimension that we 
with everyday but we they vary a lot across cultures and where we start to realize that we can 
a lot of conflict when we travel abroad and use our own lens to see the world cultures as 
said invisible and even the ancient philosopher herodes said all pretty ethnocentric he noticed this in his travels in 
book histories and so we expect that things will vary that much and when we start seeing these differences 
on tight and loose we could be pretty judgmental so why really helpful to understand the construct and i 
one example that i found really strange when i was traveling to singapore i know if ever been there 
sc only to the airport yeah gorgeous mg but yeah the beautiful right just gorgeous but called the fine 
because you can get punished for so many different things including not flushing the toilet in public settings chewing 
is also illegal bringing large quantities of gum into the country is illegal unless using it for medicinal purposes 
walking in front of your curtains naked is actually something you could be fined for laughter actually i checked 
on the statute to make sure not fake news and you know all these things seem so ridiculous but 
what i discovered in terms of why these differences might make sense is that tight and loose cultures tend 
evolve for good reasons and one of the most important reasons they vary on is how much threat that 
throughout their histories mg and that threat could be either from mother nature think chronic natural disasters like japan 
had or it could be population density how many people per square mile around you which could cause a 
of chaos a rare example of people per square mile compared to new zealand that has thirty people per 
mile and more sheep per capita than people and also invasions is another thing we thought about humanmade threats 
countries over the last one hundred years we measured this that have had to face potential invasions on their 
also tend to veer tight and the logic is pretty simple when you have a lot of collective threat 
need strong rules to coordinate to survive and in contexts where less threat you can afford to have much 
permissiveness because you need to coordinate as much sc right mg and that principle turns out to help explain 
example this gum ban in singapore which from american point of view sounds pretty ridiculous but apparently people were 
a lot of gum in this very tight space where people feel like living in an elevator a lot 
their life this is so crowded and people were basically throwing their gum on the ground and it was 
a total mess in singapore this was in the late and it was causing trains to malfunction the gum 
getting caught in sensors and elevators and lee kuan knew at the time just said guys just gonna have 
ban this tasty in a place where so many mouths per capita and so it makes sense that that 
in certain contexts not all cultural differences of course make sense but a really important principle that relates to 
and looseness that relates to threat that i found across nations across states across social class organizations that helps 
to make sense of these differences with a little bit more empathy sc and maybe also just different situations 
the same culture i can imagine that the threat level is a lot higher if in the military than 
an undergraduate at university chuckle and probably a corresponding tightnesslooseness distinction there too mg yeah exactly funny because when 
like the military or airlines or nuclear power plants or these are places that need rules they need to 
a lot as compared to startups or design and when the whole fiasco came out about united which arguably 
were following rules too much in this context but nevertheless and i wrote about this united is a context 
airlines in general that you want a lot of rules you want people just making all sorts of weird 
you know what saying sc oh yeah mg but nevertheless and talk about this a little later because no 
that cultures can get exceedingly tight or exceedingly loose and that has a lot of problems and then we 
to start negotiating culture which is an exciting idea because we invented norms and we adapted as a species 
terms of the strength of norms in a lot of ways remarkably well to our ecologies but sometimes we 
get out of whack and become too tight or too loose and where we have a lot of problems 
i spend a lot of time in the book toward the end talking about how we can harness the 
of social norms to have a better planet when that kind of miscalibration happens sc yeah before i forget 
is something that zoomed by that i wanna home in on new york is an example of a relatively 
culture as far as states in the united states are concerned right and a place like north carolina is 
so are you gonna tell me maybe this is true that the clocks out in public spaces in new 
city are more likely to agree with each other and with the right universal time than the clocks in 
north carolina mg well no so new york is loose so clocks tends to sc sorry less likely i 
said that wrong yeah mg yeah right although i studied clocks within the context of the us this was 
but be really exciting to do that kind of work sc yeah and making a prediction right so a 
thing mg right right testable and we can also make a prediction by looking at what people wear and 
they drive do they tend to be more similar more synchrony in these contexts are there more security cameras 
there more monitoring per capita that helps to keep people behaving themselves i could tell you that had my 
of one experience in the south as a new yorker from new york originally and in our data analysis 
could see that loose states tend to be much more rude than tight states which are more polite chuckle 
yeah mg tight states tend to be in our data a little more boring and loose states tend to 
more interesting according to the data in terms of recreational options so there is this tradeoff again at the 
level but i remember driving down to south carolina and was with my then boyfriend now husband and someone 
us off maybe accidentally but we basically flipped them off which in new york is almost like a friendly 
chuckle and this actually this was such an insult i mean the south is an honor culture in general 
my colleague dov cohen and would say and honor cultures tend to be pretty tight not all tight cultures 
honor cultures but honor cultures have a lot of regulations around social etiquette and around norms for politeness and 
and so that even tiny little signal of flipping someone off the bird turned into a car chase on 
highway that was really very aggravating and i was terrified to say the least so obviously not gonna recommend 
study that behavior laughter mg but fascinating about new york and i wanna point this out as an exception 
that people might say new york is really highly densely you just said that that would kind of foster 
and factors that of course override this general principle and one of them has to do with diversity so 
you have a lot of diversity like new york has and has for decades and actually tracked the level 
diversity in the us fifty states over the last two hundred years when you have a lot of diversity 
to agree on norms for behavior you have to have more tolerance for multiple ways of doing things and 
when you have a context where a lot of anonymity where people are not really watching what people are 
new york a lot of anonymity a lot of mobility where people coming and going that makes it harder 
have a gossip mill like you might find in the south in small towns and so forth that would 
make people feel more like they have to be on their best behavior and so those things like anonymity 
mobility and diversity are really they really are levers toward looseness so i think important any time we try 
analyze a context is to kinda look at it generally its ecology its structure and then try to make 
based on multiple factors because that way we can be more accurate in our estimations sc that actually clears 
up because i was going to ask about rather than a statebystate analysis is there an urban versus rural 
of divide and i might have guessed on the basis of the singapore example that urban environments would be 
but they also would tend to be more diverse so an obvious difference between new york or los angeles 
a place like singapore which i know the demographics perfectly but betting less diverse mg yeah yeah right i 
these are really important questions again we can analyze singapore and look at it a place that is entirely 
nowhere to go in singapore chuckle a city also three different ethnic groups there and so when if really 
a context where you go anywhere hugely densely populated it makes a lot of sense to have strict rules 
help people coordinate what lee kuan knew said in his autobiography he looked at their ecology in terms of 
of arable land in terms of high density in terms you escape this place so better have rules that 
us coordinate and to get along other things that you can look at to predict tightness in urban areas 
again i think in general urban areas should be looser they tend to be more diverse and they tend 
have more mobility but not always for example in a recent paper in pnas the proceedings of the national 
of sciences that was mapping the provinces in china on tightloose using our measures they found some super interesting 
where the urban areas were way tighter than the rural areas in china mg and because again really densely 
having incredible influxes of people from the countryside and the government was saying we gotta have rules here we 
security cameras everywhere we have ways to track social credit score to make sure they behave because it could 
completely chaotic when you when away from beijing you are far away from the kinda big eyes upon you 
can be looser in china and so lots of different factors that predict tightloose within a nation this work 
really just starting up that in twenty years have even more finegrained predictions around context based on all these 
of factors sc a lot of this distinction between tight and loose relates to how closely we follow social 
as said which is by definition a social collective kind of phenomenon but the traits that mentioning do seem 
they might have reflections in just individual psychology right are there tight and loose people is that a personality 
mg such a good question and been kind of wary of using the same labels to talk about individuals 
you do about cultures we did this with collectivism and it caused a lot of levels of analysis problems 
do you think about collectivist individuals and whole collectivist nations so i think about it as what individual level 
are needed or cultivated to fit into and support the strength of norms you have strong norms without people 
are behaving in ways that support them or likewise you have weaker norms like when out in public parks 
having individual attributes that fit into them and make them up mg and so for example i would say 
sort of tight mindset and i found evidence for this with certain measures is that in tighter cultures you 
to socialize your kids to follow rules to have more selfmonitoring to kind of notice rules and monitor your 
in order to fit into them in looser cultures you need to have those skills as much you could 
low selfmonitors we know a lot of these people around us who were doing weird things all the time 
even notice it in loose cultures you can have less impulse control because not afraid of punishments whereas in 
cultures you have to monitor impulses mg so in china and japan and other tighter cultures taught from a 
young age that you should be monitoring your impulses and being aware of how fitting in to the norms 
the flip side in loose cultures you need to have a lot of tolerance for ambiguity because gonna enter 
lot of weird situations where people are doing some strange stuff so you have to be tolerant of those 
so measured these kinds of things things like selfmonitoring or impulse control how much trying to prevent making mistakes 
much do you like structure or do you like ambiguity and all these things at the individual level through 
we call multilevel analysis are connected to the larger cultural context in general even though all cultures have people 
have variation on these attributes mg clearly a connection with how training our kids to be good cultural citizens 
terms of those psychological attributes so i will say that i have a one last thing on this i 
a tightloose mindset quiz that you could take on my website that again kind measuring these attributes of selfmonitoring 
control preventionfocused need for order actually just one metaphor that comes from the muppets dahlia lithwick had used this 
order versus chaos muppets so like ernie and bert and cookie monster and animal and they vary really predictably 
how much they like rules versus how much doing crazy things and one way to think about it at 
individual level is that yes each of us do have a default setting we as i mentioned we adapt 
situations very easily when they change in the strength of norms but you can imagine the conflicts that happen 
i veer sort of looser my a lawyer he veers tighter and we have to negotiate this a lot 
with our kids so a whole other story but kind of a long answer to your question that i 
say yes at the individual level we can find differences but i would say that more about mindsets than 
some personality one personality difference sc well and there must be a sort of nature versus nurture question here 
well i mean how much does just having to happening to be born in a tight or loose culture 
your personality traits that are relevant here as growing up mg such a good question i and we really 
data on this we have some genetic evidence about what kinds of genes might be more likely to be 
in contexts that have a lot of ecological threat in terms of disasters and invasions and things like that 
the short allele but correlational data and now kind of starting to work with some people looking at culturegene 
to see how do these things reinforce each other because particularly in some contexts that have had threat over 
you would imagine that certain traits might be selected for because more adaptable in certain context at the same 
i wanna mention that tight and loose are really dynamic constructs and i was mentioning that threat is a 
predictor of tightness and measured that chronically over one hundred years but i can activate threat in my laboratory 
about population density or pathogens or invasions and people instantly tighten up even if fake threat chuckle mg i 
these are the silly experiments that psychologists do i mean they last very long but we see this very 
the same principle you could see that very quickly and people can tighten up when they feel threat whether 
or imagined and fascinating we found this in some of our computational models is that when you reduce threat 
takes much longer for people to loosen up kind of this asymmetry that we see in multiple models that 
we try to model this with artificial people we could see that it takes much longer to go from 
to loose than from loose to tight sc interesting so like we mg so i think sc we our 
can be activated very easily but then it takes time to calm down once again mg exactly i think 
about human nature around being kind of preventionfocused or riskavoidant when but a really interesting question now trying to 
experiments to figure out how do you loosen up a context getting too tight and too tight artificially because 
i mentioned we know the tradeoff of tightloose is orderopenness in general and we know that when cultures are 
tight really synchronized they have a lot of order but they start becoming more ethnocentric and they lose out 
innovation and creativity and on adaptability so we wanna be artificially tight and where i think some of the 
recent work trying to do is how to really kind of help facilitate that in a world where while 
threat seem to be decreasing of course we have to be vigilant but compared to hundreds of years ago 
steven pinker would argue we seem to be feeling more threatened just based on social media and based on 
rhetoric that we see propagated through our leaders through the internet mg by the way we just recently created 
new computational dictionary to assess threat in social media to then track happening when we see a lot of 
in presidential speeches or in facebook or otherwise how is that predicting in realtime changes in creativity or openness 
other things because we think that a lot of that big data that can be harnessed to kinda understand 
psychology of threat and tightness out there in the cyber world sc am i remembering correctly there were some 
done with i forget whether it was you who were doing them or just quoting them that sort of 
even at a very early age these differences between openness and closeness mg yeah this is our first experiment 
young children which are a generalist so study anything if if the method helps us to understand the phenomenon 
yeah mg and we were in this case interested in cultural differences and tightloose across different social classes and 
argument that we and we were building on melvin kohn a famous sociologist who wrote a book class and 
in the late we were arguing that the working class should be tighter because worried about falling into poverty 
they have a lot of more threats when it comes to occupations in terms of danger or neighborhoods or 
rules to help kids stay safe but we ever systematically looked at this across the working and upper class 
class the argument is that they can afford to break rules the whole country tends to be organized around 
and i even have these crazy books that are all like create anarchy for chuckle sc yeah yeah mg 
actually good advice for people who have a cushion who have a safety sc privileged things yeah mg where 
can make mistakes with the working class you have that because you could be really super poor living in 
which is actually normless in many ways as durkheim would say so we started to look at this in 
working class and middle class and first we started asking adults do you think about we just asked people 
think about following the rules what comes to mind breaking the rules what comes to mind and we found 
really interesting pattern that the working class that thought rules are good they provide structure they are safe and 
the upper class middle and upper class were like a nuisance goody twoshoes was associated with what you think 
when you think about kind of middle and upper class america and we wanted to see how early these 
arise so we brought into the lab and you exactly ask what do you think of laughter mg chuckle 
how normgoverned are you yeah mg they just look at us like i mean even my teenagers might say 
we can use this paradigm that was actually developed by michael tomasello a developmental psychologist and fascinating you basically 
have kids play with a puppet so playing with a puppet max the puppet and befriending the puppet playing 
games with new rules and all of a sudden max does something kind of weird he starts violating the 
and i would say playing the game but clearly like max the norm violator suddenly and you can these 
and see how do they react and exactly what myself and jesse harrington did we found really interesting differences 
was the working class kids that got more upset with max the puppet when he violated the rules they 
him to stop they were upset about this again in general the upper class kids they were more likely 
laugh they would let max off the hook even by age and again when we measure parental attitudes about 
we see that the working class parents who think rules are really important their implicit theories around rules are 
good needed functional mg so this was kind of something super interesting for us is to start looking at 
kind of developmental perspective on this we started to now design some work on neuroscience and development to peer 
the brain and to see happening as people were witnessing max the puppet violating rules happening as early as 
years old we know that in later adulthood people from different tight and loose cultures are processing norm violations 
in the brain and we wanna see how how early can we start seeing those differences kids really start 
about norms and rules really really early what we know from developmental psychology is even before they have language 
have been found when watching puppets doing weird things they avoid them and when they watch puppets that are 
they start reaching for them chuckle so crazy interesting to think about us as a species rules are just 
important but been really studied but really super important all countries need rules you can imagine a context where 
following any rules be completely chaotic and unpredictable and so why we could see this happening so early such 
important aspect of our human sociality sc so telling me that all of the hollywood stereotypes about rich kids 
think that the rules apply to them are just the truth laughter mg well you know interesting i think 
probably curvilinear i think actually curvilinear but we just have the power to detect it sc sure mg but 
think about victorian england like super super rich old rich and these are places that had very strict rules 
never surveyed them but put the college education funds on that for the kids laughter mg and a very 
bet because i have a kid in college now sc yeah well yes mg but i think that also 
i said super poor we think are really loose to the extent that normlessness and what the working class 
trying to avoid so probably some nonlinear patterns but we been able to detect that yet we have access 
some of these samples but what i would sort of speculate on sc well mentioned several times the research 
done the papers that you publish and so forth so just methodologically what does that involve how do you 
the amount of openness closeness looseness tightness in different cultures through space and time mg yeah this is a 
question and i think that in any science using multiple methods is really important to be able to see 
you have converging patterns particularly when you do crossculture research so many kind of rival hypotheses even the way 
word a question or translations or the person giving you the survey might elicit a different response there was 
interesting data that showed that if in in hong kong if a study was being told as it was 
in hong kong versus it was funded in mainland china it changed responses just very subtle ways that you 
change responses in the laboratory in surveys on obtrusive observations across cultures i wrote a whole paper on just 
many rival hypotheses you have to rule out during crossculture research laughter mg and i think if the editors 
that no gonna wanna do crossculture research if they read this paper chuckle sc there you go mg and 
said such and i also make so many mistakes doing crossculture research and now get to the answer but 
one funny story think that not such a schmuck been doing this for twentyfive years but i still fail 
anticipate how culture will kind of manifest itself in the method and so in that study where i sent 
around the world with these facial warts or with the tattoos this was through a humboldt grant and we 
them in bremen in germany to go back to their home countries and it was legal it was ethical 
was totally kosher to do these kinds of interventions wearing these crazy things on their faces but what i 
was that as people get back to their countries even if they were standardized they just one by one 
tightness of the the students they wrote me they said just do this i bring myself to do this 
too embarrassing and just too worried to do and exactly what studying how i anticipate that is just ridiculous 
so just to say i wrote a paper about all the mistakes made the schmuck moves made as a 
psychologist i want other younger scholars to realize really not easy you even realize it how easy culture becomes 
of the method mg so anyway back to your main question was i try to use lots of different 
sometimes i use surveys and i ask people to directly answer questions about the construct and about what they 
to be the strength or weakness of situations in the environment permissible for example we might ask how permissible 
it to sing or to dance or to burp or to eat in an elevator or in a party 
in a library and we can then assess across countries the range of behavior that seems permissible we could 
reliably that tighter cultures they tend to say no much less permissible or we in more recent work we 
ethnographies so these are now hundreds of pages of documents in the standard sample called these are preindustrial societies 
ask people questions in these contexts we observe them but luckily anthropologists have detailed these societies to incredible amount 
depth and we can then i wanna say this gave me a lot of gray hair but this took 
years of work to train people to actually code ethnographies we can code them in different domains of life 
have lots of details on socialization how are kids socialized mg they have lots of details on funerals on 
on gender on legal systems and we can code those for the strength of norms and we can then 
do through a factor analysis is there any kind of coherence and exactly what we showed and remarkably other 
assessed how threatened these contexts are in terms of natural resources in terms of invasions and we see very 
patterns in the ethnographic record and i say this within a minute and a half but this took as 
mentioned five years this project chuckle and that was finally under review or like i mentioned we can go 
and have people interact with people in public settings or we can measure the degree of monitoring by police 
another indicator so we try to use many methods including more recently i mentioned computational modeling because we wanna 
predictions about the evolution of this construct and hard to do with laboratory experiments or with singlestudy onetime crosssectional 
of data even more recently we started developing dictionaries of tightloose with people in linguistics where we can track 
time the language people use in newspapers and in books mg and we could see for example the us 
the last two hundred years in a paper we just published in nature human behaviour is actually loosened up 
a bit starting to tighten up in our data but it has had a trend of being much looser 
terms of the words people use in common vernacular anyway a longwinded answer to just say that never met 
method we like and love to partner with some physicists at some point and we work with biologists we 
with now mathematicians and computer scientists and neuroscientists but i have to say sadly never met a physicist we 
with but not out of the range of possibilities sc no not at all but it also makes me 
are there differences between academic disciplines in the amount of tightness or mg definitely sc either faculty or students 
yeah definitely my colleague ben schneider would say that people make the place in organizations and no doubt we 
that people who are attracted to certain disciplines have already different values different personality differences people attracted to economics 
very different than psychology and so i think that something we studied systematically we started to do some again 
analysis just a fancy way of saying simplified patterns with data with the department of onet database which tracks 
every single occupation they have on this onet website the knowledge skills and abilities that you need for that 
and also the kind of work context you have in terms of what interested threat coordination versus experimentation and 
to dig into that database to show patterns of which occupations tend to be tighter or looser and it 
a lot of sense the same principles can apply to understanding occupations as well and important because you might 
realize your own mindset might not fit with that occupation mg my husband is a lawyer law firms and 
and other types of fields where a lot of accountability which is a big driver of tightness they need 
veer tighter keep sc sure that means perfect sense mg in a context where much less accountability per se 
obviously feel personally accountable but very big differences in gonna fit those occupations and i think navigated to the 
balance in terms of order and openness with academia that is not found in other contexts sc well but 
because there are these multiple factors that come into it and i think me living my whole life in 
settings is just the natural thing for me to think about but if thinking of an english literature major 
intuitive feeling is that a looseness associated with that culture on the other hand maybe under threat maybe they 
as much social cache or funding or whatever so not sure that my intuition is pointing in the right 
mg yeah interesting we actually studied those contexts but i do think that we could assess these reliably and 
to understand them i would say academia is an interesting context in terms of what i call the goldilocks 
of tightloose because we need to have both loose elements and tight elements in our toolbox in order to 
it in academia and we need to have looseness in the sense that that helps us to create ideas 
we need to have some tightness because that helps us to implement those ideas and to scale up and 
actually get them to actually go to fruition and so i think actually academic life involves fundamentally both tight 
loose mindsets and in fact in business the most innovative companies and the most innovative countries we found again 
a balance of tight and loose because some loose cultures and companies can really do great at creativity but 
they suffer when they try to implement things think tesla i wrote an oped recently like is a great 
place and brilliant but they need some tightness to scale up chuckle mg and sure not getting a lot 
fans out there tesla fans but on the flip side you can sc by the way i can say 
as a matter of data i visited tesla been on the factory floor no sorry sorry making this up 
visited spacex mg oh chuckle sc so i presume a similar command and control structure but it is the 
factory ever seen chuckle sc and maybe space x is different than tesla in this way but not very 
goosey there the spacex factory mg yeah a lot of manufacturing contexts veer tighter because they need to be 
to coordinate and have more efficiency and again the companies that are most what i mean by innovative is 
you not just have good ideas but you can actually scale them up have to do both they need 
who can effortlessly switch gears and hard because the people who are attracted to startups tend to have loose 
and talked to some startupers they call themselves serial startupers because once they start scaling up or get bought 
they like the rules like i gotta get out of here i stand this regulation that has to come 
scaling and vice versa tight companies they are really good at implementing things but they might not be good 
coming up with really cool creative ideas and so this is where the tightloose tradeoff comes into play to 
really super innovative you need both mindsets and we could see at the national level that really that balance 
having some balance of tightloose that can help countries be innovative sc well that definitely seems to be a 
of your book that some aristotelian mean here between being too tight and too loose on the one hand 
looser culture might be more creative and open but on the other hand they will also have more crime 
so presumably some intermediate stage where everything is the best to compromise but hard to find maybe mg hunky 
chuckle yeah i i would yeah i would say that groups need to veer tight or loose for good 
reasons where we see variation with social class with organizations comparing united versus tesla or nations but the groups 
get too extreme in any direction that start having really big problems and we showed this in the paper 
published that the relationship between tightloose is curvilinear with a lot of outcomes and the idea is simple groups 
get extraordinarily loose predict behavior and they become very chaotic whereas groups that are really tight are very repressive 
called this sort of anomic suicide when it comes to becoming too loose he use the term loose but 
would say what he was talking about or too fatalistic in terms of suicide if they get so repressive 
we actually show that the extremely loose and extremely tight cultures that have high suicide rates or have low 
or have high degrees of depression and low happiness and one example of this in terms of dynamics is 
the dynamics happening in egypt often systems go between these extremes and egypt is a good example of a 
where it was supertight a very high degree of oppression and control mg when mubarak was ousted the system 
to the exact opposite went basically to the other extreme and people were screaming in the streets at first 
then suddenly it was like this place is chaotic we do anything and coordinate and predict each and there 
a lot of chaos and what we found in our surveys in egypt at the time is that the 
perceived that chaos really wanted another autocratic regime in place again they were wanting to have the salafis or 
muslim brotherhood take over because that extreme looseness that chaos that ensued after taking out this topdown control without 
kind of mesolevel institutions picking up the pieces it produces what i call autocratic recidivism it produces this exact 
pattern and for americans it seems so puzzling but for us as crosscultural psychologists it because when chaos in 
extreme looseness context whether in the philippines or in russia or anywhere or if just perceived people want tightness 
kind of functional in many ways but often we see people and groups overshooting in that tightness and then 
have problems at the other extreme chuckle so not painting a great rosy picture but at least we can 
dynamics through the lens of norms and often we think about other factors structural factors sc maybe it should 
sense to us maybe the us is a little bit atypical in how close been to the medium over 
but in european history i think we can certainly see these wild oscillations back and forth whether the french 
or weimar germany where you go from very loose to very tight and trying to find that middle ground 
be harder than it sounds in theory mg yeah i think right i think right now trying to do 
more work in ancient history looking at the evolution of tight and loose working with peter turchin at uconn 
evolutionary biologist and developed this great database called seshat trying to mathematize history in really incredibly interesting ways again 
timeconsuming and so forth but we wanna try to look at this more systematically to see how does tightloose 
to resilience and stability and change over hundreds and thousands of years i mean not a new concept relevant 
been on earth that groups develop rules and the strictness with which we adhere to them varies so we 
go even further back to trace exactly what talking about mg and the us an interesting place a baby 
been separated by two oceans from the rest of the world had some conflict obviously of course actually my 
daughter now some years ago she asked me if i was worried about canada and mexico invading us and 
course some people might answer that differently now but like i thought it was the funniest thing we take 
granted of course some pockets of the us that have more natural disasters and more pathogens and more scarcity 
they tend to be tighter in our data but nevertheless i think that struggling now as a nation with 
much threat is real and how much perceived because perceived threat has this very similar impact and what we 
finding in some of our research is that people are vastly overestimating threats even based on actual data for 
on illegal immigrants mg people vastly overestimate the problem and they also vastly overestimate how much groups who come 
this country as just one threat are gonna be loosening the fabric of this country in fact immigrants found 
are more likely to pay attention to rules and so just something now that in very new territory and 
to negotiate tightloose in the us based on objective threat sc i mean this talk about how well we 
to the norms is kind almost puts to the background the question of what the norms are and maybe 
it completely neutral as to what the choice of norms are whether you obey them or not i had 
podcast conversation with nicholas christakis where he mentioned a tiny culture that somehow it had developed a norm against 
love so that you you know there was this norm that you would just sort of have sex with 
partners for a couple of weeks and then move on to someone else and there were always these young 
who would run away and get married like romeo and juliet but i mean maybe it matter what the 
are but is there some relationship with what kind of norms there are versus how tight or loose a 
is mg yeah so interesting i mean this is what we studied with the standard sample data we were 
the strength of norms in gender and sexuality and funerals and ethics and we found that a lot of 
that when norm sent to restrict rules and behavior in one domain like in gender or sexuality they tend 
also restrict them in other domains there tends to that mean that some i mean every culture has tight 
loose elements if they then gonna like i mentioned have serious problems even japan one of the tightest cultures 
our data has context where people go crazy in terms of drinking and not weird video games and things 
that iran a very tight culture has an underground of looseness so we can find pockets of it in 
country in any context but we do tend to find that there tends to be a spillover effect in 
domains of life and now starting to develop scales that try to assess different domains of tightness when it 
to language or to gender or how you treat authorities or public behavior in public settings so that we 
start to really map this profiles in different groups mg but as i said so far seen a lot 
coherence in terms of that domains tend to have tightness have a logic in terms of being permissive or 
your question really though i think is also about how do we judge other cultures for their norms and 
is really difficult a feminist but also a crosscultural psychologist and i tend to have some ethical issues around 
because i wanna be open to the fact that different cultures have different rules and that evolved for different 
and that we just judge them with our own sort of glasses at the same time i think that 
believe that when it comes to physical harm i would say no i would judge that norm to say 
physical harm is inflicted on women or girls or whatnot that a problem and i think where i would 
my line mg but often i think the case that we have to still understand where these traditions come 
and how to negotiate them happening a lot now in the international development world fascinating because a lot of 
these organizations have gone into africa and other contexts trying to change behavior whether genital cutting or whether breastfeeding 
early childhood marriage and they come in and they just try to change attitudes and they recognize that starting 
recognize now a huge movement going on in that world that really norms that you can change attitudes but 
strong norms against these practices you gotta understand where they came from and how to negotiate those underlying values 
support those norms because in those contexts you could change attitudes all you want but people still will be 
about being punished for changing them so something i also talk about toward the end of the book in 
of that international development world and tightloose sc yeah speaking of which is there a relationship between tightloose and 
or isolationism i mean how welcoming we are not just to happening in our norms in our local environment 
to completely other cultures is there an openness i expect as asking the question i think answering it also 
yeah sc i would imagine that looser cultures are also more open to mingling with other cultures mg yeah 
i mean definitely a strong connection because those the loose i think actually looseness is really about having a 
of diversity in many contexts and you really agree on one norm that will guide behavior so it automatically 
that kind of openness to other cultures and i would say that a lot of the conflict we have 
the world these days is kind of on the axis of tightloose this kind of context where in any 
that are feeling a lot of threat and that wanna turn inward and that are largely feeling the threat 
globalization and immigration as compared to the context in every country where people thrive on diversity and openness mg 
i think what we need to do is understand each perspectives where do these threats come from a lot 
the work that done showed that people who feel a lot of threat whether from isis or from economics 
tend to think the system is too loose worried about the permissiveness in the country and that in turn 
in part explaining their vote for people like trump or le pen or brexit and so i think we 
to not think about this as some puzzle in history when people feel threatened and happening a lot in 
manufacturing i just drove through michigan recently i was just amazed to see the ghost towns that exist and 
think that not really thinking about how do we actually help people feel less threatened mg in the book 
talk about the working class in the united states where loose culture we tend to actually have structures to 
the working class in germany by contrast which is tighter there are standardized procedures to help the working class 
are ways to have a certificate to go back between different companies more of a helping system that is 
to help connect people in local communities to educators to businesses and really helpful because then we can ward 
that threat but as long as we just kind of think that we could just let people fend for 
it makes it really hard in context where increasing economic competition and globalization and so forth sc but you 
germany as a tight culture so in some sense that this is a strategy that a tight culture can 
to make things easier and alleviate that threat if they make it easier to go back and forth between 
is that the idea mg yeah a whole structure in germany where when tracked into a vocational type of 
versus college education a whole system to help people to actually really thrive in those contexts is my understanding 
in terms of being able to have these certificates that are standardized that help you go between different types 
companies and not the case you have to relearn a lot and i think fascinating we just in the 
interviewed some people on in manufacturing context that wanna loosen up be more creative where they have a lot 
people from the working class that have been in these companies they understand that this is not gonna be 
easy to just switch suddenly to becoming this creative person chuckle mg like remember how far back it goes 
at least three years old people realize that very difficult to go from tight to loose and i have 
stories about this in the book where clearly people recognize sometimes we gotta really tighten up we gotta loosen 
real threats that people perceive on either vantage point when trying to tighten up groups feel like a real 
threat to autonomy and i talked to bob herbold who talked me microsoft when he tried to tighten up 
they were kind of chaotic that he got a lot of pushback or on the flip side when trying 
loosen up things too quickly people feel a sense of unpredictability and they feel loss of control so the 
leaders try to help deal with those needs and also patient americans are not exactly known for our patience 
this about us studied in american and patience but these things take time mg and they also take a 
of patience because as noticed with some places interviewed when companies like manufacturing trying to loosen up they tend 
bring in a loose unit who is gonna help them become more creative but then they have all these 
clashes because they really stand each other they have a lot of problems with each other the loose group 
being too controlling the tight group thinks that the new group is missing deadlines and is just really unpredictable 
i talk quite a bit about different strategies for that helping to negotiate these differences but it definitely helps 
know the language and to understand the psychology of tight and loose to help do that sc yeah no 
think just being aware of the dimension and how important it is can be very helpful you mentioned italy 
while back i was in italy just a month or so ago and just trying to get to the 
on time much less trying to get food once we were in the restaurant was a real challenge to 
americans who were like is the taxi we ordered an hour laughter sc and like get here what are 
worried and i think that you make the point that maybe if aware of attuned to these differences then 
could be very helpful whether a visitor or an immigrant or just someone who is getting to know a 
kind of society to not judge them by your standards mg yeah right actually a really good example because 
veers loose in our data but there are a couple of domains i discovered that are really super tight 
italy and i wonder if this resonates with your experience and one of them food is pretty tight you 
parmesan cheese on fish and pasta or else gonna get some really strange looks and i actually did some 
on this and i got some really bad looks when i was trying to do that fashion is pretty 
and interesting and what i proven this scientifically but my guess is that domains that are really really important 
a culture that are valued really highly like in italy fashion and food they tend to be pretty regulated 
they have a lot of strong norms around them and the same is in other cultures like in new 
really pretty loose but certain domains that are really tight mg and because those domains are really super important 
one of them is egalitarianism a great phrase called knocking down tall poppies in australia and new zealand which 
really pretty highly regulated like if you try to stand out in these contexts get some pushback and so 
general a loose context but some domains that get to be highly normatized because they are trying to protect 
but nevertheless i agree that understanding these differences is really important we call it really trying to increase cultural 
in our field we have this kind of iq concept we have eq emotional intelligence but we know from 
literature that distinct constructs you can have all the iq and eq and be really bad in terms of 
intelligence mg you could speak lots of languages and still be culturally unintelligent and scales and measures that you 
assess and fascinating to me again to the point that culture is invisible is that still the case that 
lot of times we send people abroad even for big assignments whether in global management or the state department 
for international types of negotiations and we anticipate wait does this person match that culture are they trained to 
go to this we sort of promote people based on their technical expertise in the us and we send 
abroad and we know from our data that harder to adapt to tight cultures but that people who have 
kind of tighter mindset that we talked about tend to do better we actually just published a paper on 
that you can identify the kind of people that might do better at tight or loose cultures andor train 
to understand these differences because it costs a lot of money in early return and certainly in stress when 
go to cultures and have a lot of shock around these issues that could have been anticipated sc and 
to bring it home i mean i think you also mentioned that there could be implications forget about other 
just to think about the workplace or your home life or your social circles where you recognize either different 
or different aspects of how you get together that reflect this tightness or looseness like i presume that theoretical 
overall are gonna be pretty loose about things like our job is to think of theories of the universe 
you gotta get certain things done on time right still in an environment where there are rules and maybe 
people respond to that differently mg yeah exactly right i think that when i start analyzing conflicts around me 
with your spouse or with your kids your colleagues or even on i just got back from vacation and 
like rears its ugly head on vacation all the time the kind of people that love structure want everything 
wanna get up at the crack of dawn and then sc oh yeah mg the loose mindset very spontaneous 
they both have their advantages but i find that fascinating whether on vacations or whether your spouse or your 
that helpful is to negotiate the differences and we know from the negotiation literature that you gotta identify your 
like what are the domains if loose what can you not give up on in terms of your looseness 
if tight what are the domains that are must for you and then negotiate the rest and i actually 
this with my kids it sounds kind of crazy and probably they actually know a lot about crosscultural psychology 
our household we sort of think about what are the domains that we have to be strict in and 
turns out to be like schoolwork and health and how they treat each other but then other domains that 
could be a little more lax about like how messy the house is or their bedtime or their curfew 
a way to kind of think i mean sure my husband thinks the house is a total mess a 
tidier it drives him crazy sc but again to the extent that you can kinda think about what are 
priorities and then talk them through and actively negotiate renegotiate them that can actually help same with vacations like 
on what day you were gonna be tight or loose or what context if you have the vocabulary you 
start talking about it and i find that to be pretty exciting because we can harness these differences and 
more productive in our daily lives have less conflict in our relationships sc just getting more and more evidence 
i do these podcasts in very different subjects that there really was something to this whole mg yup sc 
thing there are extremes that have their virtues and somewhere in not even necessarily some algorithmic formula for where 
between but there is a happy medium mg yeah fascinating i also became really obsessed with this concept because 
years people were asking better freedom or constraint plato sc exactly mg and confucius they were like we need 
then you have like hobbes and hobbes also who thought we need rules he thought pretty negative view of 
world and then you had people like john stuart mill or freud who felt like rules are problematic and 
me not about which is better about the balance and i found a lot of evidence outside of my 
for that principle parenting is a good example where we know that parents that are too strict or too 
produce maladaptive kids so the kind of curvilinear goldilocks thing that you just referred to or we know that 
again if too tight or too loose you start having a lot of problems and i even stumbled into 
phenomena in the brain that when you have too much synchrony in the brain between regions or too little 
it produces different brain disorders so a lot to be said about that principle beyond just national cultures and 
explore it in a chapter called the goldilocks effect but sure lots of other examples that we stumbled into 
this is great i think this is of the podcasts done this is a nice golden mean between being 
giant theory of how everything works and actually practical advice for lives mg oh glad to hear that i 
know that some people like the grand theories because they feel like simplifying the world and i guess for 
i think good to have multiple theories about the world and then use them because not one grand theory 
will explain culture but the more we understand these kind of subtheories the better off be in the world 
i think that in this globalized world we we need more cultural intelligence and we need to move beyond 
kind of simple distinctions of redblue eastwest to get to those gists of culture increasingly important and if we 
figure that out then be in a better place to build a better world is the idea sc yeah 
the mindscape podcast is a safe space for grand theories of everything so come to the right place mg 
sc michele gelfand thanks so much for being on the podcast mg thank you for having me music lovely 
brought several questions to mind first how does a culture change where it lies on the tightloose spectrum for 
i grew up in oregon in the and no one ever even considered was a pretty tight culture now 
has become a very loose culture and many people cross the street wherever and whenever convenient second given that 
history of threat and a dense relatively homogeneous population moves a culture toward the tighter dimension why is the 
such a loose culture given that it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and 
was invaded and treated abominably by the germans during world war ii great episode thank you so much for 
us these fascinating discussions another interesting episode and i would offer just a few comments although i understand that 
is as they say all relative i think many of our top universities have become too tight relative to 
speech norms imposed by its liberal student body and a middle point as suggested is often the balanced medium 
the tightnessloose scale there was a commercial on this site but i did bounce between the two for a 
and i care i like great courses and this is important mg was an alexander von humboldt award winner 
everyone should take a moment to google him as he was a fascinating historical figure what are the precursors 
this in animal societies animal personality ranges at least clearly ai beings will need such an adaptive capability can 
be installed as coherent construct or must it be developed empirically via a computerbased societal evolution simulation derivative of
