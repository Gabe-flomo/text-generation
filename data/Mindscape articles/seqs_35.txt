usually what talking about is something really different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so
what talking about is something really different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so if
talking about is something really different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so if we
about is something really different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so if we go
is something really different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so if we go back
something really different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so if we go back in
really different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so if we go back in time
different called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter and denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now and cooling and so if we go back in time we

a star and so it was fusing elements together and making helium and lithium and a little bit of other things out of hydrogen and so we can figure out what the abundance of those elements should be in the universe if that were taking place and it matches really well
star and so it was fusing elements together and making helium and lithium and a little bit of other things out of hydrogen and so we can figure out what the abundance of those elements should be in the universe if that were taking place and it matches really well and
and so it was fusing elements together and making helium and lithium and a little bit of other things out of hydrogen and so we can figure out what the abundance of those elements should be in the universe if that were taking place and it matches really well and so
so it was fusing elements together and making helium and lithium and a little bit of other things out of hydrogen and so we can figure out what the abundance of those elements should be in the universe if that were taking place and it matches really well and so there
it was fusing elements together and making helium and lithium and a little bit of other things out of hydrogen and so we can figure out what the abundance of those elements should be in the universe if that were taking place and it matches really well and so there are
