happening out there in the world and i remember i think that in my very first podcast teaser trailer 
mindscape i talked about this issue of what we pay attention to there are an infinite number of facts 
in the world which ones do you notice which ones do you communicate to other people you and i 
that every day everything we think about the world outside our immediate senses is shaped by information brought to

show episode transcript sc but if a news organization your choices in this matter are incredibly important and as 
turns out as we will hear in interview the news organizations that make these choices always do so for 
datadriven reasons there are some executives at a news organization and they have preferences and those preferences decide what 
hear so guest is jessica yellin been a very wellknown reporter in various formats perhaps most notably as the 
white house correspondent at cnn for quite a while but now jessica has left that all behind she thinks 
we need a new way of delivering the news and trying to pioneer different efforts herself including an instagram 
feed that you can all subscribe to also written a book called savage news which is a novel a 
disguised thinly fictionalized account of various scandalous things going on in the news world and this is a very 
conversation because we have to understand what learning about the world how we should interpret it and so forth 
when so much information coming in so go music sc jessica yellin welcome to the mindscape podcast jessica yellin 
for having me this is exciting sc yeah it kind of is exciting definitely exciting for me because we 
someone like you on the podcast before but i know you personally a little bit and interested both in 
of what the job is that you do telling the news but then also given how the podcast works 
theory behind how the news worked and how you think about it so you did various jobs for abc 
cnn political correspondent chief white house correspondent help the audience out a little bit by just saying what is 
the day in the life like when an onair correspondent for big a news organization how much time do 
spend writing reporting being on air and stuff like that jy so very different when at the white house 
being in any other role when i was paying my dues working my way up i was in local 
in orlando covering fires and murders and that kind of thing and then i got to good morning america 
i covered even more gruesome murders lots of tabloids celebrity scandals and that life is just nonstop go your 
beeps and at dinner or on a date i was young and you just have to stand up and 
booked me on a flight to kentucky in two hours i gotta go sc yes i did interview for 
podcast a chemist who works on forensic chemistry of murder so she uses chemistry to help find murder victims 
a murder theme this quarter on mindscape jy sorry if gruesome but it was an excruciatingly difficult life in 
of travel and that kind of thing when you get to the white house different and you have a 
pass which is what everybody who works in the white house has and this class system about what color 
your hard pass we had the blue hard pass sc are there soft passes i know what a hard 
is jy so interesting no it is hard so like a click you can click it with your finger 
and you wear around your neck at all times and so you get your hard pass and you swipe 
every day and you walk through the secret service security shack just like every other person working in the 
house and you go into called the brady press briefing room you know it you see it on tv 
the part you see behind the scenes is where we physically work a warren of cubicles in a windowless 
with a basement where you have almost no room and a box you work in basically a closet with 
other people four other reporters and producers in a box taking calls and maniacally juggling everything going on sc 
presume that what seen on the west wing is more or less completely accurate right jy of course not 
from reality except now with social media everything is at super speed sc yeah okay jy so you have 
up you have instagram everything up all the time monitoring it and especially when at a channel when i 
at cnn constantly racing to the camera to get something on fast sc right jy and so just fight 
flight all the time sc and your news when the white house correspondent is your news basically what comes 
you in that briefing room jy separate that what comes to you very hard to enterprise a story which 
when you generate a story that you find on your own because the flood of incoming is so intense 
what happens in the briefing room is usually the least relevant thing kabuki theater sc what i thought yeah 
it is so much about letting me ask the best question that i can use on camera far more 
how do i frame this to get the best answer sc i see so i thought that the kabuki 
is coming from the press officers giving you the briefing but saying the reporters are just as much part 
this jy in the game sc because cameras everywhere and you wanna be on camera what is your goal 
you were playing this game let say say you were enthusiastically playing along you wanted to become the highestpaid 
on cnn what kinds of questions would you be asking jy well you ask the threeparter why you x 
so and so said this is that really your answer so that you keep cutting them off so that 
twoway because the way tv news is structured now all about conflict the powers that be have decided viewers 
conflict so you ask this long question or the even short question that elicits a substantive answer you find 
debate the friction so the goal is in that scenario how do i get that me acting tough on 
sc but you do a lot of reporting other than in that briefing room jy yeah just the show 
and then you have to go back to your booth in your little cubicle and just dial you call 
texting emailing all day the white house each administration dealt with has become increasingly more difficult to cover because 
tightly held until this one which is public sc special chuckle special in many ways jy as long as 
have to do with putin but public purport calling congress you need to triangulate you find sources outside the 
house who tell you what they know is going on inside then you call inside to say know this 
wanna correct or you sometimes we have access to part of the white house so you can walk into 
of it where the communications team is and linger and try to get information and then the whole scene 
happens on the driveway where everyone comes out and you do questions but the real reporting is stuff you 
on camera sc sure and in a room with four other people at least are you listening to who 
chuckle jy of course always the craziest thing because you want to hold your information but in a space 
you cannot so one of the things that happens is see a lot of white house reporters pacing on 
driveway sc i see when talking to jy talking to someone and like sleeting and snowing but your only 
sc yeah okay very good but is there a lot of time outside the white house also jy well 
the president travels you travel or somebody in your team travels so sometimes on air force one you fly 
force one sometimes on the support plane the charter and then yeah out about around town back at the 
sometimes you do go into the country to do a story and then the white house correspondent becomes the 
reporter on the campaign so then you sc i was gonna ask about the campaign or the conventions these 
special events where your mode is a little bit different jy well once the campaign starts bye white house 
jy when i went on the two thousand eight campaign i covered obama i left for that at the 
of november two thousand seven with a suitcase and the first time i came home to repack my suitcase 
in march sc wow jy and sometimes flying to a different city or state every day sc and this 
does that this is just what signed up for jy everyone does this yeah sc and do people do 
for years and years and years chuckle jy it gets really exhausting sc yeah i can imagine jy at 
point say is my life gonna do for me i said had that experience chuckle i keep doing sc 
what counts as a story is this the initiative of the neutral reporters jy well this is the question 
to me one of the most important questions who decides what counts as news my frustration in the news 
in my experience was that the reporter on the ground witnessing the events has too little influence in deciding 
story has too little say in whether it should be covered and how it should be covered and a 
of how our organizations have changed news organizations have changed as profit became accessible as they became extremely profitable 
as that became the priority sc i imagine the profit was always the priority but is it more i 
worry about doing comparisons between things today and things back in the past we see things through rosecolored glasses 
so how i see it and people will disagree when news first came along at the network level it 
a loss leader it was part of the agreement to be able to use the airwaves and so there 
not pressure for them to monetize and then the way i understand it when sixty minutes came along and 
made money it was the first time network executives realized can make a profit off of and so then 
got the morning shows which are more entertainment they started making a lot of money but the news was 
sacrosanct evening news jy cable changed things because they regulated by the the same fcc equal time rules apply 
then for me partly about the fact that all of these companies were bought by publicly traded corporations sc 
jy where it was important to show profit growth over last year to the shareholders all the time and 
really became a that shortterm thinking impacted the news room to the point that i was told it is 
job to increase our profit over last year sc and giving guidance to what that meant or just do 
that will get more eyeballs jy the way i took it was comply sc yeah okay comply with explicit 
jy well what happens is i think when a reporter a natural skeptic you question authority and a little 
right to work in a news organization you be very rebellious because a a bureaucratic system you have to 
obedient but you have that streak in you and what happened increasingly is that management would tell us what 
story is and say back and they would say you not hear me telling you this is the now 
making up facts not a fake news thing pointing to a is how decided is best to frame it 
our programming needs aka eyeballs aka ratings and the story you need to sc and so sort of flesh 
out maybe i know if you have examples or when did you start noticing those feelings by when did 
start being a national reporter jy well okay so i got to the white house under bush and i 
take it back further than that when i was when i first got to the national level it was 
iraq war sc okay jy and you remember with the way sc sorry the second iraq war jy yeah 
the second iraq war and you remember the way i got in trouble eventually because i later said on 
that we were under pressure to cover it in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fever in 
nation sc yeah it was a different time every time is different but i think that you forget given 
highly inflamed political feelings everyone has right now it was pretty darn inflamed back in the early jy well 
was right after everybody felt the sense of connectedness and nationalism really and patriotism and then we went to 
and it was sort of gonna stand up for and so everything was channeled into this sort of intense 
event show of force remember it was called the shock and awe campaign right sc yeah jy and what 
did was consistent with that and so my experience even from a remove i was not at war i 
a junior baby reporter then but i just watched what happened and there was a decision like the narrative 
is here kicking ass the and things that in that vein really prioritized cut it sc and i remember 
was controversy at the time about how reporters were embedded with military units jy well the way we do 
now yeah and but it was very much like a tv show there were vans with reporters on them 
cameras as they marched driving to baghdad with the troops it was a show and that kind of opened 
eyes to producing the sc right chuckle jy this is not just happening air drop in and cover it 
march in together with the cameras rolling and gonna kick some and then it and then i got to 
white house after that under bush and saw that as the war was popular with the american people we 
it in a way that was as the poll numbers started to fall we began increasingly critical sc did 
personally go to journalism school or anything like that jy i did not sc i presume that in journalism 
but maybe even in your tenure as a cub reporter the myth the selfconception is that there is an 
relationship between reporters and people they cover even if a friendly adversarial relationship not there to give them publicity 
to dig out the truth that they might be trying to hide from you so you think that at 
at this time in the cable news world this was not being respected jy well it is hard when 
a war zone because dependent on the military imagine for your own security so a tricky relationship much easier 
back at the white house to be adversarial sc did you spend time in iraq or elsewhere jy i 
go for the wars sc but they are like you said there was definitely pretty explicitly an attempt to 
manage what was seen and so i guess what saying which was not clear to me at the time 
that that was a profitmaking thing from the point of view of the networks they went along with that 
for those reasons jy well they crafted it in a way that would be popular with viewers sc yeah 
so that get more eyeballs is the way i see it it they talk about news as programming which 
you live in la you know how tv executives talk about their tv slate making a program people want 
watch as opposed to are journalists covering events as they happen and we cover what matters and that you 
a judgement about is what matters most and it might be less sexy than the thing we were planning 
gonna cover it anyway because important and our sc and not necessarily a political thing saying that this was 
the thing was popular and then it changed jy like more boring than tweets so syria gets less coverage 
yeah jy even though potentially on certain days it might be more significant sc so one of my questions 
is the opinion of the corporate executives that a certain thing is gonna be popular and make us money 
they correct or just their gut feeling or do they have data saying certain kinds of coverage gets us 
profits we jy so they do have the analytics so they have a framework and within their framework of 
works with viewers they have all these analytics and measurement metrics to decide gonna be popular so boards in 
newsroom showing on dot com doing well and see one story start to rise in clicks right and so 
becomes the top story and so more people are then assigned to cover that top story because getting more 
sc okay jy also eyeball meters so that people can now executives can now tell as viewers are turning 
channel so they were watching for that topic but turning for this topic go back to that that kind 
thing now the flaw in this from my point of view is that this is all based on their 
which is news needs to be told like sports viewers want news that feels like espn so it has 
be all that conflict jargon competition and outrage and they program everything through that filter i can get into 
it got to be that way but the bottom line is i know for a fact because done the 
it that leaves a huge audience unaddressed because so many people feel alienated by that sportslike coverage they just 
it off and so already limited their audience to the people who want news that feels like sports and 
within them their metrics and their analytics can measure how many getting but i believe that a massive unaddressed 
out there and just missing the opportunity sc i even are alienated by that in the context of sports 
shows on espn where two people shouting at each other like tell me nothing about jy bingo sc so 
did it get that way you said you have your own theory so lay it on us jy so 
theory when all these news executives who are running the networks now came up everything was about the ad 
it really subscriptions and the people who paid the most for an eyeball were the car dealers and car 
wanted a young man sc sorry when do you think talking now jy late early sc okay jy and 
dealers wanted the young man right they thought he makes the car purchase decision and he owns the your 
for life ps now found untrue women make the car purchase decision and this generation buying cars the future 
carless or uber anyway so flawed assumption now but the idea is that man that interested in the news 
he he wants conflict if you tell it like conflict feel more engaging and so everything you do when 
the news business i would always constantly hear did we do with the and the demo men ages eighteen 
sc the demographic yeah jy yeah the demographic the demographic refers to people ages eighteen to but the most 
eyeball is the guy because the hardest to get i joke news is run by the rules of dysfunctional 
you have to chase the guy who want you chuckle sc right right but i would like to think 
in so let me be idealistic we have a big elaborate ecosystem of news many different ways people can 
the news now has any one of the major cable networks said everyone else is doing that try something 
jy i would disagree that within the traditional news field we have that many choices much more like the 
studio system three networks and three cable channels six outlets for tv news right sc so not that many 
not that many and they all compete with each other and they play by the same rules the exception 
cbs which has tried to differentiate itself by being calmer more substantive less fast switch and been rewarded for 
but i do i think the other piece of this which is worth noting in our moment is the 
of everybody a news president until recently has been the same all mostly all white guys in their who 
up in upper westside of new york and they have the same values and the same backgrounds they all 
to the same schools sc went to ivy league schools yeah jy right and this is what they think 
sc right and they can convince themselves that is perfectly objective and scientific right chuckle jy well making money 
their companies sc right right so we mentioned i mean we painted this in the context of the second 
war is the same story told in different ways just in more conventional political coverage conventions and races and 
yeah i so my take on the way this is expressed is first of all yes political coverage the 
with it is all horse race literally up this down what are the poll and i think this is 
our democracy nothing short of that because it is the job to inform the public and we are failing 
do that by constantly covering this game without telling people does this hit you at and be more specific 
if you watch the news you know that at the end of the election all about the undecided voter 
spend four months chasing these people and when you get into the granular stuff you find a lot of 
undecided voters are women and the conventional wisdom is not paying attention so they decide late and they often 
what their husbands say jy but if you probe them more closely what they say is no reading things 
the news it speak to and when i looked more closely at that i did research what literally saying 
this candidate wins how will it change my life if that candidate wins how will that change my not 
it down in a way that connects on a level personal and part of that is also not explaining 
the thing is so we talk about tax reform without saying it specifically means this or we talk about 
wars without ever saying what a tariff is not everybody knows just take a minute to explain sc and 
that why is that why do we not take a minute to explain jy well i always tried to 
people were like no one wants to hear considered boring and not a game if there explaining what a 
is not in a fight not conflict you could lose one of those demo eyeballs sc i still i 
this feeling and maybe just completely biased but if there were a concerted effort even on one of these 
news outlets on tv to give people good explanations of what was going on to explicitly pander to people 
wanted to understand rather than just follow the horse race that would be a big hit maybe crazy jy 
i love you for saying that because the business launching which is news focused on the understanding and we 
talk about that in a bit but i not what in the business of doing sc yeah jy part 
the other piece of this is when in political journalism in washington you get consumed with breaking the thing 
a lot of reporting for each other right so in the bubble and really talking to your sources on 
hill while on tv or talking to your sources in the white house and showing off your colleagues who 
got to give you a scoop and so so in circle it leaves the viewer out and part of 
so part of the reason not explaining is because moving too fast to impress each other sc so take 
from the angles of different people who are in the game right now so if you were giving advice 
a young person who had just been appointed senior white house correspondent like how would you want them to 
to try to make things better jy well i mean in the sc where we are in idealovision now 
okay sc in the happiest timeline jy okay i love that you have a vibrant editorial debate in the 
with the smart people you work with because these networks are filled with unbelievably talented journalists decide what you 
the three most important stories are and start asking questions about those and ignore trending on dot com right 
this minute because the chief white house correspondent and if you decide this is a big story you can 
that story trend sc right jy we follow too much we forget the power we have you are the 
you say what matters too much of this we gotta go along with what the conversation and not enough 
the and then when you the thing i try to do when i approach each story is think about 
assumptions making here what assumptions am i making about what the audience understands and even to the lingo using 
we talk about michael going to testify but when he goes before congress everything he says related to russia 
be in closed session so still get the transcripts and know most people know what closed session is sc 
jy so you lost them sc yeah jy take a minute and i know that seem revolutionary but it 
because when you start to do that you pick up people who feel left out by the news and 
start to engage and care and literally how you inform the electorate in a democracy sc and you know 
saying is very much like science communication right where you have so much jargon so the people who are 
are very often used to talking in a certain way taking certain things for granted and then they are 
as to why people are not more excited by what saying jy and how do you unpack that how 
you reverse that sc i think that yeah we do it in a lot of different ways different people 
different strategies very often simply a matter of talking to people to figure out what it is they understand 
one is born understanding physics you learn it but then once you learn it very easy to forget what 
knew or what you know back in the day right so talking to people just seeing what you understand 
try to explain using analogies with things trying to relate to things that familiar with in their everyday lives 
jy but i imagine this is similar in science there must be a group of scientists who care like 
know what talking about not in the circle not speaking to sc yeah called almost all scientists yes right 
and how i think political coverage is now like either in the game like a sports fan meaning politics 
or not and if not not gonna get you we know that my belief is not true sc right 
so if you were then rather than giving advice to the cub reporter if you were giving advice or 
were granted the position of boss of a network how would you change things jy about thinking all the 
about how does this impact this viewer at home how do i make this relevant to their life what 
the piece of this that matters to their life and how do i get outside of the studio and 
of washington one of the worst things happened in coverage lately is always in the studio the job is 
leave the studio the news is out there sc is it a money thing is it just cost cutting 
to sit in washington dc than go out into the world jy i think reasons one through three are 
way cheaper to have people on set than to send a satellite truck a producer a cameraman a sound 
and a reporter five people who overnighting and paying their per diems and etcetera so one piece the other 
news executives increasingly like to produce the news saying right and if just deployed me to the border but 
some big russia thing breaks stuck paying for me at the border but you wanna change topics and so 
in studio they can rapidly decide they can control the story much more effectively and they can also get 
the ear and tell them no stay on russia stay on sc yeah what is your take on the 
wanna say the fox news phenomenon but very broadly construed the idea of media outlets that are more or 
explicitly partisan one way or the other jy so gonna probably piss off a lot of your listeners by 
this sc go for it jy but i kind of think our future dividing into red and blue as 
not just in news when you look at how people spend and shop and live clustering into communities of 
people we are shopping in the same ways based on your politics not surprised that this is happening and 
little bit like napster you put it back in the box there important is to now be transparent i 
like these networks to be a little more transparent is where coming sc so what does that mean oh 
in terms of their political slant so rather than just fair and jy right while obviously having a point 
view sc yeah jy be a little more clear and facts negotiable whatever your point of view i think 
to say are the facts of the shut if a democrat make the case that the shut down is 
stalemate for this reason if a republican make the case that at stalemate for this reason so showing the 
but the facts of the shut down remain the same sc but the number of facts that one could 
principle talk about is infinitely large jy true sc i mean a big part of the filter of the 
if you wanna call it that whether not necessarily pejorative term but we choose what to talk about and 
thing that networks can control a little jy absolutely and i also think nothing wrong with that you become 
journalist because saying the one we trust to help decide what talking about and what bothers me is when 
say we have to cover this we have a or gotta give both sides we have a choice of 
change and anti with equal right and no there because we asked you to do the research and tell 
what you think is true sc yeah there was this video not video but there was this little picture 
around the internet recently cnn had a i know the details whether it was a news segment or an 
segment but they were saying giving a voice to climate change and they had a picture of various people 
climate change but two out the four pictures were from cnn like done that what it is definitely mixed 
there jy well also this false balance we have this point of view so we have to have that 
of view sc right jy and that sometimes is what makes me nuts like on climate change you can 
climate change is happening this is the aggressive version of addressing it a conservative version of addressing it you 
have a conversation within the space of fact sc right jy and at some point yes fox is going 
marshal different facts on a topic than msnbc also the job of the consumer to be a little news 
sc well a very interesting point a big believer again also with science that you have to ask something 
the audience like they have to be a little bit aware of going on it has to be a 
and take right jy absolutely just a critical thinking skill and our job to help train people maybe some 
now now on instagram and so i get a lot of feedback from the audience and i do a 
of that where they know who to believe i believe this in the new york times they hate like 
the new york times has a frame right now yes you could tell a little shrill but when you 
a reported story with an investigative reporter i know this guy yeah go with sc you can believe it 
do you foresee in the future as there are more and more ways for people to get their news 
more of them are just getting it from facebook and twitter that even that goes away no such thing 
reported news just what your friends shared with you on facebook jy i believe that the future is i 
news organizations are like the old studio system where you had actors married for life to a studio and 
had to do their movie with that studio but if a movie happened somewhere else they be in it 
it is now got to pitch your story to your network if they want it done i think the 
is all of that is gonna people will leave and be seeing individual reporters on facebook and instagram and 
these spaces and whatever emerges in new media platforms and people will start to follow the individuals they trust 
interesting jy and i think it is a mistake to assume that because getting your news on social people 
credible journalism so i think a place for credible journalists reporting their wellsourced wellresearched information on social media in 
channels outside the network system sc in my more pessimistic moments i see people on either political side clearly 
something just they wanna believe it regardless of the credibility of the source jy well there neuro science on 
sc oh yes jy and why right you could probably tell me sc a tough one yeah people have 
sorts of cognitive biases but one of the things that is for better or for worse about the proliferation 
places to get your news is you can sort of give in to your worst impulses there you can 
hear from sources that are gonna tell you what you wanna believe jy yeah sorting into our likeminded communities 
yeah jy and i know the way out necessarily i think one way out is to have trusted voices 
you get a large following behind like the walter cronkite effect never exist again with that size of a 
but have individuals who are trusted voices in different spaces sc but one of the things we see on 
news for example as well as on the other cable networks is this back and forth on the channel 
straight news and opinion or commentary and my feeling is that on fox a vast majority of the audience 
from the opinion commentary shows so that just gives them more and more incentive to be more and more 
in some sense jy yeah well my perception was a lot of the fox we all worked together at 
white house they were my friends they were my colleagues the reporters were always kickass sc yeah jy the 
comes in the night it was especially the prime time shows but as you get later in the afternoon 
hard as a viewer to make that distinction and you were very smart to make it but the reporters 
reporting information sourced researched information they sometimes have to report into anchors who are untethered from those things chuckle 
and is there room for something maybe cnn to have a balance of that news plus opinion but keep 
opinion balanced just not try to be the mouthpiece of one side or the other like the new york 
tries to do with its oped pages although of course still a slant there jy i know the problem 
on cnn for example in the effort to be balanced they often book trump supporters who had no experience 
politics before this moment and say things that just productive not part of the conversation right so how do 
get around that how do you do that in an intelligent way where you have a balance that necessarily 
the politics of the administration sc right but we can imagine in the happiest timeline in our idealovision here 
some day we have trump anymore maybe have just very respectable legitimate parties on both sides my question is 
it be such a splintering that every outlet picks a side or do you think that you can still 
outlets trying to stay above that political drive jy oh i think have outlets that are trying i call 
reporting straight news and yes i think absolutely have that and i think you know after this moment where 
the corrective will people will be very sober very substantive possibly who knows right but we a pendulum sc 
jy and so yes i can imagine that go to a place where neutral reporting will be valued sc 
there will always be this interest in having opinionated voices my question is do opinionated voices stick together or 
we imagine i remember in the early days of fox news hannity was on with alan colmes right they 
least gave some nod to yes have one person from each that work jy i just think happened now 
that the opinionated voices have become so extreme no conversation anymore just talking points being flung back and forth 
why you never get learning so my ideal somebody told me that in the netherlands when you testify before 
court when two experts come they do something called the maybe one of your listeners knows about this sc 
know this one yeah jy can teach us a little more sure gonna mingle it but that the experts 
are on the opposing sides begin by submitting a document that shows their area of consensus this is where 
overlap these are the topics on which we agree sc well nice jy how we see similarly sc yeah 
and then you testify to the differences and i love that idea so that at some point you establish 
ground and then you discuss around that i think that would be a fascinating way to do these conversations 
option i like how they do it in britain where you have two talking heads yelling at each other 
bring one person on and go very deep with them and then you can go on the other side 
deep but you actually then get to as saying the theory of the thing sc right jy and happening 
is like shoutovision sc well and also they there are people who are the ones who appear on tv 
are just obviously their job is to present the advocacy case for one side or the other and their 
in sticking to the truth might come or go but rather than having an expert who might have an 
one side or the other but nevertheless wants to get it right just fighting for their team jy oh 
but by design so when i was on the inside find this expert see a ted talk or whatever 
say so smart they know their stuff and they speak clearly get them and the response would be they 
the sc yeah jy and so we literally cast for people who will yell at each other hold their 
about that not incidental what the show is sc so this needs to change gonna change it right jy 
goal sc so you left your job i guess as chief white house correspondent intentionally and so trying to 
a new project to bring people news in a different way tell us about that jy the project is 
called it newsnotnoise we wanna bring you news and tell you the noise and on instagram so first of 
you can find it on instagram under my name which is jessica yellin and i am reporting the news 
and what and it sort of started to take off which is exciting sc yeah jy but what happened 
i left i wrote a novel about like it like to be a woman in the news business the 
and then i did research into what talking about how is the news impacting viewers and i looked at 
specifically called people who want information seek it out and then turn it off or want information and seek 
out avoiding the news for a reason even though they want it and what i found is that it 
triggering so much anxiety in a part of the population they just engage heavily female but not exclusively and 
that they care about the news and not that bad news is scary and they must avoid it the 
and the negativity and that yelling sc the shouting yeah jy the shouting makes them have enough going on 
and a boss and my broken sc yeah jy so how do you reach that audience and i was 
and so i did the research and in fact yeah this audience and they want the news told differently 
all the conventional wisdom is gonna watch sc shouting why would i watch jy this is precisely why they 
the shouting to get ratings so i went on instagram because i figured this is a place i can 
out another way sc an interesting choice a little bit on instagram but i think of it as a 
to share pictures of my food jy i did it a couple of reasons there one it have that 
patina of like there a fake news here unsullied two very female and i knew that like the first 
for this thing is female and a nice place people nasty to each other on instagram as much as 
are on the other platforms and i just thought least they be mean to laughter sc or maybe to 
other or maybe not seeking meanness yeah jy exactly sc yeah jy and nobody was really doing the news 
i mean you just have that sc yeah jy so i started off and i do a post like 
explainer where i break down a topic in the news basically what is a tariff or people are comparing 
testimony to john dean john dean what did he do many people know or even every person in the 
investigation what are their piece of this and then a section video and i do a video newscast in 
and and i started it because i wanted to see people pay attention if the news hysterical panicky and 
i just wanted to see what the reaction was anyway i started doing sc when you say you mean 
just you right jy yeah i mean it it was so hard at the beginning i was the chief 
house correspondent i had a cameraman i had and then there i am sitting in my living room with 
iphone alone thinking i really gonna do sc yeah jy what if people laugh what if nobody cares what 
awful what if a million things so that was really hard sc are your video segments short long jy 
so this is the thing about instagram every video has to be fifteen seconds so what i do is 
break a newscast down i say every piece of it in fifteen seconds so there is big news in 
russia investigation a bombshell new york times report not gonna next fifteen seconds overlapping conversation jy yes and so 
advance through those fifteen second things sc and instagram lets you have multiple things on one post so all 
one post jy yeah so this thing called stories on one part of it sc oh yeah jy up 
top and you can watch video and usually used sc i went to hawaii jy i went to hawaii 
at my new bathing suit my dog usually shallow fluffy stuff but this is me talking to camera or 
an article that i think is important and summarize it and give you a link so you can swipe 
and read it and then sometimes i do interviews about a topic in the news and people come up 
we do the twoway sc so what is the archiving like is it easy to find old things that 
explaining all these wonderful things maybe still wanna know what a tariff is next year jy so yeah so 
part like those explainers i was saying they stay forever and i even know what you in the thing 
the instagram called the gallery or the feed sc okay jy so if you go to my page see 
these pictures and if you tap look at each of those pictures a caption with them that explains the 
so they stay forever then the video piece and those last twentyfour hours sc okay so like the buddhist 
gone to the wind twentyfour hours later jy i try to remember to save them to this one highlight 
so people can go back and watch but i always remember sc kind of charming though the news current 
then jy and then is gone sc which different than an explainer which should hopefully be good for a 
time jy exactly and the most satisfying thing is when you do an explainer that you can keep reusing 
to this story remember if you missed it here it like what is a national emergency as talking about 
wall right sc right yeah no i think that the whole idea of explaining things is way undervalued in 
news media ecosystem entirely so more of that would be great jy people wanna know sc yeah yeah and 
instagram jy so yeah the fun so i know how celebritysavvy everybody but amy schumer the comedian became an 
follower sc okay jy and she decided to announce her pregnancy on my instagram feed sc alright jy she 
she did this political thing around the election and said okay so when she did that all of a 
the world exploded because you know what a celebrity announces their pregnancy like the biggest news in the world 
not saying it how it should be sc i get it we get it jy anyway so then all 
a sudden everybody noticed i was doing this and really a following for it and the most interesting and 
part to me is that the audience is really engaged so i have people who ask questions and then 
people in the community answer them and you can see this dialogue going on and then i also have 
different kind of connection to the audience so do a story and people will instantly message me saying know 
that so then i know i have to break that down sc that goes back to my idea of 
scientists can be better communicators just asking people what it is they understand jy exactly sc very important jy 
you have that feedback when on television so really gratifying sc and so this race is a question of 
very wise person once said read the to anything about anything and largely kind of a shame because sometimes 
on the internet are wonderful and learned a lot from people but many of them are pointless or toxic 
whatever so is it because of instagram or because of your feed or how engaged are you in those 
sections jy pretty engaged sometimes too much and i busy but i do my best so far knock on 
people have been very nice yes you get the occasional screed but surprised how completely open and sort of 
newssponges so one of the so i say news not noise and the way i cover things is i 
is and then say another story that got a ton of attention today in the news business but sc 
jy gonna tell you what happened but you have to pay attention to it if it interests you follow 
just like follow us magazine people but it so noise so people are constantly messaging back and forth like 
noise i found news is this noise or cool and the kind of stuff you get in comments not 
mean stuff you get on twitter a much nicer experience sc it seems maybe this is a disadvantage so 
me if wrong but it seems that so different from the other stuff on instagram that if i have 
instagram feed yours will stand out for better or for worse than everything else jy i do i think 
of it really tried it this way before and so distinctive for now sure change because everything changes sc 
your plan is to grow this jy so my goal is now that seen that people really want it 
find a way to do more very hard to do a full news cast and really answer questions on 
as it is right now i also wanna bring other reporters in and so the question is how do 
that how do you grow it the next step sc but the goal is to be a substitute for 
biggest news source whatever that is the new york times or cnn or whatever fill that niche jy some 
where like to go sc yeah jy i think of it as at least at this stage like look 
four years could there be a day when doing investigative reporting and breaking the stories ourselves or sooner yes 
amazing for right now what trying to do is say a super busy person and you do not have 
to follow every twist and turn of going on all day long and those notifications on your phone are 
you crazy we gotcha so come to us at the end of the day gonna distill it all in 
way that make you feel stupid but really explains it tells you what happened what mattered what you can 
and a reason to still feel good about the world sc and is there still a race to be 
quick when something breaks jy so no and so hard for me such a smart question sean oh my 
you so get it so one of the things the ethos is is more important to process and distill 
thing and then make it as succinct as possible for the viewer and that means letting the story unfold 
it breathe let it happen in the world a little bit before you do it but my muscle memory 
to the camera get it on now i got it so i have everyone around me is like jessica 
report stop put your phone sc i kind of know exactly what you mean because for a long time 
for a little while anyway my biggest social media presence was on twitter but now i have a podcast 
on twitter you say something and most of the responses are within half an hour right people are responding 
you right away jy really yeah true right away sc now i have a podcast it takes an hour 
a half just to listen to it very disappointed when half an hour after posting it i had any 
yet jy right so quickly trained for that instant feedback sc this part of our brain i know what 
is but yeah instant right away jy well there is this thing evolving calling it the news which is 
what talking about not reacting too rapidly and also reporting stories over a longer time so more indepth sc 
good because a i never really liked the phrase long reads i know if you know this word because 
gives the idea that we should read things that are more than five hundred words and really go into 
and get it but great but we can also be correct in short amounts of words a whole different 
a different axis that trying to focus on jy and what trying to do and ps very hard to 
understand a complex situation and then break it down in a very short way that is accurate and clear 
a challenge sc i did this very explicitly with my last book the big picture so a big sprawling 
where i covered all sorts of things and some of the topics were pretty heavy so every chapter was 
three or four pages long right and there were fifty chapters so you could just focus on getting that 
little bit process it and then move on jy hard sc it is very hard jy a discipline sc 
not doing it in my current book chuckle jy how long is your current book sc a much a 
book but only ten chapters rather than fifty chapters a all the different modes are okay the new book 
mode is gonna dive in here gonna wallow in the details gonna accumulate this knowledge and hopefully it will 
me come out the other end with something really rather than is a survey of many many jy the 
book about sc the new book is about quantum mechanics especially the many interpretation of quantum mechanics and you 
have to sort of steel yourself and try to get into the weeds a little bit whereas the big 
a lot of deep stuff in there but it was a lot more signposting a lot more me more 
but this is a jy so when you and the expert in the field is it still hard to 
a book when i wrote my first book i was like halfway through like out in the middle of 
i know what gonna sc i think a great question different for different people i know plenty of professional 
who hate writing books they love writing a few thousand word article or whatever but with a book they 
get lost i love it jy you do sc never happier than when i have words in front of 
like to do things my way i get to explain and the current supposed to be like or words 
i feel very constrained jy wow i admire that sc but so and so going well so far jy 
sc is there going to be at some point like a separate web page where people can find it 
yes what thinking about now is how do you turn this into something more of a news brand and 
does that look like where does it live how does that work and so having those conversations and a 
new world and learning curve for me sc and i have to ask how do you make money chuckle 
do you keep the wheels jy this is the sc how do you keep the lights on right jy 
you really on instagram sc no ads or anything jy not really i guess you can get sponsorships but 
feel i know sc do you have a patreon or something like that or people overlapping conversation jy yeah 
done that maybe the direction looking at these options is it patreon is it finding a backer who will 
something so you really stretch your wings and try but again the goal is to do this in a 
that has integrity and is about the things talked about focusing on understanding the audience and so you just 
get in the situation where again just like servicing how many eyeballs can you get sc right beholden yeah 
that same machine sc yeah i made that decision so far for the podcast where i have ads i 
make more money if i had ads but a little bit less fun to have the ads some good 
out there but i care what mattress you sleep on honestly i know why the mattress companies love advertising 
podcasts so asking people to support through patreon or through paypal or whatever so great jy and they do 
show up and they do it sc they do yeah mostly grateful like people are willing if someone gives 
a dollar per episode i think that if an hour and a half of talking getting a worth out 
it jy sure you can get it sc but i still feel extraordinarily grateful when they do yeah great 
nice yeah sc but doing something a little bit different i talked on one podcast episode with neha narula 
expert in crypto currency blockchain and things like that and i said we really need is just a nonoptional 
can listen to this but you pay a jy right sc right and most people would do that jy 
so agree sc but the technology quite there yet jy really sc not yet i jy how long sc 
could be very soon but the whole cryptocurrency thing is just in so much turmoil right jy yeah sc 
think actually that technologically it could happen but the buyin is not quite there yet jy well you know 
numbers show people are more and more willing to pay for their content and subscriptions are way up sc 
jy and so i think an increasing consciousness that you gotta support these sources sc yeah jy or go 
or you end up with your uncle fred giving you the news on facebook sc well one of those 
who subscribes to a couple of real newspapers and magazines just i wanna support journalism jy would they show 
as paper forms in your house sc no i get paper forms jy okay chuckle sc in fact i 
nothing jy i got it sc things i could get on the internet for jy but you pay sc 
new york times or whatever but willing to pay the twenty bucks or whatever jy good for you yeah 
you sc it does matter and the world is getting more complicated not gonna get any simpler and getting 
news reporting matters right jy yes sc yeah but not all doing not only are you reporting the news 
trying to start a whole not only a new particular news operation but a new way of doing the 
jy yes sc but you have a novel coming out right jy yes oh my gosh sc what made 
decide to do that too much free time you just needed jy how did you know sc fill the 
somehow jy i wanted to do something that would make me feel like i was very bad at my 
chuckle jy so always wanted to write a novel i loved trashy novels when i was a kid and 
wanted to write them when i grew up and then i ended up being a journalist instead and so 
when i was leaving it was really important for me so i left before trump but i saw what 
happening in the industry and i thought really want people to understand what goes into the making of the 
and what like every and two ways to do that to write a tellall where you rip people and 
people and i just wanna be part of that sc yeah jy but i still wanted the story to 
told so i wrote it as a novel and called savage news and about a young female reporter named 
savage and she basically has always wanted to be white house correspondent and gets to a cable news channel 
they put her at the white house just as the first lady disappears and she has to chase the 
of the missing first lady but she realizes along the way something else much more serious is happening and 
network let her report the more serious story it rate and there are all these other components competing with 
man and in a contest to get the white house job sc yeah okay good jy so lots of 
sc was it fun did you have fun writing the book jy in the end i had such a 
and funny so that was a fun part and being able to tell the stories was so fun but 
turns out like a whole craft to writing a novel you just write your story laughter sc i think 
at all i think you can just think it and it appears jy right sc well no what i 
gonna ask characterization how much you describe and things like that was there a lot of give and take 
editors and readers and so forth jy well the new way you do a novel is you hire an 
as doing it you send the editor the pages to give you feedback so in conversation with somebody who 
the space sc okay jy and so i was constantly in conversation and one of the challenges has always 
to tell people like this seems larger than and like no that literally happened every chuckle sc yeah jy 
call my reporter friends and like not gonna believe this stuff they think and like no it happened to 
a minute sc can you give us one little example jy yeah give you example she is fighting fighting 
to prove herself at the white house and she finally nails this one scoop and she runs and tells 
boss the scoops that she can get on air and like to the and by the time she gets 
the camera she goes up live just as she watches her male competition report that scoop she got and 
the boss gave it to the guy and my friends were like people outside the news business think that 
never sc cartoonishly evil yeah jy right happens all day every day sc yeah alright so gonna learn a 
have some laughs but learn a lot and what was the novel called again jy savage savage news savage 
sc so something come out in all of these different aspects the cnn the instagram the novel is that 
worth talking to women as well as men i mean this is clearly something that we always do in 
society how important is that to you jy a big part of this yeah we gotten to that i 
part of the book is about reporting while female and i get gruesome but sexual harassment in the book 
and in the process of writing the book so many people told me to take that out wants to 
about seems sc men or women told you that jy both and then the harvey weinstein thing happened and 
calls me up and like it back in put it back laughter jy so in a way writing the 
was a parallel of the experience which is not allowed to talk about this stuff and one of my 
is that we do need much more diversity not just women but diversity in general at the highest levels 
these companies because who decides what counts as news is completely limited by your own experience and so if 
black woman who comes from ohio what you think counts as news is gonna be pretty different from somebody 
the upper west side of new york and we have enough of that and so yeah i think really 
that you have women in decisionmaking roles and cbs just named their first female news president sc oh i 
that who is it jy her susan zirinsky oh and a little trivia factoid she was the model for 
holly hunter character on broadcast news sc oh okay a good starting point right there jy and legend in 
news business and a badass sc i do think that this feeling in some quarters that good to be 
to men and women and white people and black people and whatever but anyone can do and a countervailing 
like no as wellintentioned as you are something about living the experience that gives you a perspective that you 
otherwise jy well just tell you this the research shows that when you have a woman running a newsroom 
a man running a newsroom the way the coverage is done is very different the way the coverage is 
when a running it is much more you have many more humans in the story saying impacted me this 
a i mean cliche to say more empathic but there is more of an empathy in it much more 
to the human level and when the guys are doing it much more theoretical the game the fight and 
is my thesis on why they say women like political and foreign coverage less because we take the time 
connect it to the you and if you bring it back to the human level the female audience will 
more sc the technical term for this in philosophy would be standpoint epistemology talking about this on another podcast 
yeah epistemology is the way that we learn things the way that we know things the way that we 
what we know and guess what people coming from different perspectives of the world do that differently even if 
same truth not a matter of being relativistic about what is right and what is wrong but we pick 
certain things as important or roots to getting there depending on where we come from jy and gender would 
be a factor in filtering that sc hugely important yeah so you mentioned the fact that one of your 
toward instagram was the fact that a lot of women on instagram and never thought about it that way 
twitter more than anything else a little bit of blogging and the podcast and everything and being a scientist 
from where i come from a large majority of my audience is men not women i would love it 
there were a larger fraction of women there jy get you women sc maybe i should jy bring from 
sc yeah maybe i should be on instagram more i use instagram just for the silliest most trivial reasons 
of my cats and food and things like that chuckle jy allowed sc and yeah allowed to but maybe 
many many ways certainly in science we could do a better job at reaching audiences that we i was 
science consultant on the original four movie jy ooh sc not a lotta science in that movie but a 
of the motivation was that natalie portman played a role of physicist and you almost notice while watching the 
but at least we had hopes that gonna be some young girl who would see that and sort of 
with that and that movie will reach a lot more people than i ever will with all the books 
ever do or all the podcasts i ever record jy well representation makes a huge difference just having it 
a different form matters sc yeah yeah jy and i certainly one been talking about this business doing and 
i pitch it and say that the first audience is female i get a lot of pushback from men 
are like hate the news too why you trying to reach like no no i am for you sc 
they realize the irony in that the last five hundred years or whatever has been the other side and 
complaining laughter jy no i try sc but the just because maybe people listening know you would never know 
seeing your instagram feed that there was anything especially female about it doing the same topics that everyone else 
jy right and that is a challenge is that people think doing girls news or no no no doing 
news sc baking tips chuckle jy right or style or fashion or home no no no there the latest 
yemen this is hard stuff just trying i guess the better way to say it is i try to 
of the stories and bring feminine values into the way i make sense of it i am so hardwired 
be the other way i know how to cover news as sports a color commentator whatever you call the 
how do you bring another point of view into it and so what trying to do sc but this 
you credibility right only nixon can go to china done the work in playing that game that way right 
yes sc so just to close up what tell the future a little bit are you more or less 
about the future of news and how we get it people debate about the effects of the internet and 
media and fragmentation clearly both good aspects and bad aspects how should we bet jy well i have to 
my experience has been so rewarding that optimistic because i get so much feedback from the audience that says 
watching the news thank you for giving me news without a panic or taken the toxicity out of the 
i can watch you before bed and feel calm and i can and so instructive not because giving me 
but because they want the information and one of the things i was constantly told is checked out they 
they wanna and as long as you have an audience that wants to know we will find ways to 
it and it turns out that by telling it with integrity and discipline and empathy you get an audience 
i think that in having success in this space it will encourage other people to try this as well 
yeah i think for one thing a great accomplishment because the stories bringing them are not intrinsically calming jy 
true and sometimes i feel bad because like my laughter sc right but what pointing out is that this 
espn talking heads motif makes it even worse it aggravates it jy yes and there is a piece of 
that still trying to crack which is people want solutions and not are we gonna solve the government shutdown 
tell you the story of the government shutdown which have a resolution but a story about a company rescuing 
out of the ocean and had enormous as long as reminding people that over the course of history found 
to solve the hard problems it gives them the optimism to feel this too can be solved sc so 
come down on your side being a little optimistic here i know that whether doing this podcast or giving 
about science or being on tv talking about the multiverse always positively encouraged when people stretch out to sort 
learn these hard new things and respond to them and i think that we condescend a little bit to 
audiences and when we refuse to do that rewarded jy absolutely they just know explain the basics and with 
and really exciting is people respond to that like sponges they wanna know sc good well i hope we 
push a couple more subscribers your way through this podcast jy yay i love it sc and helping making 
a little bit more optimistic about the news jy sean such an honor to be on with you really 
is a pleasure thank you sc jessica thanks so much for being on the podcast jy thank you music 
to keep going on about audio file tags up until episode the album name tag was then it shifted 
nice and short my preferred tag as of this latest episode it seems to have shifted yet again to 
science society philosophy culture arts and i have edited it on my device to mindscape podcast so the audio 
ends up in the same album folder as past episodes but i kinda like not to have to do 
harped about lousy newscasts forever especially about how basic elements of stories defined so i can understand and one 
those people who quit watching the news over such frustrations though hungry for news yay jessica yellin matt taibbi 
did a recent series on the weird dynamics and bad incentives of big journalism i think it was called 
really news at that point just dudes hollering who watches that they need to come up with a ezpass 
web content and all major content providers should sign on for its use i love the way she approaches 
news on her instagram page however i have to wonder if the positivity and helpfulness in her comment section 
related to the small community it seems like everything that gets popular turns into a cesspool so that leaves 
in a i tell my friends about her instagram page or not comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations 
the worlds most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts and ideas
