layer is that there was no learning algorithm that could go from the outputs and look at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made
is that there was no learning algorithm that could go from the outputs and look at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the
that there was no learning algorithm that could go from the outputs and look at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the whole
there was no learning algorithm that could go from the outputs and look at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the whole system
was no learning algorithm that could go from the outputs and look at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the whole system much
no learning algorithm that could go from the outputs and look at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the whole system much more

look at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the whole system much more complicated and nobody had an algorithm for learning sc so
at the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the whole system much more complicated and nobody had an algorithm for learning sc so the
the errors made at the outputs and apportion credit for or blame for those errors back through a hidden layer to the input sc through the different neurons yeah mm yeah so it made the whole system much more complicated and nobody had an algorithm for learning sc so the perceptron

know that and not clear that it could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one
that and not clear that it could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example
and not clear that it could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was
not clear that it could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in
clear that it could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in addition
that it could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in addition to
it could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in addition to alphago
could learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in addition to alphago the
learn that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in addition to alphago the google
that sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in addition to alphago the google deep
sc so if some object disappears behind a barrier it would eventually reappear something a human being would think but the neural network might have no idea mm but even the notion of an object itself sc yeah mm so one example was in addition to alphago the google deep mind
