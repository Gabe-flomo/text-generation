episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and i bring 
bad news namely that the world is going to end not the world as in the earth that we 
on but the universe as a whole is going to come to an end some day we exactly know 
and what i mean by an end it might not be something as dramatic as literally the universe ceases 
exist but it might either change so dramatically that life itself would be impossible or it could just fade 
the universe could end with a bang or with a whimper so today i talk to one of the 
in this slightly depressing area katie mack is a theoretical cosmologist at north carolina state university also a very 
science communicator her twitter feed is one of the top ones that fellow physicists follow and we talk about 
different scenarios that sketch out what might happen to the future of the universe sc not something that we 
about for sure making predictions is hard especially about the future but we know enough about the laws of 
to say what the range of possibilities seems to be either this sort of gently fading out everything moves 
from everything else and we just get colder and slower until the interesting lively aspects of the universe just 
into nothingness or it could be something very dramatic my favorite scenario that we talk about in this episode 
the bubble of quantum death if not familiar with what that is be explained to you in grizzly detail 
this is both an educational episode in that we really do get into some real physics and cosmology but 
thought provoking that science has progressed to the point where we can actually say something about what the end 
the universe might be like remember if you want more info on mindscape you can go to the podcast

sc alright katie mack welcome to the mindscape podcast katie mack thanks good to be here sc gonna talk 
the universe a big universe out there km yes sc and i love the fact that writing a book 
the future of the universe km yes yeah yeah specifically the end because there are so many books about 
beginning i felt like we really gotta cover the other side sc there are and i noticed that when 
watch cosmos and they have the calendar right the cosmic calendar km yeah sc and the beginning of the 
is on january and the end is december and only alive for a little bit at the end but 
does the calendar km yeah yeah yeah sc should go on for a lot longer than km yeah yeah 
definitely yeah yeah it is interesting you always get up to today but i think people just really wanna 
about the future where all going and stuff like that and we just talk about that enough as physicists 
well and i think one thing to get right is the timescale so talk about the part of the 
we know the past because i think that a lot of people when you talk about the future the 
future thinking like ten years km right right right right yeah sc so tell us a little bit about 
size and scope of the universe as we know it now km well so right now our universe is 
billion years old and we know a lot about the beginning starting from a billionth of a second basically 
before that things get a little murkier about exactly what was going on but we have a really good 
for how things have evolved up now and starting to get a good understanding of where things are going 
we can map out the expansion of the universe and we can get a feel for the size of 
observable universe which is often used to mean the universe but when we talk about the observable universe talking 
a region that we can see that we can get information from and pretty big about fortysix billion light 
in radius something like that and that comes from just the fact that as the universe has been expanding 
this time there is a certain distance where if we tried to look farther away from that the light 
that part of the universe trying to look at would take longer than the age of the universe to 
here sc yeah so we know what the when you say the age even there you have to be 
right because we mean the age since the big bang km yeah sc there could have been something before 
big bang km sure and the other thing i should mention is that when people talk about the big 
a sort of public understanding of what the big bang is and then the way that physicists usually use 
and those are not always the same so if you talk to somebody on the street and say was 
big people will say it was an explosion where the universe started as a single point and then exploded 
and that was the big and if you talk to a physicist usually what talking about is something really 
called the hot big bang where what talking about is just simply the fact that the universe was hotter 
denser and smaller in the past and that just comes from the fact that the universe is expanding now 
cooling and so if we go back in time we can dial that back and we see that the 
was hotter and denser and more compressed in some way and that is completely incontrovertible like sc the big 
really did happen km yeah in that sense the big bang absolutely happened and we know that we can 
it sc yeah km we can actually see it directionally if we look far enough in any direction the 
is taking so long to get to us that coming from the time when the universe was still completely 
fire sc do you know the name eric lerner km yeah sort of sc author of a book called 
big bang never happened km oh really sc yeah km okay sc yeah back in the day and even 
my day the and when i was in grad school there were still people out there who just denied 
even the hot big bang model was correct km really huh sc yeah the plasma cosmology heard of this 
most important force in the universe is electromagnetism not gravity and so forth km oh no not that one 
no sc yeah km yeah i hear about that on twitter all the time sc and so yeah so 
certain amount of stomping out of myths that one has to do but okay the mindscape official position is 
big bang happened km yeah yeah i mean the hot yeah the fact that the universe was hotter and 
and in some sense smaller in the past and we can actually see it and one of the things 
think is kind of neat is the tv show the big bang theory the beginning of the theme song 
actually a really nice encapsulation of the big bang theory the whole universe was in a hot dense state 
fourteen billion years ago expansion started just stop there the big bang theory it sc exactly right it use 
word km nope sc it say there was a point km no say there was a point no singularity 
there may have been a singularity possible that before that fiery state that the universe was infinitely dense possible 
we get back to that point but that fiery state we see the part that was about years after 
beginning in the years a lot happened and we know at the very beginning of that if there was 
singularity we think probably there was this rapid expansion inflation and what happened before that super rapid expansion in 
first billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second we really know sc only on inflation myself 
yeah yeah and also sort of the standard cosmology but people have different models of that but i should 
that that really is inflation if it happened was ten to the minus thirtyfour seconds so pretty good from 
to the minus thirtyfour seconds onward which i think is an amazing achievement sc it is certainly an amazing 
but give the skeptics some evidence here so you said that we can only see things that are passed 
few hundred thousand years after the big bang but you also said we have a very good picture of 
on a second or less after so how do you get from here to there km well so there 
a few things that we can do one thing is that we can look at the patterns in that 
light from years after and we can learn something about the matter and energy content of the universe and 
expansion history from looking at really carefully analyzing those patterns another thing we can do is we can just 
that the universe was hotter and denser and we can do experiments that make hot dense little bits of 
and energy and figure out what physics is doing in those situations so collider experiments sc literal experiments here 
earth km yeah yeah so the large hadron collider can smash particles together and reach these really high energies 
the conditions would be very similar to some of the early universe stuff there are colliders that could make 
plasma which is the kind of precursor to the particles that we can detect today and what we think 
universe was filled with in this very very early time and so the fact that we can make a 
sample of a big bang universe is kind of cool km so that and then also some slightly more 
evidence from the abundance of elements called big bang nucleosynthesis so in this early hot stage there was a 
when the whole universe was as hot as the center of a star and so it was fusing elements 
and making helium and lithium and a little bit of other things out of hydrogen and so we can 
out what the abundance of those elements should be in the universe if that were taking place and it 
really well and so there are a few things like that where we we have a really good understanding 
charting out all the steps from that quarkgluon plasma stage through the couple hundred thousand years to the cosmo 
background this background light that we see and then from there on we have other kinds of observations sc 
i think that it is like you said amazingly impressive that the human race has been able to do 
teasing big bang denialists a few seconds ago but in the it would been completely sensible to be a 
bang denialist and one hundred years ago there were no pro big bang people the idea that the universe 
expanding been figured out so all this is the last century of human progress km yeah yeah yeah i 
neat that it was during career that we went from an understanding of the universe as being static to 
expanding one and it really changed the equations he was using to describe the evolution of the universe and 
totally changed our understanding of just how cosmic history works and where going in the future as well sc 
also a great example of the interplay of observations or experiments versus theory so you mentioned einstein einstein go 
any telescopes and collect any of this data but he is the one who set up the framework that 
use to think about the expansion of the universe km yeah and of course he the first person to 
about some of these things lemaitre and there were a couple other people who were putting together this idea 
the big bang theory and the expansion of the universe and everything but there is a kind of neat 
he was writing down equations that we still use to talk about the energy and matter content of the 
and he put in an extra term in these equations to account for the fact that the universe appear 
be static threw it out when the expansion started and now been shoving it back in because we need 
for another purpose which i can go into that if you like sc yeah we definitely do wanna go 
this i just wanna make sure that the audience appreciates the fact that general relativity theory of gravity is 
way that we talk about the expansion of the universe not just we look and see expanding we use 
to run it both forward and backward in time km yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah another astonishing achievement because 
relativity is the most bulletproof theory out there we throw everything we can at this thing and we found 
sc i know i tried km anomaly everything looks exactly as it should if general relativity is the law 
the land and never violated which is a little strange because we know that there has to be somewhere 
that true because quantum mechanics and general relativity tend not to work well together so gotta be gotta give 
in there maybe something about the interplay between quantum mechanics as a more subtle thing and they can both 
right in their own ways but it really has been amazing to watch all of these tests of general 
everything you can possibly think of and everything passes completely it all looks perfectly right even the gravitational waves 
black hole collisions that bygo has been seeing there was a signal simulated with computers using general relativity what 
signal should look like if these black holes collide and the signal comes in and it exactly matches completely 
no deviation sc yeah it exactly matches the prediction from some equations that einstein scribbled down in km yeah 
sc without any modification or improvement right km yeah yeah yeah yeah and just like that still sc used 
be nature yeah probably breaks down at the big bang or inside black holes but in the universe we 
general relativity there you go and so okay you hinted let you tell the punchline to this particular thing 
universe is expanding we can map out its expansion rate you already gave two hints about what gonna talk 
right now because you mentioned stuck this extra term in but you also said the universe is billion years 
and over fortytwo billion light years across how does this happen km that happens in terms of the size 
the universe i said that the size of the observable universe is set by how long it takes light 
get from the beginning to us and how far that could go and you would imagine that that should 
billion light years because light travels one light year per year and had billion years and so that seems 
it should make sense but the universe has been expanding since the beginning and so the point where light 
taken billion years to get to us has been pushed much farther away now because of the expansion of 
universe and a whole history of the expansion and one thing the factors into that is the fact that 
current expansion is going much faster than it seems like it should be this is something that has been 
real revolution in physics since the late km where one big question that sort of relates to the stuff 
in right now about the end of the universe one big question is is the universe gonna evolve in 
future we know that expanding now is that expansion gonna keep going forever is the expansion gonna turn around 
then we recollapse and have some kind of big crunch going on and so in the late they were 
to figure this out and really what you need to do to figure that out is you need to 
out the balance between the amount of matter in the universe the amount of gravity energy in the universe 
how quickly expanding km sort of the same physics as if you take a ball and you throw a 
up into the air if you throw it faster go higher up be slowing down the whole time and 
some point fall down if you could throw it at kilometers per second it would reach escape velocity it 
go off into space it would not fall down but it would always be slowing down a little bit 
it goes because that initial push is countered by gravity between the ball and the earth the whole time 
it should always be slowing down but it might keep going forever or it might turn around and come 
and so we were trying to figure this out for the universe because basically entirely the same physics applies 
had this initial push the big bang and then from there expanding but the gravity is trying to pull 
back so just trying to figure out there enough gravity that come so we wanted to know quickly is 
universe slowing down in its that deceleration rate so that we could figure out is it enough that really 
around or not they went out to measure sc this was by the way this is the hot topic 
i was a graduate student measuring how fast the universe was decelerating km yeah the deceleration parameter sc will 
eventually turn back or keep on expanding just ever more slowly km yeah yeah and so they wanted to 
this deceleration parameter and they went out to measure it and they found out that the deceleration parameter was 
negative number chuckle and the universe is not decelerating at all accelerating the expansion is going faster and faster 
was slowing down so the beginning was really really rapid expansion then been slowing for a long time and 
something like five billion years ago it starts speeding up and exactly as weird as if you throw a 
into the air and it goes up for a few feet slowing down and then just shoots off into 
chuckle the same weirdness in terms this does not work with our regular physics and so that was a 
mystery when that was discovered a lot of people were not sure if that really works what was going 
and you were active in the field at the time so you sc i was there km yeah but 
it turned out everything seemed to be fitting with an accelerating universe and so we had to figure out 
to make the universe expand faster and it turned out that that little term that einstein had put in 
equations at first to just keep the universe stable he thought that the universe was not expanding but all 
gravity so he had to have something to kinda balance that gravity out we put that back to balance 
gravity out and overcompensate and push galaxies apart from each other sc yeah the cosmological constant or the vacuum 
or whatever you wanna call it km yeah yeah the cosmological constant we usually write it as a lambda 
stuck with that now we know if a cosmological constant or not there are different kinds of what we 
dark energy that can do this that can make the universe expand faster so it may be that the 
energy is a cosmological constant it may be something that changes over time in a different kind of way 
we call it dark energy because we know what it is and we see it but making the universe 
faster and you have a better name for it right sc yeah i tried to call it smooth tension 
tension is a negative pressure and really what it is but like all my great ideas before their time 
km yeah yeah yeah your genius has not been recognized in this matter sc it trying so we have 
fact that the universe is accelerating we can explain it by imagining this vacuum energy or cosmological constant or 
tension which has the property that the same amount of energy in every cubic centimeter even as the universe 
but as you were km which is super weird i should point out sc which is super weird km 
weird normally the density of something will change as the size of the box its in gets bigger you 
a box and you make it twice as big you have a lower density of whatever was in the 
and dark energy like that you make the box twice as big now you have twice as much dark 
everything about this stuff is weird sc well be specific about the kind of weirdness exactly what the theory 
right km yes yes sc just weird to us to our experience km yeah yeah yeah never encountered a 
like that sc yeah i it rubs me the wrong way a little bit i think that people over 
the weirdness and mystery of the cosmological constant if there it just makes perfect sense we understand it perfectly 
some ineffable mystery why it has the value it does is a mystery but nature is not km yeah 
matches with the equations so i guess when talking about the weirdness i mean that nothing in our experience 
earth or in any other kind of experiment does what the cosmological constant does sc absolutely true yeah km 
it is very similar to physics to throwing a ball up in the air and having it shoot off 
space for no reason but on a cosmic scale okay of the cosmological constant sc so in your opinion 
a professional cosmologist what is the chance what is your credence that the dark energy is a cosmological constant 
something dynamical because it could also be something that is almost constant but changing a little bit km yeah 
yeah i feel like the data fit the cosmological constant so well and hard it it seems weirder to 
that something would mimic a cosmological constant so perfectly without actually being it but i know i wanna put 
much money on any particular thing there but i feel like i go with the cosmological constant as the 
assumption and until i see some kinda evidence for anything else just stick with that sc i vary between 
confidence that the cosmological constant of course it would be a world shattering discovery it was not so very 
worth going to look but it probably is km absolutely yeah yeah but tough because not much we can 
about it sc no km unfortunately it if it is a cosmological constant just a property of spacetime every 
bit of spacetime has this little push in it if you wanna think about it that way and so 
uniform over space utterly invisible all it does is stretch space and so the only two things you can 
are the expansion rate of the universe and the growth of structure in the universe how galaxies come together 
it sc and done that km there are no other measurements yeah yeah and done those measurements and it 
exactly like a cosmological constant and like chuckle there to be fair some of the alternatives have laboratory tests 
can do where you might be able to detect something cool in a lab but if it is a 
constant never gonna see any spatial variations everything will look exactly like just constant density forever expands the universe 
uniformly and it and just measure that more and more precisely sc yeah and the alternatives that you mentioned 
high risk high gain kinds of things be really really important if they were true but we think that 
probably are km yeah yeah but but there are some big mysteries around the cosmological constant which i think 
important to talk about and may be not talked about enough like the size of the cosmological constant the 
of the stuff inherent in spacetime is weird because when you do calculations about how much vacuum energy there 
be in space or how much the intrinsic energy in every little bit of space should be you get 
totally different number and that may be that we are terrible at those kinds of calculations but it seems 
there should it should be much bigger whatever the cosmological constant is it should be much more effective than 
is right now just this little bit of expansion currently dominating the universe the universe is getting really big 
everything else is diluting out but still way smaller in magnitude in terms of its effects than we think 
should be based on other kinds of calculations and so when we calculate vacuum energy from quantum field theory 
principles and compare that number to the cosmological constant a massive disagreement and sc so the mystery is not 
there is a cosmological constant but that so small without quite being zero km right right right yeah yeah 
so i think a really interesting question that maybe the point is that we need to better understand the 
and how that all fits together but nice that something that we have that we can say this is 
strange and we need to sort it rather than just like this is what we expected sc and so 
people have been driven to the multiverse and the anthropic principle because of exactly these reasons so again in 
professional capacity tell us what the truth is km oh gosh oh chuckle well so these multiverse ideas there 
lots of different kinds of multiverse ideas the i guess the one talking about is we have different vacua 
sort of regions of space where the cosmological constant might have different values so we have our observable universe 
seems really big to us but it might be a smaller part of some much larger space where there 
other pockets of universe with different values of the cosmological constant and it may be that ours is small 
because if it were way too big then you form galaxies and so it has to be kinda close 
zero and it have to be exactly zero and so we just happen to be in a region where 
quite zero but conducive to life and the anthropic argument for the cosmological constant never liked anthropic arguments i 
that entirely possible that be forced into this at some point that no other explanation that it is just 
environmental effect but never been appealing to me sc okay but i want you to give me a percentage 
yeah do that km oh gosh km a percentage on the multiverse or a percentage on the cosmological constant 
what it is because sc the anthropic principle km the anthropic principle like maybe sc yeah i think fair 
mean we know so little right i think just like if tomorrow a preprint arrived with a really killer 
for why the cosmological constant should have exactly its current value belief in the anthropic principle would plummet km 
yeah i mean there are some things that have to be described anthropically like the fact that we live 
the surface of a planet and not in deep space or in the center of the sun an anthropic 
right sc obvious anthropic explanations yes km but properties of the cosmos itself being anthropic less keen on those 
sc see but okay if the cosmological constant is the right answer to the dark energy if it is 
that is not changing as the universe expands so what does that tell us about the future what does 
future of the universe hold km well the standard picture of the future of the universe based on our 
cosmology is this idea that we have dark energy we have dark matter which i guess we can talk 
later and we have regular matter and the universe started with the big bang and been evolving ever since 
points to a kind of sad bleak future for the universe sc be judgy about the universe chuckle km 
mean okay maybe you can find this inspiring but basically what happens is the universe kinda fades to black 
this really long drawn out way because what happens is i mentioned before the cosmological constant is dominating the 
because if you have a universe where everything else dilutes and this thing then as the universe gets bigger 
be a higher and higher percentage of the universe and because every part of the universe that has cosmological 
in it is growing gonna make the universe expand faster and faster and faster and so eventually there will 
so much space between galaxies that we be able to see other galaxies anymore km the caveat is that 
heading toward us and so that one will hit us the andromeda galaxy will collide with ours in about 
billion years and our little local group of galaxies will coalesce into one big mess sc gravitationally bound to 
other but the ones that are not bound just like km yeah the ones that are far away sc 
you throw up into the air gonna go on forever km yeah yeah and so in something like one 
billion years we be able to see other galaxies anymore because be so far away and their light will 
so stretched out that we be able to pick up any information from them so extragalactic astronomy will be 
sc but again one hundred billion years km one hundred billion years yeah so a long time sc the 
is only fourteen billion years old now km yeah yeah so this is a long time and at some 
we be able to see the cosmo microwave background anymore because be too stretched out by the expansion and 
energy will be so dilute from the light from the cosmo microwave background so people in this very very 
future will not be able to figure out that the universe had a beginning and cosmology will be very 
and more limited sc be a lonely little island of universe unless we are able to successfully send them 
km yeah yeah yeah but nobody will be able to check this stuff from first principles and then then 
the universe keeps expanding since there other galaxies coming toward us anymore you get all this new material thrown 
the galaxy so you stop forming stars you use up all the hydrogen in our galaxy making stars then 
stars die and sort of fade out and then so eventually you have a bunch of black holes sc 
long does it take for the stars to fade out km oh many many many hundreds of billions of 
i mean some of these stars are very very long lived so i know exactly but you get many 
and then they just fade forever sc but eventually you run out of fuel right a stellar energy crisis 
yeah yeah yeah and then you make new stars and then a bunch of things just start collapsing into 
holes and those black holes then themselves start to evaporate so stephen hawking one of the things that he 
out is that black if you leave a black hole alone long enough it will start to lose mass 
particles quantum leaving sc evaporating km yeah i know how to explain it without getting into the details but 
so the black holes will start to evaporate particles will decay and be left in this cold dark empty 
and called the heat death sc and that lasts for how long km forever sc forever for infinity years 
i mean yeah but there is a sense in which at that point time stops mattering so once you 
to the real heat death this getting into your specialty but we reached the maximum entropy state of the 
so we get the sort of maximally disordered universe where all energy is just in the form of waste 
and very little called the heat death because energy turns into waste heat but that waste heat is at 
temperature of ten to the kelvin or something very little energy sc incredibly tiny yeah km yeah and then 
you have no structure you have no order and you just have a couple of stray photons and the 
entropy state and if at a maximum entropy state you no longer have an arrow of time sc nothing 
happening in any interesting sense km yeah yeah yeah so we define time by the direction where entropy is 
if entropy increase anymore what even is time sc so well there is time but i think you said 
correctly before it matter km no there yeah yeah sc no arrow of time no difference between one moment 
another just the same thing km yeah yeah so you have this eternal state of this cold dark empty 
sc i used to think that because of quantum fluctuations that such a universe would not be completely quiet 
would be fluctuations in boltzmann brains and even boltzmann solar systems and so forth i now think that that 
a mistake and it was just bad quantum mechanics i think the correct statement is if there were an 
measuring the quantum state of the universe they would occasionally see fluctuations into brains and so forth but not 
observers measuring anything nothing around the quantum state just sits there quietly unchanging forever and ever i think that 
a real heat death forever chuckle and the most likely one right of all that gonna give our listeners 
menu of options for the future do you think this is the most likely future km i mean i 
this is the one that seems to be the most clear extrapolation from the data you have to throw 
any new physics you have to extrapolate any of our current theories beyond the regime where they make sense 
in that sense i think the most clear extrapolation not fully convinced by the argument that there are no 
at that point there have been some really interesting cool suggestions that you can have a quantum fluctuation that 
a new universe or that creates just some moment in time from a current universe in a way that 
things can happen but that is super speculative we know for sure what the best way to do quantum 
in that environment is sc yeah no i do think right a footnote that i should have said in 
i just said which is that if you can bubble off a completely separate universe a baby universe then 
could continue to be created toward the future and maybe even the baby of somebody universe km yeah yeah 
mean i feel like kind of cold comfort because still dead chuckle sc yeah dead km i still consider 
the end of the universe sc dead anyway km yeah but i still feel like once our observable universe 
a heat death it for our universe maybe some other universe will happen but it be in any way 
to us carry no information from us and so nice to think that some kind of rebirth but it 
nothing to do with us sc has nothing to do with us certainly there was this old paper by 
dyson where he claimed that you could live forever in an internal universe km yeah so a caveat to 
though i was just talking with him a couple weeks ago actually about this been talking to a bunch 
people about it sc yeah writing a book km my book yeah and that only works for a universe 
expanding it work for an accelerating universe and so he was kind of bummed that his idea work anymore 
idea was that if you are in a universe expanding forever and you keep slowing down your processing and 
and stuff you can technically live forever sc but it was always a cheat still just running cycles more 
more slowly km yeah yeah yeah but i think it kinda gave him some sense of hope and now 
no it chuckle sc so it is weird a weird human quirk even if we think that one hundred 
from now we will certainly be dead part of us want the universe to die quadrillions of years from 
km yeah really fascinating really fascinating and this is something spending a lot of time thinking about writing this 
because the sense that if the universe is gonna end at some point we have no legacy some point 
which we stop having ever mattered sc the pointlessness of it all is really driven home km yeah yeah 
so you have to think about what does it how do you find meaning in life some people find 
in life through the fact that gonna have an impact on future generations or that they have children or 
they discover something amazing move humanity forward or just a nice person and nice things happen around you and 
do some good in the world whatever but if ultimately you send the future far enough nothing will nothing 
do will have ever mattered will ever matter again a little confronting and then you have to decide there 
way to assign meaning to your life where that life and that meaning and all of your impact sc 
the yolo universe you only live once and so enjoy the moment not the future the future is depressingly 
km yeah a very zen kind of thing you really have to be in the moment because nothing else 
it what got sc alright well thanks katie see if some other possible futures of the universe that are 
cheerful km well more cheerful the thing is it end well sc i think that there are any more 
ones by the way chuckle yeah a rhetorical setting you up for failure here sorry km yeah yeah never 
happy story but there are more dramatic ends of the universe so the heat death is the standard picture 
dark energy is something other than a cosmological constant if something that changes over time nothing to say that 
turn around and go from doing expansion to contracting and if the case then we can end with a 
crunch sc the opposite of the big bang km yeah so that would be where the expansion would at 
point stop turn around and everything would come together again and a really exciting one because the galaxies would 
get compressed and start interacting with each other and merging and then everything gets just more and more dense 
and more crowded and the cool thing about the big crunch as an end of the universe scenario is 
it has this really neat feature about how the stars die so you would think you have a whole 
of galaxies colliding with each other the stars would collide and blow up or something what you would imagine 
actually when galaxies collide the chance of stars individually hitting each other is tiny even when gonna collide with 
in four billion years the chance that any single stars hit each other in that collision is vanishingly small 
the space is very big km the space is huge yeah and even when galaxies are coming together the 
is huge but in a big crunch universe the space is compressing not just the matter but also all 
the radiation and so this cosmic microwave background floating around from the big bang that energy will be compressed 
to the energy density it was in the early universe and so start to get to that hot plasma 
again but even worse in the time since the big bang had all these star shining so all this 
energy radiation floating around xrays and uv and visible light and start being compressed as well and so be 
by this radiation background from all the starlight from all the stars that have ever shone and then at 
point it gets so compressed that the surfaces of stars catch fire they have thermonuclear explosions on the surfaces 
stars sc as opposed to the middle of the star where we now have them yeah km yeah yeah 
stars will start to be cooked from the inside out and at that point nothing is survivable chuckle it 
so the big crunch is not just the big bang run backward in time km no worse sc not 
time reversed km yeah yeah actually worse than going back to the big bang sc the question is is 
better to burn out than fade away either way your goose is cooked but in the heat death you 
slide into oblivion and in the crunch you get roasted to death and you burn you can predict you 
when gonna happen if the universe were collapsing through general relativity we could be able to say exactly how 
we have left km yeah if we had measured a really high deceleration parameter we would have a date 
would have a number for how quickly gonna happen and i feel like that would be kind of a 
concept sc way worse than heat death in my mind km yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean km i 
the one thing that people find some hope in is that some of these big crunch models have a 
so where a big crunch then a new big bang afterward again not our universe still done but some 
like that idea laughter sc yeah so even if we bounce into something saying our universe can bounce but 
no record of us km yeah yeah exactly yeah sc we have no way of sending books through the 
or cds km no sc whatever podcasts km yeah yeah sc yeah km i can get to it later 
are some models of a bouncing universe where you get a little bit of surviving through the bounce but 
one where have a big crunch is not one of them so yeah the big crunch and also another 
that dark energy can go wrong that can give you a different end of the universe which is something 
phantom dark energy and this is theoretically a mess and i know you like it sc i have my 
okay a free country km yeah a cool idea so the regular cosmological constant has the density the same 
all the time and if you have something called phantom dark energy the density of the dark energy is 
over time and what that does is it means that suddenly the dark energy is able to not just 
galaxies apart from each other but start pulling galaxies apart themselves and ripping stars off galaxies ripping planets away 
their stars and so as the density of dark energy increases increases over time you get to a point 
it rips the entire universe apart so first it gets the clusters of galaxies then the galaxies then the 
and then atoms and then the whole universe is just rent asunder called the big rip sc this also 
bad km yeah yeah and this is another one where it would be terrifying we could predict it if 
measured a certain kind of dark energy we would have a date so a parameter that we measure for 
energy now called the equation of state parameter we call it w and it has to do with the 
between the pressure and the density of dark energy and right now we measure it looks like exactly minus 
or very very close to it if a little less than minus one then phantom dark energy and that 
to a big rip and once you know the number what that w is it tells you exactly how 
years you have till the big rip happens and right now the data are consistent with but the best 
part of the data like the sc is the constant energy in cubic centimeters km yeah the cosmological constant 
but the best fit like measurement right now is just a little bit less than minus one sc there 
air bars km but the air bars are so big we really have no idea sc not alarm people 
much km absolutely yeah no no but you can calculate a minimum amount of time our universe has within 
of the data and so we know that we have at least one hundred twenty billion years and so 
as we measure closer and closer to what really is that number will get higher and higher and so 
now we have at least one hundred twenty billion years with the next experiments looking for measuring w maybe 
to i know five hundred billion years or whatever so presumably if w really is minus one if we 
live in a cosmological constant universe just keep pushing that doomsday farther and farther back sc yeah km but 
neat idea that you can calculate it exactly if out there now your objection to phantom dark energy is 
theoretically a mess right it breaks energy conditions a reason why you have dark energy increasing in energy density 
all the time bad things happen in the theory but i like the idea that you can extend the 
space of your model just a little bit and destroy the universe laughter sc and worth mentioning that this 
that as the energy density increases it rips apart galaxies and stars and so forth is unique to these 
energy models where the energy is increasing the cosmological constant rip galaxies apart km yeah yeah the cosmological constant 
expands really empty space wherever those gravitationally bound things cosmological constant is not gonna mess with those basically because 
certain amount of dark energy in that region and your matter is already bound in that region not gonna 
more dark energy in that region the energy density increase over time sc and these you hinted at this 
but maybe worth emphasizing that trying to experimentally distinguish between these possibilities more possibilities to come but laid out 
you have the heat death the crunch the recollapse or the big rip but actually trying to ask which 
is real km yeah yeah but measuring how dark energy works is one of the is basically the main 
that we can try and distinguish between these models if we figure out exactly what dark energy has been 
and what it is doing now we can extrapolate it in the future to decide if we think gonna 
keep going the way it is get stronger or turn around or get weaker or something sc and what 
the best ways to do this measurement km well again dark energy is a tough thing to measure so 
basically can measure the expansion history or the growth rate of structure when we measure the cosmic microbe background 
in the spectrum we can get some hints from that as well because it affects the shapes of the 
in that that we see from here so we can get some information that way and then there are 
these experiments like lab experiments testing alternative models but mostly just really really carefully measuring how the universe has 
expanding since early times sc so what are the biggest experiments gonna do this for us km well one 
lsst which is the large synoptic survey telescope is gonna do a sky survey many times observe the same 
of sky many times over and sweep the whole sky repeatedly and gonna give us a really great survey 
galaxies and things like that surveys that look at distant supernovae can tell us something about that because they 
measure the expansion rate based on understanding supernovae and figuring out how far away they are and then learning 
about the expansion that way one of the ways we do it a couple of other telescopes that are 
of specifically aimed at looking for dark energy stuff dark energy camera dark energy survey these kinds of things 
you mentioned largescale structure maybe explain a little bit more how dark energy affects the largescale structure km yeah 
when i say largescale structure i mean like how galaxies and clusters of galaxies are laid out in the 
this kind of cosmic web where you get clusters and you get sort of filaments where galaxies lie along 
filaments and then big voids and if we can measure the how that large scale structure is laid out 
can sort of extrapolate how it formed and how been growing over time and so that can tell us 
about how dark energy has been influencing this because gravitational collapse is how galaxies and clusters of galaxies grow 
always fighting against the expansion of the universe and as the expansion is getting faster preventing more collapse of 
and so the shapes and sort of statistics of large scale structure can tell us a lot about in 
universe and how changing over time sc so like throwing a bunch of baseballs up in the air and 
which ones fly away and which ones come back to km yeah yeah like like if trying to i 
if trying to put together a puzzle and sort of pulling the table apart while doing it you can 
sc yeah a rush competition km yeah so you can figure out by how well you can put it 
this puzzle going on on the table sc so certainly sounds like the dark energy is the important thing 
figuring out the future of the universe km yeah for that stuff but some caveats there another model for 
end of the universe that really have anything to do with dark energy and comes out of our understanding 
particle physics so something been kind of in vogue lately because of measurements sent at the large hadron collider 
this is called vacuum decay so vacuum sc this is what sure everyone has been waiting for the vacuum 
this is the coolest part km this is the absolute best most interesting way for the universe to end 
okay so just gonna start with the standard model of particle physics the standard model of particle physics is 
sort of our encapsulation of all of the particles of nature and the forces of nature as we understand 
through experiments okay so we have a certain collection of particles we have quarks and leptons and we have 
gauge bosons which are force carriers and so there are all these particles that we understand measured and we 
how they work and that constitutes the standard model of particle physics and sort of final piece of that 
model was the higgs boson which was discovered at the large hadron collider in and that tells us something 
how particle physics changed in the very early universe and gave us the sort of nice happy universe we 
today where we have atoms can come together and form sc chemistry happens yeah km chemistry and yeah so 
of that works because of what happened with the higgs field this sort of energy field pervading space in 
very early universe and the higgs boson is an excitation of the higgs field a little sort of piece 
that higgs field that we can break off and examine with our colliders sc interested listeners can buy a 
about that that i wrote so chuckle km right chuckle exactly yeah and so once you have the whole 
model of particle physics and the higgs boson part of that you can start to kind of examine how 
mechanism happened and whether it happened in a way that gave us a really stable universe or not and 
you can kinda chart out based on the masses of the higgs boson the top quark where we lie 
this landscape of stable universes or non stable universes and when i say stable i mean a universe where 
the workings of particle physics are expected to just stay the same forever sc forever yeah km or you 
have an unstable universe where it would already have destroyed itself like it already work at all or you 
have called a metastable universe where particle physics is fine for now but eventually all gonna fall apart sc 
gotta tell us more about what does it mean all gonna fall apart km yeah so what i mean 
that is so i have to say a little bit about the higgs field so the higgs field is 
sort of energy field pervading space and particles interact with the higgs field and that kind of determines the 
of particles okay so an electron or whatever interaction with the higgs field interacts with higgs field a little 
so it has a little bit of mass a quark top quark or something which is quarks are constituents 
protons and neutrons top quarks are not part of protons and neutrons but they are cousins of the ones 
are that one interacts with higgs field in a slightly different way they have a higher mass and so 
so something about particles interacting with higgs field that tells you something about the masses but the higgs field 
can change over time and the value of the higgs field sort of the amount of energy in it 
changed since the very early universe sc right so just not just hypothetical that we think it could change 
think it really did change km it did change sc the higgs field had a different value early on 
yeah yeah and so the higgs feels had a different value early on and now it has a certain 
that we can kinda measure and possible that another value it could take that would be somehow energetically favorable 
the way people usually draw this is like you have like a valley and you have like a ball 
in a valley and pretty stable but if that valley is not really a valley is just a little 
of divot in the side of a much deeper valley then your little pebble or whatever can sit in 
divot but if something kicks it a little bit it can fall off and end up somewhere else in 
deeper valley km and that deeper valley would be the stable state and this little divot higher up is 
stable because energetically favorable to give it a little push and then it falls down and it lands somewhere 
kinda like if you have a cup of tea right at the edge of a table sort of stable 
if you tap it a little bit gonna fall down gonna hit the ground and where really stable so 
want to put your tea on the ground or you wanna put it right near the edge of a 
sc but saying the higgs field had its current value for something like billion years but nevertheless it might 
temporary km but yeah yeah yeah so possible that you know not like right at the edge of the 
our tea cup is in the middle of the table but still room for it to sc a chance 
km off a way it could fall off and in normal life if you have a tea cup in 
center of your table probably not not gonna end up on the floor unless you do something really dramatic 
knock it over but unfortunately the universe on the scale of fields like the higgs field is fundamentally quantum 
and with quantum mechanics you get quantum tumbling and so we live in a universe where very unlikely that 
could actually move the higgs field to this other minimum if that minimum does exist but if you leave 
alone long enough it could tunnel right through and end up in the other minimum like if you going 
tons of analogies here sc please no helpful yeah km if you have this pebble in this divot on 
valley in this edge of this valley something could kick it over but imagine that it would take a 
of energy to kick it over but imagine also the edge of that divot is kind of soft and 
could fall through and then just end up rolling all the way down and ending up at the bottom 
the hill and this on the face of it maybe this sound so bad we know what the higgs 
is doing in our daily life what does it matter what the strength is well it turns out that 
you change the value of the higgs field you change fundamental constants of nature in such a way that 
hold together anymore sc no more chemistry no more of that km no more chemistry no yeah everything is 
and then also if it does go to a the higgs field goes to a much higher value then 
some sense everything gets more massive and then you can have a gravitational collapse of the entire universe once 
happens sc that sounds bad yeah km yeah yeah and so not a good thing so we wanna end 
in that other minimum of the higgs field called the true vacuum we apparently live in a false vacuum 
called a false vacuum not like the real vacuum state of the universe not the sc it for all 
final one so but wait so just to be saying that not only is it conceivable that there is 
vacuum state where the higgs field has even lower energy than it wants to go to but that we 
true km yeah yeah the the data point to the probability that there is another vacuum that we live 
a false vacuum and that a true vacuum out there in theory where our higgs field could quantum tunnel 
the true vacuum sc and does the tunneling happen all at once all throughout the universe how does km 
no a cool thing so a i should say a very low probability event like any quantum tunneling event 
likely to happen but if you leave it alone long enough eventually it will but the way it would 
is we have higgs fields throughout all of space and at any point in space the higgs field could 
tunnel to the true vacuum at any moment with very low probability and what would happen is if the 
field does tunnel at one point in space then as soon as it tunnels there kinda knock all of 
higgs field around it into the true vacuum as well and then so be this expanding bubble of true 
now true vacuum is a space we cannot live in just to be very clear and as this bubble 
it has a sort of bubble wall this high energy sort of shell so that starts incinerating anything it 
and then once it passes over something that whatever it pass over ends up inside the true vacuum where 
hold together and maybe collapses on itself sc right either explodes or collapses not gonna stick around km yeah 
so this bubble then expands at likely about the speed of light or very close to the speed of 
and expands the universe and just destroys absolutely everything because happening at the speed of because this bubble is 
at the speed of light you absolutely cannot see it coming so if were if it started on the 
side of the room by the time the light gets to you from the bubble the bubble is on 
of you and is eating you up so you see coming fortunately you also feel anything because your nerve 
do not travel at the speed of light so you have a chance to feel it hit you but 
would destroy absolutely everything and it could happen at any moment technically very very unlikely but you know the 
field in this room there could be a quantum tunneling event right now that would create this bubble of 
vacuum and just destroy everything sc and we mainly know that unlikely because it happened yet right km well 
happened yet but also we can try and measure the parameters of the higgs field in such a way 
we can infer that the tunneling time is very long and so estimates seen give us something like ten 
the one hundred or ten to the five hundred years before likely to happen in our observable universe so 
know that suggests that by the time this is happening we probably care sort of well on our way 
the heat death probably it make a big difference but one thing that been working on recently this calculation 
was done by a few others that showed that if you have a very small black hole as evaporating 
can trigger vacuum decay so it can basically in its sc you could hurry it up km yeah so 
little black hole as evaporating can make the probability of tunneling in its vicinity much higher and so if 
leave a black hole alone long enough and let it evaporate all the way then it can make vacuum 
happen and conceive that event and we know there are lots of black holes in our galaxy and eventually 
the heat death is progressing those black holes are gonna stop pulling matter in and start just evaporating so 
you calculate the lifetime of our observable universe based on the black holes we know about evaporating got only 
less time chuckle still sc still a lot of time km still something like ten of the sixtynine years 
not fully sure that black holes can do this to the vacuum not even fully sure if vacuum decay 
happen sc and that ten and sixtynine years comes from imagining that we have black holes the mass of 
sun or km five solar masses yeah sc five solar masses that we know about if there are small 
holes in the universe it could happen a lot faster km if there are small black yeah yeah yeah 
one of the things that you can do with these calculations is you can show that as long as 
decay is possible we have had little black holes of a certain size produced during the big bang which 
something people talk about sometimes primordial black holes sc they be the dark matter km sorry sc they be 
dark matter for example km yeah there are caveats on that for the masses of them and there are 
mass ranges where not fully rolled out but really small ones that would have evaporated by now might have 
the universe so probably not there sc so literally at every point in space in this universe which has 
radius of billion light years across a chance small one that the higgs boson field flips into some larger 
a bubble that expands at the speed of light and will eventually hit us and all die km yep 
sc could we hurry that up not only if making black holes but at the large hadron collider are 
gonna trigger doom on ourselves km no no we do it the lhc okay so what you could imagine 
if we could make a little black hole then that thing could trigger it but what we can do 
smashing particles together at the large hadron collider is way less powerful than what cosmic rays do in space 
the time and measured cosmic rays particles like nuclei coming from distant galaxies whatever particles protons at energies so 
higher than the large hadron collider we even come close to creating collisions that energetic and so just the 
that those collisions are happening all the time in space and have not destroyed us suggest that really no 
way that we with our little smashing of particles here on earth can do anything even slightly dangerous sc 
no prospect of a dr strangelove day device from using vacuum decay km no sc so disappointing km been 
with some colleagues about possibilities for can you do this on purpose and it seem possible sc gonna get 
on some watchlist if you send email about these things km yeah yeah yeah a maybe side topic but 
as far as we know no way to make a little black hole the cosmic rays are clearly not 
it and i actually have a paper that i just wrote with my colleague bob ames about calculating the 
that cosmic rays are not making little black holes that destroy the universe can tell you something about higher 
and space because easier to make black holes if we have higher dimensions of space and so the fact 
little black holes have not been created and then correct your vacuum decay can tell you something about these 
dimensions so there are ways to use these kinds of things to think about new things in physics sc 
lemonade out of some lemons here km yeah yeah yeah sc using the fact that we are still here 
died to constrain parameters of the universe km yeah and fun fun to do all these what if things 
may sound like a scary thing the idea that the universe could have this bubble of quantum death that 
and kills everything sc bubble of quantum km yeah sc a good band name but a scary prospect km 
but still so poorly understood how all this stuff might work that at the moment the best we could 
is try and do some calculations try and get something cute out of it try and learn something from 
kind of hypothetical maybe this will happen maybe it what does that tell us what can we extrapolate from 
and one of the main reasons that interesting to think about the end of the universe because it tells 
something about the assumptions of your physical model and so if you extrapolate take what we know and extrapolate 
all the way to the edge of our knowledge what does that tell us that can either tell us 
about the far future or can just tell us something about what kind of assumptions making about our model 
how we can use that to better understand the physics of today and so kind of fun so this 
that looking at little black holes and vacuum decaying cosmic rays and all this stuff really just taking all 
tools we have and trying to understand a little bit more about real present day physics from these wild 
which a fun thing to do sc so even a silver lining on the cloud of the complete death 
everyone you know and love laughter km yeah yeah yeah exactly and to be sc the cosmic perspective is 
quite useful sometimes km and to be fair i should say really no reason to worry about vacuum decay 
first of all very unlikely several people say that probably it just means that we understand our theory and 
idea that vacuum decay is even possible is pointing to some kind of pathology in the theory but also 
like like you feel it you even notice it because you see it coming you feel it sc not 
bad way to go yeah km nobody would miss you no tragic aftermath sc this is very cold comfort 
km i know i feel like there are things that we can worry about that are much more immediate 
that we have some control over sc true but to tie it back to something we said before in 
case of the big rip or the big crunch we could plausibly imagine and you could predict exactly when 
was going to happen km yeah yeah yeah sc one of the features of vacuum decay is you have 
idea km no idea at all sc and you would not even know that made a mistake km yeah 
sc be here be walking to the grocery store optimistic about what you were gonna cook that night and 
gone km yeah and one of the frustrating things about it is that you get to find out if 
you can do calculations sc what really matters km yeah yeah yeah you can never publish right sc yeah 
know exactly km the point sc no more citation counts after the death of the universe km yeah yeah 
and important to remember that the idea of vacuum decay destroying the universe this is an old idea this 
in sidney colman and friends came up with this idea km yeah yeah yeah sc but i just wanna 
across to myself as well as to the audience that a new piece of information now not just that 
maybe there are some fields out there that could decay and that would wipe everything out but oh no 
fields we know about and have detected could be responsible for this km yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and 
best measurements of the higgs field based on what done with the large hadron collider really point to this 
this idea that the universe is stable for now but not forever and if you leave it alone long 
it will do vacuum decay sc and not sure there could be new fields or whatever getting in the 
km right right yeah yeah another thing that suggests that we worry about this too much is that just 
whole idea of vacuum decay depends on the assumption that the standard model of particle physics is the whole 
and we know it be we know that there it fit well with general relativity and then we know 
be something replace or modify the standard model of particle physics whether modify it in a way such as 
save us from vacuum decay we know but very plausible that something will come up change our understanding of 
decay in a way that will mean that it was never a worry to begin with but if we 
just take the standard model of particle physics fully seriously and extrapolate all the way then this is what 
data tell us and the standard model of particle physics has been very successful passed every test that thrown 
it but just like general relativity pretty sure it be the whole picture gotta be something else dark matter 
dark energy fit in the standard model of particle physics sc yeah km therefore there really has to be 
else that chances our idea sc dark energy fits pretty easily but dark matter is km well dark well 
a cosmological concept than not really part of that question but if some kind of dynamical field it fit 
but you did mention and if it is a dynamical field you mentioned the slightly more hopeful prospect that 
could crunch in some sense but then be reborn in a few next universe km yeah sc we could 
instead of just crunching km sure sure yeah and so there are several ideas that have been around for 
while that involve some kind of collapse and bounce an idea that was first described by my phd advisors 
steinhard and neil turo which is this idea that maybe in the very early universe instead of a very 
expansion there was some kind of slow compression happening and that could explain some of the same things that 
seem to see in the early universe and that compression was the universe getting ready to sort of expand 
and so you can have a universe that expands and then has some kind of compression and then expands 
and kinda goes in and out and has this sort of bouncing cyclic nature that model is called the 
model and been going through various variations over the years km at first it involves two parallel universes slamming 
each other and then coming apart and bouncing back and forth like hands clapping now a model that require 
dimensions and other universes but has a sort of similar compression and expansion cycle that goes on so there 
some of those kinds of models floating around that have these cycles and in some of these models you 
have something kind of surviving through the cycle and so it go completely singular where you go to fully 
density and then bounce off of that you can have a sort of slower bounce and maybe something interesting 
go through there sc okay but again just to be clear km yeah sc not a prospect that build 
really secure safe km no no sc and put some information in there km no no sc and send 
time capsule into the future km yeah it basically destroy everything but you might have sort of traces of 
fluctuations in the matter density or something that could pass through and something like that sc so what are 
chances that when we look at the cosmic microwave background carefully enough decode signals from previous universes km well 
depends on who you ask also this model by roger penrose sc previous podcast guest km okay sc roger 
yes km yeah yeah sc we talked about it km yeah where looking for these signals in the cosmic 
background that would come from a previous cycle and whether or not been anything seen there is very controversial 
people say there are weird little fluctuations that are probably statistical noise but possible as we keep examining the 
microwave background we might see something that indicates some previous cycle or some kind of an interaction with another 
of universe also a model where you have little bubble universes that start in through the inflation process and 
bubbles could collide with each other and we could see a feature of that in the cosmic group background 
well km so although the cosmic group background is really looking at the very early universe it could tell 
something about the future of the universe through giving us some insight into how our universe started and whether 
with a cyclic kind of model or even a multiverse kind of model sc personally not a fan of 
of these cyclic models just because they make it impossible to solve the arrow of time problem they require 
infinite amount of fine tuning in the entropy of the universe infinitely far ago but i could be wrong 
that or maybe the same amount of fine tuning who knows km yeah kind there are a lot of 
ways things could go right now because a lot that we are still not really understanding about how physics 
in this very fundamental way because we lack a theory of quantum gravity and because there are now these 
going on about maybe if space and time really fundamental and maybe these are just sort of emerging from 
else something quantum perhaps as been talking about maybe stuff going on that is so far out of our 
that all of our assumptions about what how universes should and behave are just wrong sc yeah yeah look 
the people who are not professional physicists out there are there prospects for getting it right is this just 
philosophical speculation or do you think actually making progress on these questions km on the question of the future 
the universe sc of the future and the past why there are cycles is there different vacuums km yeah 
been going around talking to people about this for a couple of weeks or a couple of months really 
the question of how are we gonna figure this out how are we gonna figure out our cosmic model 
the future of the universe and not really consensus among the people talked to some people are optimistic that 
really figure it out i was just talking with clifford johnson yesterday and a string theorist worked sc previous 
guest clifford johnson yes km yeah and very optimistic that gonna figure it out but optimistic on time scales 
maybe take one hundred years whereas talked to some other people who say just have no idea going on 
experiments giving us anything useful our observations getting us anything useful and theoretically stuck in the so i think 
an interesting time right now because all of our particle physics experiments are fully consistent with the standard model 
particle physics all of our measurements of the cosmic evolution are fully consistent with the concordance cosmology dark matter 
energy expansion big bang general relativity is passing every test with flying colors but we know that those things 
fit together in a fully consistent fundamental theory and so we know got to be at some point gotta 
and we know what it is and we have any clues really pointing us in a direction to figure 
out km and so maybe we just need more data and as we get more data start to see 
the cracks lie maybe we need an advance in theory and maybe better understanding something like quantum information will 
us the path to a new theory tie everything together and show us how all these pieces fit but 
the moment kind of all up in the air which is interesting because we we have these models that 
so predictive and so perfectly fitting the data and we really understand very well what the universe is made 
how long been around how evolved over billion years we know all that so well we can calculate everything 
can measure everything but fundamentally something missing about the fundamental nature of reality and an interesting place to be 
yeah as a scientist where you wanna be we would like more observational experimental clues km we would yeah 
wanna find something weird that we explain with our current models that would be nice and so far not 
whole lot of that out there there are a couple of weird little anomalies that may or may not 
telling us about new physics but nothing that says be explained by our current models therefore we need to 
a model that does explain we have anything like that other than the sort of the inconsistencies between these 
successful pictures that work in different regimes sc and at a more personal level not you as a person 
we as look been talking about time scales of ten to one hundred years or infinity years and on 
one hand by the way i guess i said this out loud yet but it to me it seems 
if we should be very puzzled by the fact that the universe is ten to the ten years of 
past and infinity years or one hundred years to the future we live in the really really beginning of 
universe by any sensible measure why is that is there a good reason for that i think these are 
questions of support but the other is does it actually affect how you go through your life does it 
how you think about your existence as a person or your job as a scientist when you can actually 
back and contemplate the fact that in most of our sensible extrapolations to the future no remnant no bit 
information about your existence will still be anywhere to be found km yeah and been thinking about this a 
one of the things that i ask when been interviewing people about this for the book one question i 
everybody is how do you feel about the end of the universe how does it affect your life your 
and i get lots of different answers some people are super depressed about it some people find the idea 
the heat death super boring and desperate to find something else some people are totally cool like zen living 
the moment whatever great that we last forever for me i think that i find it a little troubling 
idea that we have no legacy i find that a little bit hard to think about without feeling sad 
i also find that having my head in these clouds all the time but not a head in the 
in terms of something inconsequential this is real physics this is actual universe that thinking about so removed from 
but not imaginary i do find that a sense in which kind of comforting when i think about my 
problems in my little life the universe is gonna end what does it matter sc yeah maybe before this 
proposal deadline km yeah yeah yeah so it sort of does put some things in perspective and even the 
that we have no legacy ultimately i experienced the loss of my family a little while ago and part 
the grieving process i was thinking about that gone and that was really sad but i also thought all 
go eventually even the whole universe is gonna end the important thing is that we make the most of 
time we i spent quality time with my grandmother while she was here and now gone and just like 
the universe we can spend quality time with our universe now and eventually go away and that mean meaningless 
think even if gone still some meaning that it was here that we were here that we as thinking 
figured some stuff out i think still a meaningful and important thing sc i cannot even imagine anything to 
to that katie mack thanks so much for being on the podcast km thank you for having me music 
am really enjoying this podcast i particularly like the episodes where sean hosts another physicist two physicists talking about 
that both experts on is fun to listen to because sometimes i get to hear two different expert perspectives 
topics please continue to host physicist colleagues sean hey sean could you please add the ability to rewind the 
in small time increments the podcast there were a lot of things said in this podcast that i wanted 
hear again for mental clarity but i had no way of going back just ten seconds could you please 
bettrr scroll features to your podcast pingback stuff the internet says on scalability for november two thousand nineteen aws 
hey ryan i use downcast for my podcasts and its default skip back options are fifteen seconds or thirty 
which is perfect for when i need to hear something two or three times joe simplesmente impressionada pela positiva 
mack é incrível um diálogo muito elucidativo sem dúvida seja a hipótese de morte por calor não ter mais 
seta do sejam as outras hipóteses na verdade só lamentável não temos legado conforme katie mack refere há que 
ao máximo o tempo que temos viver o momento e sentirmonos gratos como seres pensantes que descobrimos alguma coisa 
sean carroll obrigada katie mack i love this podcast and this episode is one of the best thanks sean 
katie this podcast sparked an metaphor for how the universe is accelerating about throwing a ball straight up having 
slow down then speed up is a great visual could it be that this is proof of another mass 
universes beyond this one causing a gravitational pull on the edge of the universe so using the ball metaphor 
i threw a ball at venus it would slow down getting through gravity travel through space at that slowed 
velocity but then speed up again as it gets pulled into venus and finally land at whatever the terminal 
is on venus perhaps the edges of our universe are hitting a gravitational pull and accelerating towards it if 
acceleration is uneven around us perhaps there are multiple universes around us of varying mass causing the variation in 
this is a different approach to a form dark energy or matter comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations
