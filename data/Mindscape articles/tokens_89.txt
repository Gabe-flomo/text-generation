hello everybody and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today thinking about the future implicitly 
course we think about the future a lot on this podcast and elsewhere but today being a bit more 
about it there are people who describe themselves and are described by the outside world as professional futurists whose 
it is to predict what will happen down the road but this other genre which is also very successful 
science fiction writing fictional narratives that are often set in the future not necessarily trying to predict exactly what 
happen but at least to imagine different possible futures sc this helps us think about how we should approach 
future as well as how we should approach the present when i was a kid i was a big 
fiction fan mostly reading novels but also watching tv and movies but i can tell you from reading more 
science fiction that the level of sophistication has gone way up both the literary quality and also the scientific 
of modern science fiction is as high as ever been in fact on podcast i put forward the hypothesis 
modern science fiction writers are in some sense the last great generalists because not only do you have to 
a lot about science you also have to understand a lot about humanity so you need to understand sociology 
psychology and you need to be able to write you need to be able to tell a good story 
invoke a vivid world to invent interesting and colorful characters sc so our guest today annalee newitz is absolutely 
of those generalists someone who can think in interesting ways about a wide variety of things annalee got her 
in english and american studies from berkeley but then she became a writer specializing in science and technology she 
the founder of the famous blog she was then the editorinchief of gizmodo and right now the editor at 
at ars technica where she has a very wide variety of experience writing about both individual technological breakthroughs and 
the background science behind these breakthroughs recently annalee has decided to turn that experience to writing science fiction she 
science fiction writer charlie jane anders actually cohost their own podcast which recently started called our opinions are correct 
which charlie jane and annalee discuss the meaning of science fiction i encourage you to check that out and 
her recent novel called annalee deals with the biochemistry of pharmaceuticals the ethics of robotics and artificial intelligence and 
favorite the economics of what it means to have a right to work sc she talks about slavery and 
and people trying to work in different parts of the world we take for granted the idea that allowed 
work but maybe in the future that be the case this is the kind of speculative scenario that science 
is perfectly made for so on the podcast talk about science technology science fiction the difference between writing fiction 
nonfiction and how we should think about what the future has in store so go music sc annalee newitz 
to the mindscape podcast annalee newitz yeah thanks for having me sc so i was reading an article in 
from a few months ago by you and if i could paraphrase the lesson it would be that science 
needs more economics in it is that accurate and do you actually believe that an i actually do believe 
i thought it was very clever for coining the phrase dismal science fiction which i probably really coin but 
felt like i did at the time and to sort of describe this cluster of issues that shows up 
some science fiction novels where and also some fantasy as well where we kind of see characters grappling with 
economic dimensions of going on whether space travel and colonizing other worlds or whether getting a grant to study 
which we almost never see in science fiction and like it consumes the lives of scientists actually a big 
of how you do science sc it certainly is just for the audience out there i read wonderful debut 
and yeah a lot more about being the principal investigator in that novel and applying for grants that read 
almost any other novel that i can remember an so gotten a lot of appreciative tweets from graduate students 
at last our labor has been yeah i think that one of the things we talk about a lot 
science fiction writers is world building and how do you make an imaginary world feel lived in and feel 
so that your you know partly so your reader has a fun experience but also so that it actually 
people to really rethink reality which is ultimately what writing about since we actually travel into the future and 
on it an and i think that especially right now economics are becoming a really important part of how 
think about science how we deal with each other shaping the future and so some writers are dealing with 
more and more and also economists are really interested in building scenarios about the future too so i feel 
a lot of good opportunities there for us to be thinking about basically thinking about science in context if 
makes sense like sort of thinking about not just like we discovered a new but how did that happen 
did this dude get to be the one who discovered this particle out of all the people who were 
on the project or how did this project get the funding that allowed them to discover the particle why 
this particle accelerator lose its funding why did this one even though it has lots of problems get to 
its funding all these weird questions that sound really wonky but actually part of making a really exciting story 
part of fun is seeing people struggle to get what they want and that struggle just shooting particles down 
accelerator although that would be cool if it were sc that would be cool but right not exactly what 
is i have to ask before i forget have you read the famous paul krugman article about the economics 
faster than light travel an i have yeah and that sparked a huge debate that was part of a 
debate within the science fiction community and people like charles straus were proposing for a while that we have 
kind of ultra realistic science fiction mundane science fiction basically where we were just not gonna have faster than 
travel because it was just absurd and so a few people signed on for that and charlie straus wound 
getting around it by having teleportation gates in his work and i was like laughter okay so not gonna 
faster than light travel just silly but teleportation gates no laughter sc well we have standards for ourselves and 
for other people okay an yeah exactly sc but i love this idea about making it realistic and making 
world that creating realistic both in an economic sense as well as a technological sense after all economics is 
enormous influence on how we live our lives at a very basic level so it led me to the 
conjecture are science fiction writers the last great generalists because of all the stuff you have to know an 
a really interesting question i mean i think really gonna depend on the science fiction writer and also how 
view their relationship to science because i think there is definitely science fiction writers out there maybe people like 
brin for example and i think a lot of writers now passed on who were really popular in the 
i think they really thought of themselves as what we would probably today call a foresight analyst or a 
i think they really did not feel like they were generalists who were commenting on the world today but 
they were actually predicting things that would happen based on what they knew of the world a kind of 
prediction and i think now yeah i mean some science fiction writers for sure are generalists one of the 
breakout new voices in science fiction is ann leckie who won every award in the universe for her series 
yeah i love those an starts with yeah fantastic and i mean she deals with everything she deals with 
she deals with space travel she deals with ai she deals with archaeology and i know from talking to 
that she is a voracious reader and read everything from medieval chinese novels to the latest articles about discoveries 
science so i think she may be an outlier sc there will always be a spectrum right not every 
fiction writer cares that much to do the research and think about these things at an academic level but 
only it seems like if you want to do a certain kind of writing not only do you have 
catch up on humanity and economics and sociology and political science and technology and physics and biology but you 
to be able to tell a story so the humanities are in there too so it does strike me 
the best equipped science fiction writers are true generalists in the old school sense of the word an yeah 
think right and funny the novel that writing right now which be out for a year or so sorry 
kind of teasing it a tiny bit but like autonomous it has a lot of academic in it scientists 
also social scientists and set in an alternate timeline where there is a need for science and social science 
work hand in hand and basically be in the same academic department so this is a very kind of 
fantasy of an alternate sc completely unrealistic yeah i had some teleportation machines in there much more believable an 
know there is time machines so sort of what has to happen right you have to have time machines 
order to have an academic department which is completely integrated social science and science sc right laughter an and 
science geology and so part of what been thinking about a lot in this book is where does social 
fit into the scientific project and i promise that the book is actually just mostly people running around in 
machines and fighting and stuff but sc mostly footnotes like one of these law review articles that has three 
of text at the top and then a hundred lines of footnotes and small an yeah there there will 
laughter there will be an afterword with some end notes but it is but there is this kind for 
like i said you need to go into the novel being like have some thoughts about humanities and the 
some of the characters are social scientists and integral to this scientific project and i was thinking about exactly 
saying was story telling and how what humanities and social sciences bring to science are a sense of history 
also an ability to analyze social data which is increasingly for especially in the realm of technology but also 
a lot of areas of things like infrastructure design and stuff that really does hit up against hard sciences 
hard engineering you know we actually need to understand how humans act over time and what humans have done 
various points pressure points or what they do when they get into a big crowd versus what they do 
they disperse and there are patterns not perfectly reproducible as an ideal scientific experiment would be and very frustrating 
if only we always just acted the same way all the time we could fix a lot of problems 
humanity sc why better to become a physicist than a sociologist way easier to study atoms than people an 
except when all dark matter and magical particles laughter sc very simple really an no laughter sc yeah it 
is compared to any person an is it simple because you just put dark in front of it and 
we use is it dark matter is it dark energy whatever sc no you can literally write down on 
page a model that fits all of the data right can you even imagine doing that with people no 
of course we know exactly what the dark matter is it could be quite complicated but in terms of 
what you see out there in galaxies in the universe the physics you need to imagine the dark matter 
is actually really simple so very happy in telling my students that people with short attention spans should go 
physics rather than the social sciences because you can simplify things way down and the thing still works the 
an yeah i mean i do think there are efforts to do that with the social sciences i think 
theory is a great example of social science trying to reduce all of human interactions to kind of these 
basic laws and wrong in game theory is that it works sometimes in some situations if literally playing a 
or actually i love in the new movie crazy rich asians that game theory becomes an integral part of 
to have a romance which in fact is written into the history of game theory in a way so 
it works in some cases but it certainly explain all the ambiguity sc well to be fair i think 
game theory is just right in terms of its mathematical demonstrations of things but then the question as always 
math is are the assumptions behind these theorems that proven matching on to the situation that you care about 
reality and where game theory or calculus or algebra or anything can leave you wrong certainly extrapolation and regression 
leave you terribly terribly wrong an right yeah and a lot of that i mean it does end up 
down to as saying the fact that individual humans sometimes react in ways that we expec crowds of humans 
react in ways that we expect and you can say okay these we see these general rules if we 
at the long arc of recorded history in the west we can say we see general patterns emerging in 
of how people group together and what kinds of political structures they seem to but a huge variety of 
political structures huge variety of ways that gotten together so hard so tempting to be like gonna come up 
the universal theory of human relationships or of human development in some and tried it karl marx tried to 
it in the century and you know it ever completely work sc well i think we even know why 
work out right i mean the famous example is isaac asimov and psychohistory right he had in mind i 
it was pretty explicit in the novels he had this analogy when you have a bunch of atoms in 
box of gas you can extrapolate general rules for their behavior as a fluid thermodynamics and statistical mechanics so 
course when you get many people you can do the same thing but as a physicist an obvious flaw 
that reasoning which is that in the case of atoms they just simply bump into each other and respond 
a very linear way small things remain small or even get smoothed out wild fluctuations get cancelled out by 
the other fluctuations whereas in a group of human beings who interact very strongly and nonlinearly tiny fluctuations can 
amplified very very strongly sc it is absolutely possible from a physics point of view to understand why groups 
people can be influenced by individuals that have a strong impact on the others an yeah reading a novel 
now called unkindness of by rivers solomon which just came out really great a generation ship novel and so 
in the future because we have generation ships yet and sc what have you believe laughter an yeah sure 
harp is working on it but one of the things great in novel is that she deals with the 
that this generation ship has recreated plantation life and so they have slaves and servants who are living in 
lower decks and doing all the scut work and then they have the plantation owners and it does break 
along familiar racial lines in this book where sort of lighter skinned people on top darker skinned people on 
bottom and this is a great example of of an author trying to play with what talking about where 
tiny or a large fluctuation continues to echo over centuries so been this incredible historical disturbance of the slavery 
africans in the united states and it just go away it the kind of ripples that have propagated out 
that historical trauma just you would hope you would wish that they would just kind of bump into other 
and that those ripples would bump into the obama presidency and be like but it fixed and in fact 
the effects get bigger over time or they return in new ways that are just as pernicious an and 
the fun part of being a writer the sad part of history but the fun part of being a 
is thinking about how there are these social effects that can have very unexpected consequences and also that they 
continue to me writing about the future one of the pleasures of it is i think for some science 
writers the pleasure is coming up with all the new shit like my god gonna have faster than light 
or gonna implant other personalities inside our and to me i was really interested in how would history come 
in some new form and how would we continue to have some of the same struggle which is probably 
why i was excited about talking about economics because i think in one hundred fifty years gonna have gotten 
of capitalism and not gonna science is not magically gonna pay for itself and so i really wanted to 
about how people in the future would still be even though many many things that are different even though 
have hard ai which is a kind of magical dubious thing but they also are still trying to get 
and still struggling with social inequality sc tell us a little bit more about exactly what you imagined economically 
autonomous or in fact tell us about autonomous just a little bit so those have not yet read it 
on you laughter can follow along an so autonomous is about a pharmaceutical pirate she is a former academic 
synthetic biologist and wants to bring medicine to people who are poor or just have any money at all 
have access to it and found that working in academia allowing her to do that too much political stuff 
many corporations that wanna hold on to those drug patents so she becomes a pirate and starts creating versions 
these expensive medicines for free or for very cheap to give to people who afford them and she comes 
the radar of the corporation whose drugs ripping off and they send a couple of agents after her basically 
render her because a couple of other things that trying to cover up that she knows about sc and 
being a euphemism for exterminate an pretty much laughter the corporation worried about her health sc not touchyfeely yeah 
and so the agents who come after her become main characters in the book as well and we switch 
and forth between jack the pirate and paladin the robot who is part of this team of agents chasing 
jack and so the world that in is a world where basically the un has been replaced by a 
that i call the international property coalition so human rights have been superseded by property rights and how people 
of human rights is in the context of property which makes sense because robots are humanequivalent in this world 
they are born indentured to pay off the cost of their manufacture and eventually through some legal shenanigans that 
happened in the past and a tiny info dump where we learn this in the book humans also are 
subject to what they call the rights indenture an so you have the lucky right that if you need 
you can sell yourself to someone and they will own you for a set period of time and of 
a ton of abuses in the system and basically a story about the future of slavery and how do 
reinvent slavery and give it a bunch of euphemisms and a big part of that is the economic system 
one of the large economic coalitions that we see a lot which is a combination of basically north america 
and the us have become this kind of freetrade zone and in order to work or own a house 
go to school in the freetrade zone you have to buy a franchise in a city and when you 
that you pay a certain amount of money to get in and then you pay every year and then 
get free health care you get the right to work and live there you get free schooling you get 
internet emergency services all the things that you would expect to get paid for by the government in our 
well not all of those but many of sc not all of those we dream about them yeah an 
dream about some of those but things like having roads and having access to education and things like that 
think of as just well just what you get of course you have roads part of what you pay 
for at a minimum we also imagine that in our world we think well you should have the right 
work and in this future that right just exist anymore if you wanna work somewhere you have to pay 
so sc and this parallelism for human beings who are allowed to sell themselves into indenture and the ai 
which are automatically there until they can buy their way out am i remembering it correctly an yeah so 
pretty much when all robots are born and these are of course artificially intelligent robots so their consciousness like 
but it is equivalent to a they have feelings and desires and things like that so yeah the law 
that they can be indentured for up to ten years to whoever manufactures them like i said to pay 
the cost of their manufacture and not all robots survive that period of time but if they do then 
are given an autonomy key and are allowed to go be productive members of society and we do get 
see a couple moments of where we meet some robots that have and gotten out of indenture and one 
the things they love to do is just go shopping basically people an like free and so go shopping 
a mall in so the economy a hypercapitalist economy where a lot of the things that we think of 
our rights which have nothing to do with capitalism they just have to do with how the united states 
set up those rights have been taken away like i said the right to work wherever you want the 
to live wherever you want but they have been replaced by new property rights where you can pay to 
where you want and pay to live where you want and so why people get indentured because if you 
enough money to pay to be part of a city or some other community just gonna die unless you 
yourself so those are your choices die or become indentured sc and it reminds us we do take things 
granted right both explicitly and implicitly in our laws we have rights that we label and i was talking 
a law professor on a different episode of the podcast not yet released but about the fact that a 
of things we think should be rights that no one ever thought to put in the constitution because everyone 
that rights right an mmhmm sc and we might even have mentioned the right to work as one of 
but that can be taken away especially if the economic system changes an very true and it was because 
was talking to an economist as i was coming up as i was doing worldbuilding on this that i 
about that because he pointed out sc this is our friend noah smith i bet right an this is 
friend noah smith who is a dedicated dystopian thinker and even though a pretty cheerful sc noahpinion on twitter 
yes notorious twitter personality and he said exactly what saying he was like well we think that we should 
be allowed to live wherever we want but actually a really amazing right to just have that at birth 
lot of civilizations have that and have that so basically i just had to take away some of these 
rights from my characters and suddenly it made perfect sense that people would choose to be indentured and indeed 
in our world now plenty of jobs that people do that are basically indenture well like being a grad 
for example laughter and i was definitely thinking of that i spent many many years as a grad student 
i definitely had a grumpy feeling about my employment situation sc we prefer to indentured servitude laughter an which 
just another way of saying indenture and in fact paying in the university system is you pay in in 
to have the right to work there at least in my experience some people get fancier deals probably but 
point sc you are a humanities graduate student physics graduate students get paid true an yeah we got paid 
little bit laughter and i was kind of on the border with social science so but we yeah it 
was in some ways good that not like science nobody who has to scramble to get money to pay 
sc because no money an no money but the department would try to hand out jobs in a relatively 
way so like one thousand dollars for this semester everybody gets one thousand dollars for the yay laughter sc 
and how did it work in terms of the mechanics of writing the novel going back and forth between 
and storytelling i presume that the worldbuilding influences the story telling but do you have pages and pages of 
worldbuilding materials stuck on your hard drive somewhere an i do have an embarrassingly large amount of worldbuilding materials 
never made it in a lot of stuff i think has to be barely painted in in the background 
readers wanna wade through like a giant info dump where like you know bob in this world how indenture 
and so as you move into the cities this is so really the way the book comes together i 
or came together for me and i think the way novels generally come together for me is it starts 
characters and i start to think about the world that in and then i have to really focus on 
character to write the book and i feel like laying the ground work is the characters what happens to 
how they change or and then i have to come back again at the end and say so what 
the rules of the world i need to smooth this out and make sure everything is consistent otherwise every 
in the universe is gonna be smacking their face as they read this book because just completely laughter incoherent 
terms of how the world sc interesting i think and i noticed this with my wife jennifer who was 
a science an an awesome science writer sc that we an awesome science writer that was implicit we write 
books very differently and guessing that if i were to write a novel i would write it very differently 
that i would have to do all the worldbuilding first and then have to come up with what the 
are doing in that world just like when i write my nonfiction books i start with chapter one and 
chapter two and then chapter three and jennifer can start with chapter seven just like no big deal and 
drives me crazy an i definitely with both my fiction and nonfiction writing i do nonfiction books as well 
have to start with chapter one too and i know people like jennifer who are like but start in 
and i have writer friends who do fiction write a bunch of scenes and then figure out where they 
and sc yeah an drives me crazy i have to i have to know what the world is and 
have to know what i have to start with the characters from the beginning and go to the end 
true when i get to the end i go back to the beginning and clean everything up sc sure 
but yeah i am very linear i guess i live in linear time so i try to honor that 
my work sc and one of the good things about different ways of creating things i remember when we 
a science consult with ridley scott for one of his movies that been made yet he was going to 
the forever war the joe haldeman novel an yeah sc and so there was no script written yet of 
the novel had been written but it was clear that ridley scott had in his mind certain very specific 
all painted out he knew visually what it was going to be like and the words they would appear 
fit whatever you wanted to happen but he knew what it would look like from the start and yet 
way to start with a project like that an yeah and i think for sure like the novel working 
right now which almost done with there were certain scenes that i knew i wanted in there toward the 
and i kept i write them down because i there yet but i was just the other day i 
one of them finally and i was like i finally wrote that and so there is i feel in 
writing people call them and you know where the beats are gonna be and then you kind of write 
into them sc and do sorry let me back up a whole long tradition of scientists diving in and 
the occasional science fiction novel with mixed results shall we say right trained through a lifetime of being an 
to talk and think one way and being a fiction writer is very different now you got your start 
a science writer i guess as a tech writer and then a science writer and then you made the 
into fiction so what was that like were you always planning to write fiction at some point or was 
a huge change of gears an it was a pretty big change of gears i thought i had already 
through the big transition when i moved from writing as an academic to writing popular work writing journalism and 
science and also of course i switched from a humanities focus to looking at tech and science so i 
like done with all my big laughter and yeah it never really works out that way and so making 
transition from academic writing to popular writing i have to say was actually much more difficult in many ways 
transitioning from science nonfiction to science fiction because when writing for an academic audience trying to do so many 
that are very different an not worried about popular or mass appeal you often are buried in a long 
of thought and so having to talk about what everybody else in this field has done my one tiny 
that takes us slightly forward and to the and with pop fiction and nonfiction you have to do as 
of that kind of work part of your job is also just to engage the reader a whole craft 
you have to learn how to be engaging and how to tell a story that people wanna keep reading 
you have to do that sc a craft that so many academics have zero training or interest in learning 
yeah an right but that was actually like a hard transition because one of the freedoms that academic writing 
you is to be as weird and quirky as you want and have a title for your essay some 
play on an poem and the three people that read that article are gonna be like so funny annalee 
sc that was hilarious laughter an and you feel like that was so sophisticated there were ninety levels of 
and like not something you can do in popular in some limited ways you can do that for sure 
i definitely have weird obscure references in my books but that be the whole thing you also have to 
a story that people can relate to and that speaks to a lot of people and not just like 
five people that are interested in marxist cultural studies which is what i was doing sc so you think 
the experience of going through that transition and becoming a popular science writer was extremely helpful for your next 
into fiction an it really was because i had already before i wrote autonomous or actually i should say 
the middle of writing autonomous i wrote a really shitty first draft which i put away and then wrote 
adapt and remember which is a nonfiction science book about mass extinction and how humans will survive the current 
extinction and that book i did a lot of learning about how to structure an arc in a book 
to make it have a beginning middle and end i think i fully succeeded but the failures there helped 
teach me oh so i need to have this kind of connective tissue and sc aristotle was right about 
right this is a reason why someone pointed out that why hollywood movies do well compared to a lot 
foreign films not that hollywood appeal to lowest common denominator but they understand story structure there are acts there 
conflicts that get resolved at the right time and a whole skill to have to learn an yeah a 
part of it and been reading science fiction my whole life and so i definitely have a template in 
head where like this is how you tell a story you do what octavia butler would do or you 
what ursula le guin would there have been many times when thought would octavia butler sc what would octavia 
of course an yeah and she would famous for having spent lots of time with false starts and revision 
writing half a novel and tossing it aside she was very exacting about how to tell a story and 
her stories are so engaging and stick with you for so long so i think i really enjoyed making 
transition i was really surprised that it worked so well and i was even more surprised that people actually 
autonomous i thought it was just gonna be a weird book about robot sex and people would be like 
be like my academic writing four people would be like is the greatest thing and everybody else would be 
book happened i so i was so gratified that my weird ideas and my efforts to make them appeal 
more than just me actually worked sc to be fair there is robot sex there in the book or 
is there robot sex robotonhuman sex an i mean robot sex anytime robots are having sc yeah okay sex 
a robot an anytime robots are having sex is robot sex but yeah and that was part of some 
stuff in this novel as well as of course my exegesis on the future of economics also human relationships 
romance and stuff like that and i think part of what people really liked even though paladin the robot 
some mean things also a really relatable character and just been born in a way just been booted up 
learning not to be a jerk sc well we have to talk about paladin a little bit paladin the 
we talked about the economics and how that goes into the world building also a lot of ideas in 
novel about ai and robots in general and so one of the things you already touched on so i 
wanted to touch on it again certainly sympathetic with paladin discovering herself and sort of a newbie in the 
and an ingenue in discovering things and then she kills people pretty ruthlessly all the time an yeah sc 
like you have to read it twice like did that really just happen was that an intentional kind of 
setting device or how did that come to you an so paladin was the first character that came to 
in the novel so i sort of started with paladin and kind of ended with paladin too when i 
my major revision paladin was the character that changed the most and i felt like i like characters who 
complex and in a gray area and this is a robot that was designed to be a combat robot 
no question why paladin is there is basically just to do some reconnaissance and then do some killing sc 
people part of the job yeah part of the programming an part of the job and part of his 
and he starts out as basically owned by a military branch of the african federation and the african federation 
kinda like the eu for african nations in this future and so a bunch of african nations kind of 
the same currency and things like that so owned by the african federation everyone just kind of assumes a 
because if a big giant bulky terminatorlooking motherfucker you must be a dude and he really care one way 
the other but but sc a robot an gender identity a robot like whatever i really have gender but 
the book goes along and he starts learning more about people and how people relate to each other and 
they think of as being important he starts he wants to change his pronoun so she becomes she in 
middle of the book kind of arbitrarily for a bunch of reasons that i want to spoil and so 
kind of goes through some of the things that a human teenager might go through you know just been 
up questioning the role that been assigned in the world questioning who she is and who she can love 
how she wants humans to perceive her because changing her pronoun of course is all about what humans perceive 
robots really care about gender that much so i wanted people to have this sort of crunchy difficult relationship 
paladin and not have it be just like paladin is an innocent sweet robot you know paladin crushes brains 
job and you know she eventually toward the end is kind of like why am i doing this job 
just kill some more sc brain crushing is that really my purpose yeah laughter an and she never has 
i mean i kind of spoon feed the reader she never has a moment where she kind of scratches 
head and like is meaning of but she does start questioning her programming and given a chance to really 
how been programmed and a really important turning point and again for me this a lot of it was 
about again what like to be a teenager or what like to become a young adult and suddenly you 
that all this stuff doing just because been told that you should do it and just because been told 
and you know lots of people for example grow up with religious programming and they just have never questioned 
and all of a sudden like why am i doing all this stuff do i really believe this how 
how do i wanna be religious do i wanna an and kinda going through something like that with her 
is kind of rethinking all the stuff been taught and so that was so fun to write especially because 
a person who necessarily go into their own mind and be like here i have discovered the programming called 
church and now i can remove because you just do that you remove it if a person but for 
robot she actually can go in eventually and see all the programs running and be like why i was 
that way oh i could modify so robots would be great in therapy what i think laughter sc be 
a very lucrative customer you can just fix them and then they go away not what a therapist wants 
all an yeah but it might be really complex therapist might have essentially like a robot therapist would have 
be basically some kind of programmer or maybe even a hacker have to build little hacks to get around 
you need this program but this program is also telling you to fall in love with guys who are 
bad for you but we wanna keep part of the program but not that other so it could be 
sc well so i have thoughts on this both ways one is provocative to think about an artificially intelligent 
being able to pinpoint programs that give them motivation to do certain things in certain ways because it teaches 
or makes us think something about human beings in some sense robots computers anyway physical organisms things in our 
going on an right sc we might imagine pinpointing there is the part of my brain that makes me 
in love with bad boys who i know will cheat on and would we want to go in there 
pay money to the surgeon to go in there and fix that part of our brain an yeah i 
kind of the question asked in the movie the sunshine of the spotless where a technology i love that 
and sure part of what influenced me and in that movie a technology where you can nuke a set 
memories so that you can forget a mean person in your life or maybe you can forget your lust 
bad boys or whatever so yeah i think that that is a question that these characters have to deal 
for paladin less of a concern because she can see all of the modifications making that said there are 
where having to secondguess the humans around her because she knows that the humans have that same ability and 
she has to say is this person speaking to me out of their programming or do they really mean 
again a very human question because you never know this person just being polite or do they really like 
an and so and so the fun thing with paladin is that while having these very human thoughts i 
based her consciousness on basically a unix system and thought about how early unix computers networked with each other 
what would it be like if you had a consciousness that had kind of grown out of computer networks 
how would these ais communicate with each other and so i have them doing secure handshakes and when they 
each other speaking to each other wirelessly the robots are and kind of announcing themselves in the same way 
data announces itself to a computer on the network where it says here comes my so kind of translating 
what packets are saying as they reach a port and so i felt like i made paladin sufficiently alien 
sufficiently connected to a tradition of computer minds that some of her problems really human problems some of her 
are really network security problems and there is a whole bit where she has she has to deal with 
it means to have a mind that is stored in the cloud and she control that the company that 
her basically owns her backups which is her mind and so a thing that humans really had to deal 
quite yet not in a literal sense anyway sc and i think that this does also raises questions about 
intelligence so i think that the fact that paladin can pinpoint in her brain certain programs that make her 
certain ways provokes us into thinking a certain way about human free will right but on the flip side 
that a little skeptical that artificial intelligence would work as sort of conscious human level ai if you reprogram 
i mean i hear so many conversations about artificial intelligence that are about how we should program the computer 
it do bad things and i really imagine that that would qualify as artificial intelligence if it change its 
in some profound way an i completely agree with you and one of the things said about this book 
and over is that it is science fiction but there is this fantasy at the heart of it which 
that we just sort of wave our hands and have strong ai and ask any questions sc right an 
i think that in real life as we explore more and more what machine learning means and what it 
to build machine learning algorithms into other applications realizing that first of all we know what the hell intelligence 
at all in humans in anything we are totally square one with that and i mean sure a lot 
people who have a lot of different definitions but trying to recreate something that we even quantify in ourselves 
really tough the other thing that i think learning is that intelligence to the extent that it can be 
about is really an ecosystem an different kinds of intelligence and not just talking about dumb stuff like emotional 
which i think whatever a selfhelp book thing i mean kinds of intelligence that work on different kinds of 
intelligence that presents itself as maybe not seeming very intelligent or but actually is brilliant at doing some one 
task or a set of tasks and i think the whole movement around the idea of neurotypicality being actually 
really that typical is really helping us in a way much more than you might think in terms of 
intelligence because once we have an idea that a spectrum of what it means to have consciousness and intelligence 
not just like the one kind of consciousness that we recognize as intelligent and everything other than that is 
autistic or a schizophrenic or whatever the other names are that using at whatever point in history which is 
very abstract way of saying that when we actually if we ever do have something that resembles what gets 
strong ai which is basically human equivalent ai it may actually look nothing like paladin an it may express 
in ways that are really hard for us to relate to it may be like talking to a very 
person and gonna have to learn to translate from those machines and i think some of them might turn 
to be kinda like paladin but i agree with you that if we really wanted to imitate a human 
it would have to be selfmodifying in some way and if it selfmodifying i know if i would say 
be human equivalent but it would be equivalent to a human who had been horribly abused and kind of 
programmed like maybe like a cult victim or something like that someone who been allowed to make any choices 
as a result may be had experienced a huge amount of trauma so if you can sc go ahead 
go ahead laughter sc i was gonna say my own suspicion is my suspicion is that have a hundred 
kinds of artificial intelligence before we have anything that is really like a human being i think that we 
underestimate how hard it is to get something like a human being i think it will happen an obstacle 
principle but many different ways to be intelligent discovering this already way easier to build a computer that will 
at chess than a computer that will carry on a fun conversation with you and part of that is 
not just processing power but also motivations our brains are embodied in our bodies that get hungry and thirsty 
want to reproduce and you wanna sing songs and gonna you could have other motivations for an embodied robot 
they be the same so i would be surprised if the first second third fourth generations of ai were 
like human beings at all an i think as been saying i think gonna be an ecosystem so i 
gonna be some ais whose motivations are incredibly difficult for us to relate to we might know what those 
are but they fit anything we be able to feel those motivations in the same way an ai might 
the other hand if we do assume that we can create a human equivalent ai and program it we 
very well program it to have the same kinds of fucked up desires that humans do right we might 
it what fuco calls a perverse implantation laughter which is just his way of talking about how we sort 
teach people to think that their own desires are terrible and wrong even though we feel them all the 
as you said we live in meat sacks and we have built in urges and needs but using culture 
can try to train people that these urges and needs are bad and can modify them so we can 
how people want to have sex or we can modify how people want to eat why people have so 
weird rituals around sex and food because these are these basic things that we want and culture has just 
all over them and messed them up and made them complex in ways that are infinite just like infinite 
laid on top of like basically just eating and reproducing people laughter an these are not complex activities but 
fetishize them to the point of absurdity and so i think you could imagine a robot that had a 
of hangups martha wells has a great series called murderbot which is a series of novelas which i highly 
where she has a robot who has a lot of social problems and partly due to its programming partly 
to the fact that like paladin kind of a murder a murderbot designed to kill and protect and it 
with all of its problems and all of its hangups by downloading a huge amount of soap operas to 
local memory and then just watching soaps and this very human tic that this robot has an but it 
me think about how we really could through cultural conditioning create ai that are very human and that learn 
life from stories and that crave stories in the same way that people do and so i think like 
said gonna be an ecosystem and gonna be way weirder than we thought i think gonna have a robot 
i think much more like robots and ai and machine learning will kind of merge into human society in 
that are sometimes hard to tell apart from human society if you get an implant kind of an ai 
you kind of become partly ai i think i think gonna end up with a spectrum where totally biological 
intelligence all the way on the other side is like totally machine intelligence and everything in the middle sc 
i think exactly right on your side there did you did you do a lot of conversing with ai 
and robot experts for the novel just like economics an i did yes i talked i talked to hardware 
about how a robot body would be put together because that was something that i know very much about 
read a lot about ai and machine learning i had also already been writing in my journalism a lot 
it and a lot about just computer networks in general i used to when i first started my career 
wrote a lot about computer security and hacking which is actually a great way to learn about computer networking 
all about the ways that subversive activities can take place and people can kind of sneak around all of 
protocols or all of the things that are supposedly safe and so in a way almost like studying computer 
or writing about it almost like looking at computer network neurosis because all about how sc right an like 
thoughts and applications appear in this good pure mind of the computer or mind of your network of computers 
so i had all that stuff in my head and it had been sitting in my head for a 
long time so i was like last i can finally use this knowledge to build a sc so your 
unified theory is that everything we do is a kind of therapy for one thing or another laughter an 
the opposite right that everything we sc everything is a neurosis and all doing is trying to deal with 
neurosis become functionally neurotic an work it out yeah sc whether humans or machine an and just to not 
each other ultimately i think a lot of my work including the novel working on now the big struggle 
just like just kill each other i know mad laughter i know feeling neurotic but just put the gun 
no brain crushing just work it out like grownup robots sc speaking of neurotic you a whole sort of 
another technological angle in autonomous where there are these synthetic drugs being made and then pirated what jack does 
a living and so were you also talking to pharma people and biochemists about how drugs could make you 
or less neurotic or helpful or less an yes i did talk to a lot of very kind and 
biologists i talked to a couple of synthetic biologists i talked to a genetic engineer about the lab scenes 
gave him an early copy of the book and it was really funny because he was like actually the 
scenes are fine and this is all good but you this one machine that you have and a sc 
an as like is everything a fabber laughter that is not how it would work it might have the 
technology but be a bunch of different special use cases and all different kinds of fabbers so that is 
and so i actually did go in and change it so that a lot of things now that used 
be called a fabber have other names cookers and again special use devices that are basically printers but can 
tissue or print various molecular structures and stuff like that so that was really helpful and then i did 
to neuroscientists about the drug that the characters are taking which is getting them addicted to work and and 
was like how the drug would work and what do you and they were like yeah wow that could 
oh so evil yes oh very so they were excited about the evil sc happens all the time i 
when i have done the movie consulting physicists consulting with people making movies is fairly straightforward right like the 
to everything is you need a wormhole to do it but an what you told me when i consulted 
you sc yeah because the truth an it is sc you need a physics consultant you just need an 
chat bot to say you need a wormhole just put the wormhole in there not realistic but you need 
but if you if a writer a producer whatever and you say i need an organism a germ that 
go in and have the following terrible effect on the biologist will go i think oh oh yeah oh 
sure we can do that no and kind of scary from that point of view an yeah and in 
i just outright stole some ideas with permission from some of the biologists i talked to i have a 
final boss fight scene where using a bunch of cool futuristic technology sort of repurposing stuff and the biologist 
was talking to said but you know you do that but you could do this other thing which would 
his skin to erupt with and i was like so anyway not too much of a spoiler but they 
and like pay me to do this this is the best thing ever how could i get a job 
an yeah well i also i always have a warm feeling when a scientist tells me that something is 
even if sort of saying a caveat that of course not laughter and like when you told me about 
i was like i can use wormholes sean said okay even though he said also wormholes really exist but 
said they could kinda maybe possibly laughter sc not gonna exist there are different levels an ecosystem of violating 
laws of physics so acceptable ones and less acceptable ones an yeah yeah exactly i think the thing most 
to me when representing science is trying to represent the scientific process accurately which is to sc sure an 
people testing things and retesting them and how do you test things i have a character testing photonic molecule 
which is not a thing there is not photonic molecules but you would in fact have to go test 
levels on a device over and over to kind of make the suppositions that she does so i wanted 
least to be honest in that way so that people understand that science is actually a lot of dreary 
and not a lot of gazing rapturously into glowing holes and saying full of sc allow some absurdity but 
want our absurdities to be grounded in the scientific method as much as possible an exactly sc and how 
of the discussion of the intersection between economics and pharma in the book was a commentary of reflection or 
by the real world right now an inspired by the real world i mean i live in the real 
maybe to my detriment and so everything i write about my brain takes it in and i either consciously 
probably a lot of times unconsciously kinda smoosh it up and try to rethink it and put it on 
page so like a lot of people in the united states had many friends that suffered horribly because they 
medical treatments and so that was very much on my mind and pharma companies are huge a huge business 
poorly understood and the way that they make money overlaps a lot with the patent system which is also 
understood and so a great way to just rip people off and you always have a captive audience gonna 
no to a drug gonna cure them or prolong their life so in some ways an easy target for 
big bad but also a source of great anxiety and pain for lots of people so it seemed like 
obvious place to poke and who want a pharmaceutical pirate the best pirate sc well i was gonna say 
protagonist is a biochemical pharmaceutical pirate so pretty good an yeah i and funny after the novel came out 
few people have come out identifying as pharmaceutical pirates and so i was excited about that i was like 
from the rich give to the my hope is inspire that sc it is closer to the robin hood 
real piracy right i mean real pirates are in it for themselves an yes character is very much like 
the robin hood tradition i was explicitly thinking about robin hood who is like one of my very favorite 
characters ever sc and so why you just give us a teaser for the next one are i should 
are you mostly a fiction writer now or still writing nonfiction also an i am trying to be bi 
is hard nobody really acknowledges these bitextual people like me but i am working on two books right now 
of which is nonfiction which is about ancient abandoned cities focusing on four cities specifically and looking at why 
abandoned them even though they were kind of cities that were at the heart of their civilizations and sort 
using that to think about the modern world and what gonna do with our mega cities and also working 
a novel which is about time travelling geologists so great to be working on something about ancient history while 
writing about time travel whenever i feel the need like desperately as writing about archeology like wish i could 
go back and find out what really like will go over to my novel where all they have to 
is get a grant to use the time machine in order to go back and find out what so 
a really fun past year although very stressful because trying to write a lot of stuff but the novel 
be out next fall and the nonfiction book will probably be out in sc yeah i think a kind 
a theme here i wanna sort of force a theme where not there but written about how going to 
an apocalypse sorry what was the title of that book again an scatter adapt and remember sc right an 
we will survive a mass extinction sc yes and it depends on the mass extinction right an very much 
a lot of instructions in the book sc yeah and now you have the book on ancient cities where 
it spoiler alert i suppose but is it mostly that they chose to leave them or were they forced 
leave them for some reason or another an always a combination these were cities that were abandoned which means 
people left them they forced out by invading forces in any of the cases looking at in one case 
with pompeii the city was buried in ash but other cities that were buried in ash at that same 
were dug out like naples which was affected as well but pompeii was not and so looking at what 
the precipitating factors that turn a huge city like say anchor which had a million people about years ago 
made it the biggest city on earth at that time how did that go from the biggest city on 
and then within four hundred years to just a few monks living in kind of ruined remains sc can 
blame neurosis for this an you know i mean the neurosis that once you get a bunch of humans 
in a city the neurosis become things like historical trauma and also infrastructure upkeep that turns out to be 
big issue politics are a huge part of what causes a city to fail but politics alone do it 
got to be combined with some kind of environmental problem whether the problem is actually climate change or mismanaging 
water supply or whatever so i know if a neurosis or but it is certainly a recurring human problem 
yeah an we see it over and over again sc so scatter adapt and remember that was the title 
the title of my first book and the nonfiction book working on now about abandoned cities is just called 
lost cities sc but i like scatter adapt and remember is kind of the theme right running through the 
as well as the nonfiction human beings trying to adapt to challenging circumstances and choosing different modes of doing 
an very true for me in all of my work i have a strong wish to urge people to 
and try to survive in a way that helps lots of other people survive with them i mean i 
joking earlier about the whole goal with my fiction is just to tell people not to kill each other 
not killing rule one an kill number one and part a joke but also that is part of what 
to do in my nonfiction is kind of show people ways that humans have survived and how even when 
circumstances kick them out of a really awesome city they still manage to survive their culture lives on humans 
on and we create new social structures that are hopefully a little bit less inclined to encourage people to 
each other sc yeah an the goal just like less and less pressure to kill laughter more and more 
to take care of everyone so yeah survival survival in style i would say sc survival in style is 
i did notice in one interview someone wanted to paint autonomous as a dystopian novel but you said just 
topia neither a dystopia nor a utopia the usual in between somewhere an yeah just how things are now 
things are a little worse sometimes a little better for certain groups of people but yeah i mean definitely 
a lot of things that happen that yeah positive great medicine available if you can afford it so you 
need a pirate to help make that a better system and certainly in the time travel novel working on 
some bad stuff but some good stuff all balanced out sc well you write a novel where happy and 
sitting around saying how happy they are but maybe the descriptions of less than perfect situations can help nudge 
here in the real world towards making things a little bit better an i think true and i think 
gonna reach a point as a civilization or a species where happy all the time even if we have 
awesome genie coefficient and we have an extreme division between rich and poor and we have massive social injustice 
gonna argue still gonna have jealousy sc oh yeah an still gonna be sad when someone dies or someone 
us always gonna be drama and sadness just that hopefully we can keep it on a kind keep it 
keep it limited back to my point about not killing sc i like that i an just have interpersonal 
and not have wars sc i think a perfect note to end on annalee newitz thanks so much for 
on the podcast an yeah thank you for having me music i would appreciate it if you sean would 
along to annalee this link to learn about an actual case of a young kazakhstani scientist who is a 
hoodish theft pirate who is taking on the multibillion dollar industry that traps knowledge behind paywalls pirate webscraper service 
has done more than any government to tackle one of the biggest ripoffs of the modern era the capture 
research that should belong to i think you and she and your listeners might find it valuable after listening 
this great podcast re older generation of sf isaac asimov and harlan ellison were two of the great polymaths 
renowned for their vast knowledge base just trying to be helpful honoring the history would it be possible to
