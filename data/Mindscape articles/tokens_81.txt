he and david bourget founded the philpapers project click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome 
the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll if any of you have read the big picture my most recent 
you know that one of the things we have to think about if naturalists trying to come to terms 
the world of our experience is the phenomenon of consciousness actually most of you probably know that even if 
read that book a pretty well known fact the question of course is is demanded of us by the 
of can we simply hope to explain consciousness using the same tools we explain other things with atoms and 
moving according to the laws of physics according to standard model and the core theory or do we need 
else somehow that helps us explain what consciousness is and how it came about so someone who thinks we 
anything else i think just understanding the motion and interactions of physical stuff from which consciousness emerges as a 
level phenomenon sc our guest today is david chalmers probably the most well known and respectable representative of the 
side of the people who think that you need something beyond just the laws of physics as we currently 
them to account for consciousness david is the philosopher who coined that the term hard problem of the idea 
that the easy problems are how you look at things and why you react in certain ways how you 
math problems in your head the hard problem being our personal experience what it is like to be you 
me rather than somebody else the first person subjective experience the hard problem and someone like me thinks yeah 
there just a matter of words and understanding and someone like david thinks we need a real change in 
underlying way of looking at the world so he describes himself as a naturalist someone who believes in just 
natural world no supernatural world not a dualist who thinks our disembodied mind or anything like that but not 
physicalist he thinks that the natural world has not only natural properties not only physical properties but mental properties 
well sc so i would characterize him as convinced of the problem but not wedded to any particular answer 
chalmers is a philosopher who everyone respects even if they agree with him a delight to talk to because 
is very openminded about considering different things like i said convinced of this problem but when it comes to 
the problem he will propose solutions but he take them too dogmatically he will change his mind when good 
comes along so a great person to talk to about this very very important problem for naturalists when they 
to confront how to understand what it means to be a human being and where consciousness comes from also 
has developed a recent interest in the simulation hypothesis the idea that maybe we could all be living in 
simulation running on a computer owned by a very very advanced civilization in a completely different reality sc so 
about the hard problem of consciousness talk about various philosophical issues and i pin him down on anything not 
to argue with him my point here is not to convince david chalmers in real time that wrong but 
to let you the listeners hear what his perspective is on these issues and then hear what my perspective 
on these issues and decide for yourself maybe you will change your mind either right now or sometime down 
road so this is a fun conversation sure like it and go music sc david chalmers welcome to the 
podcast david chalmers thanks great to be here sc so discovered in my brief history of having philosophers on 
podcast that a lot to say that we have a lot of ground to cover i know that you 
have all sorts of interests just jump right in to the crowdpleasing things that we can talk about one 
the experts on the philosophy of consciousness i believe the one who coined the phrase hard problem of so 
would you define what the hard problem is dc the hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining 
physical processes in the brain somehow give rise to subjective experience so when you think about the mind a 
a lot of things that need to be explained some of them involve our sophisticated behavior all the things 
can do we can get around we can walk we can talk we can communicate with each other we 
solve scientific problems but a lot of that is at the level of sophisticated behavioral capacities things we can 
when it comes to explaining behavior got a pretty good bead on how to explain it in principle at 
you find that circuit in the brain a complex neural system which maybe performs some computations produces some outputs 
the behavior then in principle got an explanation it may take a century or two to work out the 
but roughly the standard model in cognitive science sc and wrapped this together as the easy problem dc yeah 
this is what years ago i called the easy sc slightly tongue in cheek dc of the mind and 
consciousness in particular roughly referring to these behavioral problems nobody thinks easy in the ordinary sense the sense in 
easy is that we know got a paradigm for explaining them find the neural mechanism or a computational mechanism 
kind of thing that could produce that behavior in principle find the right one tell the right story have 
explanation but when it comes to consciousness to subjective experience it looks as if that method so obviously apply 
are some aspects of consciousness which are roughly speaking behavioral or functional and you could use the word consciousness 
the difference between being awake and responsive for example versus being asleep or maybe just for the ability to 
about certain things dc i can talk about the fact that sean carroll there are some books over there 
hearing my and those are some reports explaining those reports might also be an easy problem but the really 
problem of consciousness is posed not by the behavioral parts but by the subjective experience by how it feels 
the inside to be a conscious being seeing you right now i have a visual image of colors and 
that are sort of present to me as an element in the inner movie of the mind hearing my 
feeling my body got a stream of thoughts running through my head and the hub and this is what 
call consciousness or subjective experience and i take it to be one of the fundamental facts about ourselves that 
have this kind of subjective experience but then the question is how do you explain it and the reason 
we call it the hard problem is it looks like the standard method of just explaining behaviors and explaining 
things we do quite come to grips with the question of why is there subjective experience it seems you 
explain all of these things we do the walking the talking the reports the reasoning and so why all 
go on in the dark why do we need subjective experience the hard problem sc so sometimes i hear 
glossed as the question of what it is like to be a subjective agent to be a person dc 
good definition of consciousness actually first put forward or at least made famous by my colleague tom nagel here 
nyu in an article back in one thousand nine hundred seventyfour called what is it like to be a 
and his thought was we know what like to be a bat we know what a subjective experience is 
got this weird sonar perceptual capacity which really correspond directly to anything that humans but presumably there is something 
to be a bat a bat is conscious most people would say on the other hand nothing like to 
a glass of so if right then a glass of water is not conscious so this way of speaking 
a good way at least of serving as an initial intuition term for what is the basic difference getting 
between systems which are conscious and systems which are not sc and the other word that is sometimes invoked 
this context is qualia the experiences that we have like one thing that it is to see the color 
and a separate thing if i get it right to have the experience of the redness of red dc 
this word my sense is it has gone a little bit out of favor over the last say years 
maybe twenty years ago you had a lot of people speaking of qualia as a word for the sensory 
that you come across in experience and the paradigmatic ones would be the experience of red versus the experience 
green you can raise all these familiar questions about this do i know that my experience of the things 
call red is the maybe the same as the experience you have when you are confronted with the things 
call green maybe your internal experiences are swapped with respect to and people call that inverted qualia that would 
red is my or pain would be another example of the singular in latin is quale dc so the 
of pain would be a quale not sure that these qualities are all there is though to consciousness and 
one reason why gone out of favor also maybe an experience to thinking to reasoning and to feeling much 
to pin down in terms of sensory qualities but you might think something like to think and to reason 
though not the same as what like to sense sc i wanna just for a little bit talk about 
question of whether or not you and i have the same experience when we see the color red not 
i know what that could possibly mean for it to be either the same experience or a different experience 
mean one is going on in my head one is going on in your head in what sense could 
be the same but maybe when i say that just a reflection of the fact that a hard problem 
well we know that some people for to pick a much easier case some people are colorblind they even 
a distinction between red and green you know most people have a redgreen axis for color vision and a 
axis and something like a brightness axis but some people due to things going wrong in their retinal mechanisms 
make the distinction between red and green so i got friends who are redgreen colorblind often asking them is 
like to be dc it like you just see everything in shades of blue and yellow and you get 
reds and greens or is it something different but we know what like to be them be the same 
what like to be us for example reds and greens which are different for us are the same for 
so got to be some difference between us as a matter of logic my red be the same as 
red and my green be the same if my red was the same as their red and my green 
the same as their green and their red was the we know their red is the same as their 
my red be different from my green but it is sc but it is dc as a matter of 
there has to be some difference there sc but so one way out is well everybody who is different 
everybody else their experiences are different i guess the question then is in what sense could they ever be 
same what is the meaningfulness and i can imagine some kind of operational sameness right like you say the 
red when you see the word red in that behavioral sense but exactly what you wanna count dc yeah 
i guess intuitively most people think that we can at least grasp the idea that my red is the 
as your red and then an empirical open question but they are in fact exactly the same i mean 
it is unfair how you can operationalize that now you might say a scientist i want an operational on 
other hand a philosopher and very skeptical of the idea that you can operationalize everything that a hypothesis has 
to be operationalizable to be meaningful i mean there was a movement in philosophy in the first part of 
century logical positivism or logical empiricism where they said only meaningful hypotheses are the ones we can and for 
reasons that turned out to have a lot of problems not least because this very philosophical hypothesis of verificationism 
out not to be one that you could test sc a renaissance of logical positivism on philosophy twitter these 
dc oh is that right sc yeah dc rudolf carnap who was one of the great logical positivists is 
of my heroes written a whole book called constructing the world that was partly based around some of his 
nonetheless verificationism is not one of the ones and i think when it comes to consciousness in particular dealing 
something essentially subjective i know conscious not because i measured my behavior or anybody behavior because something i experience 
from the first person point of view i think probably conscious but not as if i can give a 
out operational definition of it if you say conscious then conscious like to say that most people think that 
settle the question maybe come up with an ai that says conscious and okay well that would be very 
but would it settle the question of whether having a subjective experience probably not sc well so alan turing 
right the turing test was supposed to be a way to judge conscious from not what are your feelings 
the success of that program dc i think not a i mean of course no machine right now is 
close to passing the turing sc you might as well say what the turing test is dc yeah so 
turing test is the idea basically a test to see whether a machine can behave in a manner indistinguishable 
a normal human being at least in a verbal conversation over say text messaging and the like and turing 
that eventually have machines that pass this test that is indistinguishable from say another human interlocutor over hours of 
testing then he say at that point then machines can think what he said was at that point the 
of whether machines can think becomes basically meaningless and provided an operational definition to substitute for it so once 
pass this test he says good enough for sc yeah he talked in the paper about the consciousness objection 
might say that just mimicking consciousness but not really conscious and as i recall his response is who cares 
possibly test that therefore not dc but it turns out that consciousness is one of the things that we 
a one of the central properties of our minds and many of us think what actually gives our gives 
lives meaning and value if we conscious if we have subjective experience then basically just be automata for whom 
has any meaning or value so i think when it comes to the once we develop more and more 
ais the question of whether conscious is gonna be absolutely central to how we treat them to whether they 
moral status whether we should care whether they continue to live or die whether they get rights and i 
many people think if not having subjective experiences and basically machines that we can treat the way we treat 
but if having conscious experiences like ours then it would be horrific to treat them the way we currently 
machines so yeah i mean if you just simply operationalize all those questions then a danger i think that 
lose the things that you the things that we really care about sc and just so we can get 
sort of background assumptions on the table here for the most part neither you or i are coming from 
strictly dualist perspective not trying to explain consciousness in terms of a descartean disembodied immaterial mind that is a 
substance right i mean we want to at least as the first hypothesis say that you and i are 
of atoms obeying the laws of physics and that consciousness is somehow related to that but not an entirely 
category interacting with us is that right is that fair dc yeah although different kinds and different degrees of 
my background is very much in mathematics and computer science and physics and all of my instincts my first 
are materialist to try to explain everything in terms ultimately in terms of the processes of physics i mean 
biology in terms of chemistry and chemistry in terms of physics and this is a wonderful great chain of 
but i do think when it comes to consciousness this is the one place where that great chain of 
seems to break down roughly because when it comes to biology and chemistry and all these other fields the 
that need explaining are all basically these easy problems of structure and dynamics and ultimately the behaviors of these 
dc when it comes to consciousness we seem to have something different that needs explaining and i think that 
standard kinds of explanation say that you get out of physics derived sciences physics chemistry biology and neuroscience and 
on just ultimately add up to an explanation of subjective experience because it always leaves open this further question 
all that sophisticated processing accompanied by consciousness by a subjective that mean though we suddenly need to say all 
of say a soul or some religious thing which has existed since the beginning of time and will go 
to continue after our death people sometimes call that substance dualism maybe a whole separate substance the mental substance 
somehow interacts connects up with our physical bodies and interacts with it dc that view is much harder to 
to a scientific view of the world but the direction i end up going is what people sometimes call 
dualism the idea that there are some extra properties of things in the universe i mean this is something 
to in physics already people maybe around the time of maxwell we had physical theories that took space and 
and mass as fundamental and then maxwell wanted to explain electromagnetism and there was a project of trying to 
it in terms of space and time and mass so no turns out it quite work you explain it 
and eventually we ended up positing charge as a fundamental property and some new laws governing electromagnetic phenomena and 
was just an extra property in our scientific picture of the world dc so inclined to think that something 
exactly analogous to that but at least analogous to that in some respects is what we have to do 
consciousness as well basically explanations in terms of space and time and mass and charge and whatever the fundamentals 
in physics these days are not gonna add up to an explanation of consciousness so we need another fundamental 
in there as well and one working hypothesis is take consciousness as an irreducible element of the world and 
see if we can come up with a scientific explanation of sc good i think this i mean we 
absolutely be open to that i go down that road myself i find it very convincing but maybe in 
next fortyfive minutes convince me so i do wanna get there but lay a little bit more ground work 
so one of the things a lot of the statements gonna be making over the course of the chat 
of the form think this is right correct me if so i think one of the things that makes 
hard problem hard is just the fact that you even imagine looking at neurons doing something and saying that 
is that fair to say dc yeah i would say that what when you appeal to neural activity in 
phenomena a paradigmatic way that works we see how those neurons serve as a mechanism for performing some function 
generating some behavior that is the paradigmatic appeal to neurobiology in explanation and it just looks like any explanation 
that form is not gonna add up to an explanation of consciousness it explains the wrong thing it will 
behavior but those were the easy problems explaining consciousness was something distinct the hard problem sc so you think 
even and very far away from this but even if neuroscientists got to the point where for every time 
a person was doing something we would all recognize as having a conscious experience even if it was silent 
the redness of red they could point to exactly the same neural activity going on in the brain you 
say but this still explain my subjective dc yeah in fact a very important research program is going on 
now in neuroscience and people call it the program of funding neural correlates of consciousness the ncc for short 
to find the ncc that neural system or systems is active precisely when conscious and that correlates perfectly with 
to which i say a very very important research program but really as it stands a program for correlation 
for explanation so we could know that say when a certain special kind of neuron fires in a certain 
that that neural pattern always goes along with consciousness but then the next question then is why explain that 
why is it that this pattern gives you consciousness dc and as it stands nothing that we get out 
the neural correlates of consciousness program in neuroscience comes close to explaining that matter and i think a lot 
people once they start to think about this think you basically need some further fundamental principle that connects the 
correlate of consciousness with consciousness giulio tononi has developed a theory integrated information theory where he says consciousness goes 
with a certain mathematical measure of the integration of information that he calls phi and the more phi you 
the more consciousness you have and phi is a mathematically and physically a respectable quantity very hard to measure 
in sc but you can define it dc it could be measured questions about whether actually welldefined in terms 
the details of physics and physical systems but at least halfway to being something definable but even if right 
phi this informational property of the brain correlates perfectly with consciousness still the question of why prima facie it 
like you could have had a universe with all of this integration of information going on and no consciousness 
all and yet in our universe consciousness how do we explain that fact well i think that what i 
as the scientific thing to do at this point is to say well we boil in science we boil 
down to fundamental principles and fundamental laws and if we need to postulate a fundamental law to connect say 
with consciousness then great and then maybe gonna end up being the best we can dc just as in 
in physics you always end up with some fundamental laws whether a principle of gravitation or a grand unified 
that unifies all these different forces you still end up with some fundamental principles and you explain them further 
has to be taken as basic and the question of course we want to minimize our fundamental principles and 
our fundamental properties as far as we can but razor says multiply entities without every now and then necessity 
had necessity and if right necessity in this case too sc and you hinted you sort of alluded to 
idea that is one of your most famous philosophical thought experiments just there where you say can imagine a 
with whatever thought you want but we call it so you take this idea to the extreme and say 
be something that looks and acts just like a person but have dc so this is the thought experiment 
the zombie the zombie is somewhat different from the ones you find in hollywood movies or in haitian voodoo 
the ones in voodoo culture as far as i can tell are mostly beings that have been given some 
people have been given some kind of poison somehow seem to be lacking autonomy volition a certain kind of 
will the ones in hollywood movies are beings which are a lot like us but dead and reanimated sc 
and they want brains dc the zombie is a creature which is exactly like us functionally and maybe physically 
conscious now very important to say nobody certainly not me is arguing that zombies actually exist that for example 
human beings around us are zombies actually i did once meet a philosopher laughter in dublin who was very 
that quite a lot of philosophers actually were zombies they conscious at all i was a little bit insulted 
this he seemed to be worried about me he took me to laughter sc that might explain a lot 
dc yeah yeah he took me to lunch and he asked me a whole lot of questions about consciousness 
at sc your inner experiences dc yeah yeah and at the end he said you pass i think sc 
but a zombie could also pass right dc exactly sc so is it right to say that a yeah 
think finished your definition yet dc yeah sc but a zombie would be behaviorally the same dc yeah behaviorally 
same but no conscious experience nothing like to be a zombie maybe a good way to work up to 
is by thinking about say some sophisticated artificial intelligence system that produces lots of intelligent responses maybe it talks 
you maybe an extension of alexa or siri who carries on a very sophisticated conversation with us but most 
us are not inclined to think that say alexa and siri as they stand are conscious that having subjective 
dc okay now put alexa in a body like sophia the robot a robot out there with a very 
conversational system make her smarter and smarter then at least an open question is she going to be conscious 
we can make sense of the hypothesis that conscious we can also make sense of the hypothesis that not 
not the extreme case is gonna be a complete physical and functional duplicate of a human being with all 
brain processing intact all of the behavior maybe even a complete physical duplicate of sean carroll and i think 
can make sense of the hypothesis when i talk to you that be such a being not conscious zombie 
carroll now very confident that not zombie sean carroll i think most human beings are enough like me that 
be conscious but the point is it at least seems logically possible it seems no contradiction in the idea 
a being physically just like you without consciousness and just one way of getting at the idea that somehow 
you do have consciousness then something special and extra has to be going on so i mean you can 
put the hard problem of consciousness as the problem of why we zombies what differentiates us from zombies sc 
and with some trepidation let me ask the question how the difference between possible and conceivable comes into the 
argument dc yeah philosophers like to talk about possible worlds what goes on in different possible worlds and a 
world where hillary clinton won the election in and there are possible worlds where the second world war never 
these are all maybe not terribly distinct possible worlds they might for example share roughly the same laws of 
as ours maybe small differences in the initial conditions some of us think we can also make sense of 
with different laws of physics and different laws of nature maybe there are classical possible worlds maybe there are 
worlds that are twodimensional like game of life of just bits fluttering on a surface governed by simple rules 
yeah there are very distant possible worlds with very different laws of nature dc the broadest class is maybe 
like the logically possible world it corresponds roughly to what we can conceive of or what we can imagine 
there are even worlds that we imagine like worlds where two plus two is five getting a bit too 
even things really start to go haywire around that point but as long as we have contradictions then we 
at least entertain possible worlds inclined to think the zombie hypothesis looks to me perfectly coherent and perfectly conceivable 
is a universe which is physically identical to ours but in which nobody has subjective experience an entire zombie 
if you like conscious experience never flickers into existence just a whole bunch of sophisticated behavior i think our 
is like that but it seems to make sense and one way to pose the hard problem is saying 
differentiates our world from that world sc so where i come down here is i think that zombies are 
and very happy to be talked out of this i think i talked to you a couple of years 
before i wrote the big picture and i was not quite as sharp in my thoughts about this so 
you just said we could imagine a literal physical copy of our world so that includes all the people 
it all the atoms that made of and you do think that as far as we know the atoms 
my body just obey the laws of physics as we know them right so in that world i would 
here in that world but without consciousness without experience i would be here be a zombie but i would 
acting and saying exactly the same things that acting and saying now is that right dc yup sc okay 
so if you in that world were to ask me if i were conscious i would say yes dc 
sc and presumably there is a sensible way in which i could i say yes because i believe it 
be true is that fair dc yeah a complicated issue whether zombies actually believe sc at the least dc 
got zombie analogs of beliefs at the very least sc so i mean the most basic way to put 
then is how can i be sure that not a zombie if all of the things that i say 
do are exactly what a zombie would say and do dc well i think this is a very good 
that i be sure that not a zombie because all i have access to with respect to you is 
behavior and your functioning and so on and none of that seems to absolutely differentiate you from a zombie 
think the first person case is different because in the first person case conscious i know that conscious i 
that more directly than i know anything else i mean descartes said way back in the this is the 
thing i can be certain of i can doubt everything about the external world i can i can doubt 
table here i can doubt a body one thing i doubt that thinking or i think he put it 
better he said that conscious i think therefore i am so therefore i i doubt my own existence so 
would i think natural to take consciousness as our primary epistemic datum so whatever you say about zombies and 
on i know that not one of them because i know that conscious sc but my worry about exactly 
is so like you said my argument certainly would make you wonder whether i am conscious i think it 
makes me wonder whether conscious because i think that the zombie me because a zombie me would behave in 
the same way it includes writing all the bad poetry i wrote in high school and crying at movies 
walle and so forth and petting my cats like all of these things the zombie would do in exactly 
same way that i do if you ask that zombie me you it would say and it would give 
reasons i see how i can be sure that not that zombie dc i think to be fair this 
your finger on i think the weakest spot for the zombie hypothesis and for ideas that come from it 
my first book the conscious mind came out about twenty years ago i had a whole chapter on this 
i called the paradox of phenomenal judgment that basically stems from the fact that my zombie twin in that 
next door is going around doing exactly the same things that doing and saying the same things that saying 
even writing a word for word identical book called the conscious mind arguing that consciousness is irreducible to physical 
and say well and i mean a lot of strange things go on in possible worlds we take them 
seriously dc but say that yeah in the zombie universe the right view is what philosophers call eliminativism that 
is no such thing as consciousness the zombie is in fact making a mistake and i think there is 
respectable program about consciousness in our world that says basically in the situation of the zombie and lately just 
the last two or three years actually been a bit of an upsurge of people really thinking seriously about 
view which has come to be known as illusionism the idea that consciousness is some kind of internal introspective 
dc after all think about going on with the zombie the zombie thinks it has special properties of consciousness 
it all is dark inside so then say actually our laughter like it seems to us that we have 
these special properties those qualia those sensory experiences but not all is in a way dark inside for us 
well but just a very strong introspective mechanism that makes us think we have these special properties illusionism dc 
most people find it impossible to believe that consciousness is an illusion in that way on the other hand 
view does have the advantage of predicting that you would find it impossible laughter to believe if a good 
mechanism that makes you focus on this so actually lately been thinking about this a lot i wrote an 
called the metaproblem of consciousness just come out in the journal of consciousness studies the hard problem of consciousness 
why are we conscious how do physical processes give rise to consciousness the metaproblem of consciousness is why do 
think conscious and why do we think there is a problem of consciousness and the great thing about the 
is remember the the easy problems were about behavior the hard problems about experience well the metaproblem is a 
ultimately about behavior dc about the things we say and things we do why do i why do people 
around writing books about this why do they say conscious feeling pain why do they say have these properties 
are hard to explain in functional a behavioral problem an easy problem maybe ultimately be a mechanistic explanation of 
and that would of course be potential grist for the mill once you have the mechanisms to explain why 
say all these things in physical terms you could then try and turn that around with an explanation you 
then call that solution to the metaproblem an explanation of the illusion of consciousness some people will still find 
unbelievable but again the view predicts that sc and if i wanted to know why i feel puzzled by 
hard problem of consciousness is that the meta metaproblem of consciousness dc oh i think that maybe still the 
sc okay laughter dc yeah why you find consciousness puzzling is certainly one central aspect to the metaproblem there 
all these things that we seem to feel and say red could be your green i can imagine zombies 
seem those are all behaviors explain those behaviors and maybe explained at least the higher order judgments about consciousness 
my own view is that that even that add up to an explanation of consciousness but i think at 
very least understanding those mechanisms might tell us something very very interesting about the basis of consciousness so been 
this as a research program a neutral research program for everyone philosophers scientists and sc neutral in the sense 
presuming any conclusion about what the answer will be dc exactly you be materialist you be dualist you be 
you this is just basically an empirical research program here are some facts about human behavior try and explain 
furthermore philosophers psychologists neuroscientists ai researchers could all in principle get in on this and i think gradually a 
gonna be a target article a symposium in journal of consciousness studies with a whole bunch of people from 
those fields getting in on it so hoping this at least turns out to be a productive way to 
with the question of course it be neutral forever eventually have some stuff and then some results and some 
and then the argument will continue to rage between people who think the whole an illusion and the whole 
sc we should say though that aside from eliminativism and illusionism which are fairly sort of hardcore on one 
or forms of dualism which could be on the other side there is this kind of emergent position that 
can take this is the one i wanna take in the big picture and so forth which is physicalist 
materialist at the bottom but say that therefore things like consciousness and our subjective experiences exist or are illusions 
higher order of phenomena like tables and chairs categories that we invent to help us organize our experience of 
world dc yeah my view is that emergence is sometimes used as kind of a magic word to make 
feel good about things that we understand laughter do you get from this to but what really do you 
by emergent i think i wrote an article on emergence where i distinguished weak emergence from strong emergence weak 
is basically the kind you get from lowlevel structure dynamics explaining higher level structure dynamics of behavior of a 
system traffic flows in a city the dynamics of a hurricane you get all kinds of strange and surprising 
cool phenomena emerging at the higher level but still ultimately once you understand the lowlevel mechanisms well enough the 
ones just follow transparently just lowlevel structure giving you highlevel structure according to the following of certain simple lowlevel 
sc you could put it on a computer and simulate it dc exactly but when it comes to consciousness 
looks well when it comes to the easy problems of consciousness those may well turn out to be emergent 
just this way they may turn out to be lowlevel structural functional mechanisms that produce these reports and these 
and lead to systems sometimes being awake and no one would be surprised if these were weakly emergent in 
way but none of that seems to add up to an explanation of subjective experience which just looks like 
fundamentally new this philosophers sometimes talk about emergence in a different way as strong emergence which actually involves something 
new emerging via new fundamental laws dc maybe a fundamental law it says you get this information being integrated 
you get i think consciousness may be emergent in that sense but not a sense that ought to help 
materialist i think if you want consciousness to be emergent in a sense that helps the materialist you have 
go through weak emergence and ultimately going to require reducing the hard problem to an easy problem so i 
everyone has to make hard choices here i wanna let you off the hook of just saying all ultimately 
be the brain and a bunch of dc a respectable materialist research program here but it has to involve 
turning into the hard problem all gonna get out of physics is ultimately more and more structure and dynamics 
functioning and so on so for that to turn into an explanation of consciousness you need to find some 
to deflate what needs explaining in the case of consciousness ultimately turning the hard problem into an easy problem 
a matter of behavior and a matter of functioning and maybe say that extra thing that seems to need 
an illusion and people like dan dennett i respect greatly has tried to do this for years for decades 
his research program at the end of the day most people look at what come up and they say 
good enough laughter you explained if you can do better then great sc whereas to move more in the 
of what positively advocating for at i mean always been very careful to positively advocate for not that much 
is as you say a hard problem we know the answers yet we need to move forward by insisting 
must be the right answer so been openminded but at least openminded about this property dualism that you talked 
and that one version of that leads us into panpsychism so can you explain these two concepts dc yes 
say that explored a number of different positive views on consciousness what i done is committed to any of 
i see various different interesting possibilities each of which has big problems has big attractions but also big problems 
overcome so tried to explore some of those one at a time one of the possibilities is panpsychism the 
that consciousness goes right down to the bottom of the natural order panpsychism means all means mind so basically 
everything has a mind taken literally it would imply that people have minds particles have minds but also tables 
numbers have minds sc sorry do we have to say have minds or can we just get away with 
something like have mental properties as well as physical ones dc yeah if that makes you feel better sc 
might make me feel a little bit better yeah dc have experiences we can say something like to be 
sc well i know i mean do we want to say an electron has experiences dc well i think 
taken literally has that consequence by the way most panpsychists say that tables or rocks or numbers have minds 
typically their biggest commitment is to fundamental physical entities have a mind sc okay dc so if you want 
say now a weaker view you might wanna say actually something like to be an electron an electron have 
it merely has some protoversion of experience some predecessor of experience maybe electrons are protoconscious then a view called 
that could maybe seem a little bit less insane to you i mean the trouble of one of the 
with panpsychism is it seems very counterintuitive because we naturally think that electrons have consciousness and not a whole 
of direct evidence in favor of it on the other hand you might say also not a whole lot 
direct evidence against it not like got any experimental evidence that electrons are not conscious sc well let me 
than harp on that let me just try to figure out what it would mean for electrons to have 
or experiences or consciousness it certainly mean another quantum number in the physical sense right they have happy electrons 
sad electrons that would change much of particle physics in bad ways so is it is it some kind 
epiphenomenalism do the happiness or sadness if we wanna call it that just go along with the electron what 
what the electron is feeling dc the way i the best option for a panpsychist here is yeah you 
a whole bunch of extra new laws of physics for the consciousness at the basis rather consciousness fundamentally playing 
causal role for the physics that we know i mean a point often been made about physics and the 
of physics is fundamentally structural or mathematical everything is basically explained by how it relates to other things maybe 
mechanics gets messy and everything else in contemporary physics gets even messier so just start with classical physics that 
particles the positions in space and time with some mass with some forces that operate on them then what 
mass in classical physics well this thing which is subject to the laws of gravitation and the laws of 
dc and that is involved in forces in a certain nothing here tells us what mass is in itself 
explains mass by the way that particles with mass interact with other particles with mass sc what its role 
yeah dc so all a giant structure and physics does a great job of characterizing this structure and then 
that raises the question well what what is the intrinsic nature of mass well one thing someone might say 
need to have an intrinsic nature just a giant relational and a respectable view which i think some people 
it make sense other people think it makes sense but another sc structural realism dc structural realism is what 
gets called in the contemporary philosophy of science and ontological structural realism says all there is in the world 
giant web of sc right okay dc but the other possibility people sometimes speak of epistemological structural realism what 
tells us is the structure but there may be some intrinsic natures underlying the structure and as far i 
tell a respectable possibility as well that mass does have an intrinsic nature that when two things with mass 
got some intrinsic properties that govern that interaction and of course the panpsychist idea is to say maybe that 
property is consciousness or experience or maybe protoexperience sc or mind enthusiasts yeah dc yeah and so where our 
lies at the at this bottom level serving as the intrinsic properties that underlie physical structure if a bowl 
plays we suddenly need to revise physics the structure of physics can stay exactly as it was just gonna 
some intrinsic properties that ground that structure then you might say now how is mind making a well not 
making a difference by suddenly having new laws in the picture for minds rather making a difference by being 
thing that grounds the physical web any time one mass interacts with another two particles say attract each other 
gravitational force on this picture ultimately gonna be their mental properties doing the work sc okay so not again 
this picture which may or may not be right but not saying that the mental properties affect the physical 
of the electrons so a physicist i know some personally might worry that this saying anything at all because 
everything the electrons do is just governed by the laws of physics these mental properties affect it but saying 
the wrong way to ask the question the kinds of things that are being explained by this positing of 
mental character underlying everything are not the behavior of the electrons but something deeper and something that kind of 
once you get complex organisms that we recognize as conscious dc and does the experience affect the behavior in 
sense yes in another sense no i mean certainly true this is not gonna be so exciting for a 
physicist in all the current physics can say the same physics with the experience underneath it or without it 
think a good thing sc we have all the excitement we need dc yeah if we had to revise 
too that would be it would give rise to all kinds of extra crazy complexities that said this is 
of an interpretation of current physics and of going on in the world underneath current physics and ultimately saying 
what is doing the work in physics at the bottom level is these intrinsic properties of mind or consciousness 
fundamental laws which we think of as laws connecting mass and mass or mass and motion or whatever are 
gonna be laws connecting little bits of experience in this structure from the outside all we see is the 
and we give it a mathematical description and we call that the laws of physics and great dc but 
reality underlying used to the idea what underlies a physical theory may involve more than what actually that we 
in experimental results on this hypothesis what underlies it in reality is a whole bunch of minds or experiences 
and pulling each other is this wildly speculative of course it is but is it ruled out by anything 
know well i think not so i think in a speculative vein at least a philosophical view to take 
sc and it must be tempting to look toward quantum mechanics for a place to implement these kinds of 
dc yeah quantum mechanics is of course a magnet for anyone who wants to find a place for crazy 
of the mind to interact with in the physical world because quantum mechanics is so illunderstood then it does 
suggestive properties that connect that may seem to connect to observation or the mind i would actually not connect 
quantum mechanics and panpsychism in the most promising role there are people who connect quantum mechanics and panpsychism and 
the right degree of quantum mechanical holism somehow you could see how all those individual experiences might add up 
a big experience lately though actually been thinking about quantum mechanics in the context of a different kind of 
which is more a kind of dualism with property dualism with properties of consciousness distinct from properties in physics 
somehow interacting with it dc if not gonna be a panpsychist and say consciousness is present at the bottom 
of physics then consciousness has to be the property of consciousness has to be separate from those other ones 
time mass charge and that raises the question now how does it interact either you say it epiphenomenal it 
nothing well kind of weird and consciousness has no effect at all in the physical world or you say 
has an effect on the physical world and then the question is how on earth do you reconcile that 
physics which seem on the face of it to have any room for consciousness to play that role dc 
there is of course this one i would say ageold idea it be an ageold idea because quantum mechanics 
only been around for a century or so but this one old idea that maybe at least one kind 
fairly traditional interpretation of quantum mechanics where minds could play a role in quantum mechanics namely via the process 
observation which collapses the quantum wave function of course very controversial but it is a very traditional picture of 
mechanics so two kinds of dynamics of the quantum wave function schrödinger evolution the normal thing and something weird 
happens on measurement and standard quantum mechanics says a measurement the wave function and a different thing from schrödinger 
dc now of course this immediately raises a million questions like on earth is measurement and why should that 
any special treatment the quantum measurement and many people run a mile at that point saying i want minds 
play a role in physics try something and they find themselves in everettstyle many worlds quantum mechanics or bohmstyle 
quantum mechanics or grwstyle collapse quantum mechanics which give minds a role and i think all those programs are 
and very interesting not against them but also interested in a possibility which may have been overlooked which is 
to make rigorous sense of a more face value interpretation of quantum mechanics where there is something special that 
place upon measurement dc now for your average well why can it just seems very strange to treat measurements 
fundamental that would involve treating the mind as fundamental and not something that everyone wants to do if on 
other hand inclined to think already reason to think the mind involves something fundamental and that consciousness is somehow 
fundamental element in nature then that reason to reject the view will not be a good reason to reject 
view and the question for me is just we actually make rigorous mathematical sense of the idea that once 
comes into the picture that the wave function sc is it fair to associate this view with something like 
where putting mind as the first thing that creates reality dc maybe an idealist version of this but i 
actually think of it as a version of property dualism that is the quantum wave function is real got 
existence it has nothing to do with the mind the universe has an objective wave function just as it 
on say an everettstyle view rather this aspect of the dynamics of the wave function which is affected by 
mind and under certain circumstances physical systems will produce consciousness under certain circumstances that consciousness will collapse the quantum 
function so descartes thought that the body affects the mind and the mind affects the body that was classic 
dualism think of this as an updated version of descartes in a property dualist framework got the quantum wave 
got some dynamics by which the wave function affects consciousness got some laws dc it might be say something 
integrated information theory that says when the wave function has enough integrated information then you get a bit of 
and then you need some other bit of dynamics by which consciousness can affect the wave function the idea 
was working on this with kelvin mcqueen a former student of mine now in philosophy and physics at chapman 
in california dc and the idea we started working with was something special about consciousness or maybe about the 
correlates of consciousness so that it resists quantum superposition everything in the world mass and charge most properties can 
into quantum superpositions but maybe there are some special properties that resist quantum superpositions maybe they go into superposition 
a moment but then they always collapse back or maybe the moment about to superpose they pick up determinate 
and then the thought was if that happens say consciousness is like that consciousness never enters a superposition the 
brain processes would be such that they would produce a superposition of consciousness then somehow they collapse into a 
state and then you might see that as an effect of consciousness on the physical processes in the brain 
could in principle give you an effective consciousness in the physical world and then the question but for me 
a a weird and speculative picture of course but theory of consciousness is weird and speculative for me the 
sc picking up old ideas from people like dc absolutely sc and dropped out of favor now but you 
reexamine them dc absolutely so wigner in one thousand nine hundred sixtyone remarked on the mindbody question as probably 
locus classicus for this people think they find the idea or hints of the idea at least in von 
and earlier in the this got associated with the dancing wu li masters and so on at which point 
started running a mile from this idea sc lost some respectability yeah dc and i think it has been 
in some unfortunate ways but i just wanna examine this idea see if we can get it on the 
as one of the many alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics which has upsides and downsides for me the question 
ultimately you give it a good coherent mathematical dynamics that works and is consistent with all of our if 
could be done then we can take it seriously now i should say that the version kelvin and i 
with does have one rather serious problem with the socalled quantum zeno effect sc okay yeah dc roughly the 
zeno effect says if got some quantities that are constantly being measured always measured so they never enter into 
then they never change so if you constantly measure the position of a particle never move sc i can 
where this would be a problem yes dc if consciousness is such that constantly never entering into a superposition 
least as if consciousness is always being measured which means that consciousness can never change so for example if 
start out with an early universe with no consciousness then consciousness will never get a chance to come into 
the moment a little glimmer of consciousness gonna snap back only in one tiny little low amplitude part of 
wave function will there be consciousness and with probability one it will snap back to no consciousness so consciousness 
never evolve furthermore you can never wake up from a nap laughter if unconscious never get be little branches 
develop consciousness snap back to unconscious but probably will be worse sc that sounds like a good world now 
like dc yeah sc the never waking up from the nap world dc naps go on forever it was 
small small problem for the initial simplest version of the theory which now trying to work this into a 
result paper called zeno goes to copenhagen sc okay dc bridging the zeno effect is a problem for a 
of interpretations nearby but then the question is there a version of this you can make work that suffer 
this zeno been playing around with probabilistic versions and versions where consciousness superposes for a while and collapses back 
say we exactly solved the problem yet but i think at least an interesting class of interpretations here worth 
seriously if you are inclined to take consciousness seriously and after all quantum mechanics is enough of a mess 
worth trying yes dc not like any interpretations that is free of problems so if something here that a 
you a perfectly adequate quantum mechanics and b allows a role for consciousness in the physical world that would 
least be reason to take the view seriously sc and if you are a property dualist if you believe 
mental properties as well as physical properties of stuff does that have implications for questions like artificial intelligence or 
on a computer dc you know i think it have immediate implications some people think that if a property 
you should think that computers be conscious to me kind of odd i mean biological systems who are with 
and somehow conscious so why should silicon be any worse off than say brains that almost seems like a 
materialist idea to privilege things made of dna over things made of silicon why should that make a difference 
think dualism is just neutral on the question the kind of property dualism i like a fairly scientific naturalistic 
dualism with fundamental laws of nature i think gonna come down to are the properties of matter that get 
to consciousness in our theory of consciousness are they gonna be more like specific biological properties or are they 
be more like computational or informational properties dc if something like integrated information that gives you consciousness well it 
like that could be present just as much in a silicon system as in a biological system so in 
work done at least tried to argue that really the computational properties of matter that are relevant to consciousness 
the informational properties if the case then an ai system will be able to do the job just as 
and in principle we could even replace some neurons one at a time the biological neurons by silicon prosthetic 
if they work well enough be left with a functionally identical system and i would actually argue that that 
identical system is gonna retain the same consciousness throughout the alternative would be to say that sc fades away 
fades away or disappears but i think that gives rise to all kinds of problems sc right and before 
was asking if sure not a zombie this leads us to ask if we are sure that not a 
simulation right dc this is one of the great problems of philosophy descartes said do we know that an 
world how do you know not being fooled by an evil demon merely producing experiences in you as of 
external reality where all of this is just being generated by the now the simulation idea is a wonderful 
version of descartes as illustrated by movies like the matrix still a fan of the depiction of this movie 
the matrix that really i think got quite a lot of this right how do you know not living 
a computer simulation that is the computer simulation is playing the role of the evil demon running a model 
a world feeding your brain experiences when in fact you think you think in an ordinary physical reality but 
fact in this computergenerated reality and the people who wrote movies like the matrix they say this is the 
then basically living a life of illusion and deception and none of it is sc not the real world 
which is exactly what descartes thought about the evil demon hypothesis so been thinking about this lately and i 
take the simulation idea seriously i think nothing we know with certainty that rules out the idea in a 
simulation the philosopher nick bostrom has actually given a statistical argument that we should take it very seriously that 
are in a simulation roughly the idea is that any sufficiently intelligent population will have the capacity to create 
and lots of computer simulations of whole populations so as long as they go ahead and use their abilities 
create computer simulations then the majority of beings in the universe will be simulated beings and not unsimulated beings 
and then the thought is just do the math do the statistics of beings in the universe are simulated 
a whole bunch who are just like me what are the odds that one of lucky ones at ground 
the so you might say should be nine hundred ninetynine out confident that i am a simulated now you 
raise issues with the reasoning here and one question is a simulated being be some people might say they 
not conscious be if so the fact that conscious shows that not in a simulation sc you think conscious 
ahead dc but at least not gonna help me at least on record as thinking that a simulated system 
ai system could be just as conscious as a biological system so i think all those beings in computer 
may well be conscious maybe only okay even if only likely conscious then that still should give a big 
of probability to the hypothesis that in a simulation so not gonna help so i think actually possible that 
i rule out that in a simulation where i wanna get off the boat though is this idea that 
are illusions that simulations real i think we could be we could be in a world which is a 
dc but if so that mean that no tables and chairs in the world around us no matter all 
illusion i think what we should say is instead in a world with tables and chairs and matter and 
if in a simulation then if we discover in a simulation have made a surprising discovery about what tables 
chairs are made of they are ultimately made of say information and computational processes at the next level down 
may ultimately be realized in processes in the next universe and importantly all still real not like as descartes 
a world where nothing around you exists yes the world around me exists it just has a surprising nature 
this actually connects nicely to the ideas about structural realism we were talking about before that really physics tells 
about the structure of the world dc it tell you ultimately about what that structure is made up of 
in a simulation it turns out the structure is the mathematical structure of our reality may be exactly as 
says just that all implemented or realized on a computer in the next universe up so yeah the structure 
physics is real so the electrons are still real just ultimately electrons made of bits made of whatever is 
in the next universe up sc you said we ever find is there any way we would ever find 
dc it depends how well the simulation is made it laughter dc if like the one in the matrix 
they gave us some potential ways out like the red sc very buggy code yeah dc and yeah a 
way to build a simulation if you ask me unless you want people to escape if a perfect simulation 
may never find out and because of that i think if not in a simulation we may never be 
to prove that not in a simulation because in a perfect simulation any evidence any proof we can get 
be simulated by being through the same experiences so i think never never know for sure the negative claim 
in a simulation it could be that if we are in a simulation we could get some very decisive 
for that if the simulators suddenly move the moon around in the sky and write big signals and we 
at our genetic code and we find messages written in there saying losers in a then take that to 
pretty strong sc there is the preexisting hypothesis of god having done all this not that different god doing 
things from our programmers doing these things dc yeah yeah indeed yeah exactly and and the question of evidence 
for god as well i mean we could in principle get decisive evidence that there is a god very 
to get decisive evidence that not a god sc and you think that realistic to think that we can 
least imagine doing simulations that are so good that a multiplicity of intelligent conscious creatures exist there in our 
dc i think so in principle i mean i just a matter really of computer power and once you 
we know the laws of physics well enough presumably we could set up a universe with boundary conditions which 
allowable boundary conditions for a universe like us set up the differential equation simulators on maybe there will need 
be a quantum computer to especially to get the quantum mechanics right but then i see why in principle 
maybe be hard to get a universe as complex as our universe sc oh yeah it would have to 
less dc every universe is finite overlapping conversation sc has to be less right dc yeah if our universe 
finite and it has say one billion units of complexity then we simulate something with one billion units of 
but maybe something with one million units of complexity just not to tax the universe too much and of 
if we are in the enormous universe that we seem to be in now with enormous resources that seems 
have resources to be able to simulate some pretty complicated universes without too much trouble in principle sc these 
of scenarios whether descartes or simulations or whatever can or god creating the universe can we apply some kind 
anthropic reasoning here and ask if this were the case would that have some implications for what the universe 
look like and then ask it does or does not look like that like certainly said you want to 
if you wanna argue that the finetuning in the universe of certain fundamental physics parameters that therefore allows for 
existence of life is evidence for the existence of god then you should be consistent in that argument and 
out that there are other things about our universe that look wildly unlike you would expect if the point 
the universe existing was for our life to can we say similar things about the purported simulators dc yeah 
might worry that most simulations are gonna have certain properties and that our universe does or have those properties 
mean one thing about our universe is enormous it seems to be enormously big sc very big laughter dc 
complicated why would you waste your sc yeah it does dc if gonna be making simulations you might think 
simulations are gonna be a whole lot smaller and local for many purposes why would the simulators be generating 
universe quite as big and as complex as we are you might think your of course whatever you do 
in a universe like like us gonna involve a whole bunch of people making simulations of universes which are 
in turn universes which are simpler in turn more and more of those ever simpler universes so you might 
that actually most universes are gonna be very very simple sc exactly what i would think dc yeah i 
i might have heard sean carroll making sc i think i made this point yes right dc in the 
at some point and then so yeah the very fact that in a complicated universe is gonna be at 
some reason to disfavor the simulation hypothesis sc now of so to a little bit of back and forth 
one could respond to that by saying we know the universe is big we see galaxies in the sky 
really we see photons that have recently reached us we see the galaxies themselves maybe nothing more than a 
million light years away and all just set up to make us think but then in some sort of 
nightmare and really do we have to do anything at all dc yeah semiskepticism maybe just like everything out 
the solar system actually sent probes out to sc we think we have dc to other planets and so 
so the i gotta be hard just to simulate like new york city because so many people leaving new 
city all the time and coming back and the news from the at the very least gonna have to 
a pretty detailed simulation of the rest of the earth to keep all of the sc right be incredible 
and tv and everything going but once you move outside the earth it gets at least a bit easier 
maybe the moon is just i mean at least gonna need a fairly detailed simulation of the moon because 
the role it plays in our lives but maybe beyond a certain point you can run a very cheap 
maybe beyond pluto just got a very cheap simulation of the rest of the universe every now and then 
the simulators say just made a new discovery discovered a new form sc planet dc new way to monitor 
looking a little bit closer at these exo and maybe they scramble and they come up with some new 
for us but maybe gonna turn out to be much easier to run a cheap simulation sc but even 
these words make you think that maybe this is not the world we live in dc that this is 
the sc that these are all kind of arguments against living in a simulation just our universe does look 
bigger than it does you can imagine things the simulators could do but why are they going to all 
trouble laughter dc i think quite possible though that i know whether our universe is infinite quite possible that 
basic universe is infinite and maybe in the next universe up they have infinite resources it turns out that 
a large finite universe is no problem at all in fact they can simulate infinite universes because in an 
universe have the resources to simulate an infinite number of infinite universes without problems as long as we fall 
the trap of thinking that the next universe up has to be just like ours then i think all 
are off sc and are there ethical implications for this or are there implications of this idea for how 
should think about ethics number one should we think about ethics in our world differently if simulations and should 
worry about making simulations with conscious creatures and treating them well dc i think that the ethics of our 
be affected drastically by this any more than it has to be affected drastically by the theistic hypothesis that 
a universe with a god still conscious beings living our lives treat other people well make sure they have 
and large positive conscious experiences rather than negative ones maybe we need to think about the impact of our 
on the people in the next universe up but since we really know what what that impact is you 
say selfinterest comes into this after all if we want to live on religious hypotheses people modify their behavior 
in order they can live forever we might want to make sure the simulators keep us around sc i 
it does open the possibility of an afterlife right if in a simulation dc yeah maybe quite just as 
simulation hypothesis here has a very naturalistic version of god it could have a naturalistic version of an afterlife 
already see in tv shows like black mirror that people come to the end of their lives and they 
into a simulation and keep going keep going that way likewise sc have you read iain culture novels dc 
actually i should sc oh okay you certainly should because part of a small part except for one novel 
it plays a major role but this idea that yeah they do simulations all the time there are consciousnesses 
agents in the simulations and therefore the intergalactic organization has passed laws you end the simulations that would be 
but then certain very very bad civilizations that actually turn them into hells where they torture the ais that 
in the right way dc so i think the ethical questions absolutely get a grip once we start thinking 
creating our own simulations and sure any number of people are gonna be tempted just once got the capacity 
start up a copy of sim universe running on our iphone and maybe get a thousand copies up and 
and see what happens overnight run the entire history of this universe gather the statistics could be useful for 
purposes could be useful for marketing purposes predicting what products are gonna do well could just be useful sc 
even go there but yes dc oh for sure you wanna test your different products and see which iphone 
gonna sell the best for sure but yeah i think the ethical issues really are enormous gonna be creating 
with billions of billions trillions maybe infinitely many people and each of which is living a life as a 
being and if they are lives of suffering then done something horrific if they are lives of pleasure then 
done something good but yeah people talk about god create when creating us the best of all possible worlds 
was there so much sc evil and suffering dc well maybe god created many different universes all the ones 
had a net balance of positive experiences over negative experiences turned out by creating all those worlds then somehow 
was a net positive in creating them well gonna face questions like this too maybe if you want to 
experimental worlds where suffering you can only do that when a net balance of positive experiences in your simulations 
make up for it even then gonna say you could have created an even better world with a bit 
suffering and a bit more pleasure or fulfillment or satisfaction certainly you did something immoral by creating this i 
gonna have to face all those questions not gonna have easy answers sc okay speaking of easy answers two 
questions for you david one is working on a book i know well in advance but we can prime 
audience to be ready do you wanna say anything about what the book will be dc sure yeah the 
of the book is very much this set of issues been talking about for the last few minutes about 
and about virtual reality my working title probably be the final title but the working title is reality artificial 
and the great problems of philosophy and all about exploring philosophical problems like our knowledge of the external world 
the nature of reality through this through the idea of artificial or virtual reality so are we in a 
one of them but also i really want to develop my own philosophical line which is virtual reality simulated 
is a genuine kind of reality not a fake or a secondclass reality sc right dc a perfectly respectable 
for a world to be and i think this is relevant not just for way out speculation science fiction 
like living in a simulation but very practical scenarios like the virtual reality technology being developed today things like 
oculus rift where people enter into virtual worlds and start spending more and more of their time there easy 
imagine fifty or one hundred years in the future all gonna be spending a lot of our time in 
virtual worlds and the gonna arise is that can you actually lead a meaningful life there sc yeah and 
is not even sure this is a meaningful question is this aimed at a popular audience or professional philosophers 
both dc i would say both but absolutely trying to make it as accessible as possible so anyone can 
this book sc you have tenure so you can do that dc yeah i hope they revoke it but 
meant to be both introducing a whole lot of philosophical ideas but also putting forward a substantive philosophical view 
my own but roughly this view is that virtual reality is a firstclass reality across all of these domains 
think it has bearing on the great philosophical problems how do we know an external world problem it has 
on the question of the relationship between mind and body and has a bearing on these ethical questions about 
makes a meaningful and valuable existence or life of the kind so i think actually a way to come 
some of the deepest philosophical problems just through this lens of just as thinking about artificial intelligence turns out 
shed light on many questions about the human mind i think thinking about artificial realities turns out to shed 
on all kinds of questions about the actual natural reality we find ourselves in so what trying to do 
and the last question is tom stoppard one of my favorite living playwrights playwrights period he wrote a play 
the hard problem how does it feel to have a phrase you coined become the title of a tom 
play laughter dc oh i i was very pleased i think actually it was my friend dan dennett who 
me the email he read this in an article and said a tom stoppard play coming up called the 
i said has this got something to do with but it turns out it does and actually gotten to 
tom stoppard a little as a result of this process he put it had its american opening in philadelphia 
couple of years ago maybe about a year ago at the wilma theater in philadelphia and i went down 
and did an event with tom where the two of us were talking on stage about the hard problem 
consciousness dc the play is very interesting not convinced actually about consciousness at its root about a much broader 
of questions some of which involve consciousness some of which involve god some of which involve value and in 
in this discussion it sort of emerged that not it seemed to be that the problem that was really 
things for tom was not the problem of consciousness but the problem of value how can you have the 
of some things being better than others of life being meaningful of sorrow versus happiness of course very deeply 
to consciousness sc right dc but i suggested to him that really his hard problem is the problem of 
and he agreed he said thank you i think maybe really moving me the hard problem of sc another 
hard problem but okay not the hard problem but all mixed up i mean you gotta write the best 
right even when an advisor for hollywood movies about science the goal is to make the best movie not 
be the best science documentary dc but the play is about to open actually here in new york at 
lincoln center sc oh alright dc so i have another round of all of this coming up actually the 
wanna give away any spoilers about the play but at some point they mention the main character goes to 
with a professor at nyu whose ideas are said to be indemonstrable and various people have asked me whether 
actually fairly confident that not i think my colleague tom nagel sc you think tom nagel okay right dc 
nagel who wrote what is it like to be a bat sc yes dc and the professor at nyu 
but simply the label of being a philosopher whose ideas have been called nondemonstrable really narrow things down too 
dc oh no i was at yeah i was talking about this with my colleague ned block three of 
at nyu who work on the philosophy of consciousness and we decided that the philosopher in question surely be 
of us because our ideas are demonstrable sc absolutely right alright david chalmers thanks so much for being on 
podcast dc thanks been a pleasure music while more along the lines of chalmers here purely because consciousness is 
subjectively ha persuasive this raises the question of whether certain questions the these universal etc run into a wall 
a certain point it seems like humans are hardwired for goalseeking explanationseeking behavior and that these questions will inevitably 
however they may just not have any suitable answers for my part though i would suggest that consciousness and 
various offshoots including what religious folks might attribute to spiritual forces does not require that we posit any additional 
per se these are emergent from physicalbiological systems but are of such complexity that they behave as if they 
independent from said systems in the aggregate cultures arises from the collection of consciousnesses and again at a certain 
of complexity take on qualities as if they are independent of those underlying consciousnesses this is not to say 
any of these things are are as real as anything else that requires consideration and in fact reductionist attempts 
diminish these phenomena fall short i think it is important that sean pointed out that any proposed panpsychic property 
fundamental particles can not be an additional quantum number nor can it be a new particle quantum field being 
layman myself i have to say that this is the most important message i found in sean talks and 
that i had not found anywhere else in about twenty years of consuming popular science books and magazines that 
laws of physics underlying our everyday life are completely known in this talk it is from minute twentynine to 
thirtysix and here are the slides from the talk about turning feynman diagrams by ninety degrees how we find 
stuff in particle accelerators and the boundaries of that search where we have already looked the and what it 
or rather does not mean for our everyday life httpsdeslidesharenetmobileseanmcarrollpurposeandtheuniverse slides sixteen to twentyone i remember in which of 
talks sean mentions the problems that arise from additional quantum numbers would have been nice if he elaborated a 
on that in the podcast but i guess have to rewatch some more of the older stuff anyway this 
goes right to my favorites list it is as clear and as compressed as it can get thanks a 
to me it seems the hard problem is to either accept that weak emergence illusion is the way to 
or else believe in strong emergence the hard problem but never be able to get any evidence for it

as it can get thanks a lot what are my conclusions either stay with sean carroll and sabine hossenfelder 
on the weak emergence illusion spectrum and feel uneasy about it or change to the strong emergence hard problem 
that pretty much seems conceptually locked in a position where it never can get any evidence as shown by 
zombieproblem sorry for that doublepost when i was trying to edit the ending it seems i inserted the whole 
i have tried to think about the dualist approach some more and it makes no sense whatsoever if the 
lived on a separate plane and all interactions would actually happen on that psychic level then the whole materialist 
would be epiphenomenal the only way to explore that psychic world would be via my own psyche consciousness those 
claim to have gained psychic insights either via meditation or psychoactive drugs or by claiming to be a medium 
ghosts or channeling or whatever would have to provide useful insights preferable nonlocal stuff assuming that the psyche was 
to partake in nonlocal phenomena like telling the future looking instantly at far away places not even mentioning telepathy 
telekinesis etc pretty sure that the predictive power of those proclaimed is zero even the predictive power or usefulness 
pure thought without experimental evidence is already limited as shown in philosophy and theoretical physics hence repeatable experiments and 
conditions are needed to distinguish between models which imho is also shown in the fruitless discussion about the hard 
and the zombies in this podcast if the psyche was more fundamental than the body material world expect there 
be telepathy etc even if as proposed it was the part doing the collapsing of the wave function choosing 
possibilities multiverses expect to get more sixes while rolling the dice etc if either the body or the psyche 
then the psyche is the better candidate and if all is just one big pattern that be separated then 
really is no difference between the zombie and the human and then it all comes down to flavor or 
i always wonder why people bow away from physics as soon as it tends to get a bit more 
than we can currently understand it is a bit like looking at a closeup of a holographic surface or 
piece of compiled computer code you can barely see anything useful or at first sight but that does not 
there is nothing just that we quite get it yet as it clearly is a matter of perspective and 
really love to hear sean carroll talk to joscha bach about this topic another brilliant researcher with a sparkling 
who approaches these questions from a more general computational corner that would be super interesting thanks alot for this 
podcast all the best the simulation hypothesis seems to built on assumptions that either true or are unlikely to 
true also people who push this hypothesis often seem to argue that the simulation is basically identical to the 
world so that would mean not a simulation at all just because something is created on another plane by 
civilization or is calculated by a computer mean not a part of the physical universe i propose that if 
simulation is identical to the physical world then it is not a simulation at all also sean appreciate it 
you unblocked me on twitter drafthobbyist not completely sure why you ever blocked me easily over a year ago 
it could have something to do with me being a rights activist if you possibly jumped to the conclusion 
i was a misogynist because of that or something not sure anyways been disappointing being blocked by you for 
was seemingly for no reason pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast david chalmers on consciousness the hard problem and living 
a simulation three quarks daily the panpsychist version of phenomenal properties playing the role of dynamics is a bit 
to get into but it is quite simple if you overcome the current conceptualizing of what and are basically 
they are so all physicists have a conception of matterenergy lets say you were a superconscious alien who believed 
people were unconscious zombiesautomata liek we do for fundamental physical things and observed their behaviour during summer they will 
in an economic law of demand that water consumption increases the alien could provide a structural explanation demand increases 
to dehydration which makes some neurons of those automata exciting and this causes compels them to head to the 
and exchange an paper with an amount on it she would think that no consciousness or experience is needed 
this and that structure is all there is yet it is the experience of thirst that makes this causal 
possible a person with damage in that part of the brain that abolishes thirst or pain or anything would 
to be reminded or even forced to drink water this is similar to the physical laws it is basically 
of much much simpler consciousor protoconsciousagents so the em forces could be a protoquale that compels these protoagents to 
these regularities a bit exotic for us but ultumately i think even our senses can be traced back to 
simple qualia so the phenomenalityor protophenomenalityis always the thing that plays the causal role and this is what makes 
mathematical structure possible observed in physical experiments a bit hard to swallow that basically the universe is alive in 
sense but after thinking about it for a while it looks a bit less crazy ofcourse this view has 
major problem which is the problem how many minds make one mind another serious problem altogether sean carrol is 
of my favorite voices in science and chalmers one of my favorite voices in philosophy of mindconsciousness i still 
anything new was gleaned from this meeting of the minds and it did seem like sean confront or contradict 
of what chalmers relayed which was pretty much just a general synopsis of his viewpoint i was hoping to 
more where the two of them could build a consensus at least a consensus on what is truly unknown 
perplexing unique when it comes to consciousness naturalism in its current state limited by the volume of data produced 
orthodox science is truly a nonsatisfactory explanation for consciousness at least where the boundary of naturalism in regards to 
was decently explained by chalmers i believe what chalmers is saying is that if there is only monismmaterialismphysics as 
basis for consciousness then the model should explain why there appears to be the illusion of cartesian dualism subjective 
almost by definition is the experience of an other world the outside world experienced by an inside world not 
just can think but can experience visceral and complex physical sensations which are pure raw experiences from the subjective 
there is only dualism and no matter what dualism seems to creep up in new forms with each new 
of consciousness that comes out thanks to the both of you full disclosure i do not stand to profit 
this in any way shape or form but somehow i feel obligated to report my almost complete agreement with 
of reasoning from the start having read big and even in the act of reading it i remember agreeing 
him somewhere around of the time somehow sounds a bit sycophantic and so there it is i tend to 
with him on quite a lot do not know if he would agree with the following statements it seems 
me that the of consciousness is not as hard as may seem no doubt it is not an easy 
by any means but i feel perfectly satisfied with the emergent phenomena explanation it just seems perfectly reasonable to 
that the effect of having one hundred billion neurons and ten trillion connections between them i hope i have 
numbers right would inevitably lead to something like consciousness given certain evolutionary ok i can understand the complaint that 
a bit as the mechanism specify precisely the method of incorporation but neither do we know precisely how a 
of atoms becomes a stool or a table or any other abstract object that requires understanding of context to 
up yet no one complains that understanding abstractions like stools and tables is a somehow we are quite willing 
accept that and one more point how do we feel about consciousness of animals are they fully conscious or 
they in some zombie state we really ask and yet i have a feeling that some of them are 
conscious as can be as conscious as you and i although maybe not to same degree dogs for instance 
cognitive abilities of a threeyearold or a fouryearold but they are still conscious are they not and if they 
then consciousness is not some mysterious metastate but indeed an emergent phenomena of a sufficiently complex collection of neurons 
in some specific configuration by evolutionary processes over millions of years i got lost when you agreed that beings 
consciousness would be zombies indistinguishable from beings with it the fact that you called them zombies and defined hard 
as imparting self awareness means that beings without it would behave quite differently why then did you agree that 
them apart from beings would be so hard zombies i think these simple questions need to be answered before 
start getting into is not result of physical brain and the ie the hard problem when parts of brain 
damaged or removed specific aspects if consciousnessawarenessperceptions change or even gone alcohol andor drugs that alter the brain chemistry 
the consciousnessawarenessperceptions listening to the discussion about panpsychism and whether experience changes how fundamental particles or atoms behave i 
of lee statement in his recent book singular laws only arise on intermediate scales by coarse graining which forgets 
that makes events unique and allows them to be modeled as simple classes which come in vast numbers of 
hence the newtonian paradigm works only on intermediate my take while there is experience incarnate in say a hydrogen 
the modicum that is present does indeed have a causal role to play but statistically speaking large numbers of 
behave in a very lawlike way as experiential capacity increases correlate with organizational complexity it becomes more and more 
to predict the behavior of those physical entities living organisms human beings etc i have to believe that if 
were an exact copy of sean carroll sean would be just as conscious as sean how could it be 
there are other moralethical and sociologicalpsychological reasons why the consciousness and connection to physical brain and electrochemistry stay elusive 
in the realm of the obvious and unquestionable ethical reason is that we do not do active invasive and 
damaging experiments nor should we do experiments with human brains to explore the connections between consciousness and brain we 
only do indirect observations of this by observing effects of brain damage or hearing experiences of persons who may 
taken drugs or alcohol by self volition until recently this was the case however the recent noninvasive techniques like 
mri etc are changing this rapidly which may render the connection of consciousnessmind to brain less mysterious the sociologicalpsychological 
is that historically most people want there to be some extramagical stuff that they feel should be there to 
absence of this extramagical explanation they feel somehow diminishes the especially their own consciousnessmind this is sort of like 
description of in as the humanity gets more scientifically learned more and more people sometimes begrudgingly are starting to 
that need for magicextra you command a truly impressive breadth of knowledge sean good interview i wonder whether you 
clarify why you find it plausible that you are a zombie you started making an argument based on the 
that a real zombieyou would likewise say they are conscious but i am not sure why you find that 
experiment more persuasive than your own personal experience of actually having an inner life a conscious mind not just 
a possible world but in the real world btw if you read it i think you would enjoy steven 
folk psychology to cognitive a wonderfully lucid takedown of the common notion of belief belief is very hard to 
down but also very hard to do without we are carbon based life forms and at some point carbon 
aware that it was carbon all the other elements in our human bodies became aware of their own existence 
holds that there is nothing more to us than these elements and regardless of how they are organized in 
brains they are still material and insufficient to account for the existence of consciousness the hard problem boils down 
how do we account for consciousness when the only source of our existence are these entities for scientists who 
pansychism as a possible answer the harder problem is what is the origin of panpsychism might it be possible 
consciousness exists because the universe would have no meaning without those who observe and marvel sean your podcast just 
getting better i enjoyed the chat chalmers had with sam harris on the waking up podcast some time ago 
this one was even better i would dearly love to see you get david deutsch on some time i 
up my donations just to hear that i think you guys could have a truly fascinating conversation keep up 
great work just a ps to my former post an analogy to my last point is the game of 
it requires a pitcher and a catcher the interesting thing about the analogy is that the catcher is alternately 
pitcher and the pitcher is the catcher the game has no meaning without both not sure why you more 
consider the possibility that consciousness is a pattern of relationships among firing neurons you did discuss integrated information theory 
for some unstated reason seemed to dismiss it as unsatisfying chalmers dismisses but life is different from nonlife as 
result of the emergence of a new pattern of causation see rosen life itself so why not view consciousness 
the result of a new strange loop pattern of causal relationships among mental events thoughts causing thoughts about thoughts 
subjective and internal because my cause your thoughts to be about my thoughts i would argue that hofstadter had 
right in am a strange seems to me that definitions are rather important here if we define consciousness in 
of subjective experience eg qualia talking about the processing of sensory information what we are conscious of whether external 
or internal interoception this implies sensory apparatus and processing apparatus eg a nervous system given the sophistication and complexity 
our own nervous systems we might speculate that apparent richness of consciousness corresponds to the sophistication and complexity of 
system that supports it and looking around the animal kingdom this does seem to be the case as far 
we can judge the problem i have with the philosophical zombie is that seems to presuppose some kind of 
if consciousness is a function of certain brain processes as neuroscience suggests then even if it is epiphenomenal to 
consciousness means removing the brain processes that produce or support it which would make the pz measurably different from 
conscious person however if consciousness is not a function of brain processes then we should not expect it to 
influenced by the manipulation of brain processes yet it is one issue here is the apparent reification of consciousness 
tend to abstract the concept of it is to be a particular system human bat etc give it the 
and then treat it as something independent in its own right perhaps because we see ourselves as that are 
with or inhabit our bodies rather than being functions of or processes in our bodies theory and its measure 
promising but if you can produce very high phi values with relatively simple arrays of logic gates as scott 
says it unavoidably predicts vast amounts of consciousness in physical systems that no sane person would regard as particularly 
all indeed systems that do nothing but apply a lowdensity paritycheck code or other simple transformations of their input 
moreover iit predicts not merely that these systems are conscious which would be fine but that they can be 
more conscious than humans this suggests that a high degree of integrated information is necessary but not sufficient and 
at the brain consciousness only occurs if certain kinds of information are integrated in certain ways ultimately it seems 
the subjectiveobjective dichotomy must make an objective explanation of subjective experience problematic we could potentially elucidate all the objective 
of consciousness and produce a mapping so that we can infer detailed experience from brain activity or even identify 
the necessary functions or processes so that we can construct a conscious but if we knew all the necessary 
and we knew the functions of those parts and how they interacted would that subjective experience inevitably the subjective 
of other individuals or systems is only available via simile analogy ie via mappings to common shared or similar 
experiences with the assumption that common objective experiences produce similar subjective experiences not always the case we can examine 
or brain function to discover that they have redgreen colourblindness and we can produce images that simulate redgreen colourblindness 
so we can tell they have different experiences but we still know what it is like for them comments
