back in julien offray de la mettrie wrote an influential book called man a machine this is i think 
the enlightenment period in europe one of the first works to come out strongly in favor of being an 
there were hints by various people that maybe god all he was cracked up to be but still this 
absolutely clear man a machine that god exist we human beings are more like machines than embodied spirits the 
was a big time for machines in france and the rest of europe so this is a vivid metaphor 
the time and de la mettrie was not one of the great philosophers but he he was more like 
pundit i guess we would say in these days he had very vivid metaphors and language and examples he 
his case in a very clear way for people to understand sc i remember one of the points that 
made paraphrasing now been years since i read it but basically he was arguing against rene idea of mindbody 
that a human being is a body but then also a mind that is disembodied and somehow they talk 
each other and that makes the person so de la mettrie buy this he basically would say that the 
being is a physical object and the mind is emergent in our modern language but the example he used 
he says when i have had my cup of coffee or not had my cup of coffee a different 
depending on whether happened or not how can you possibly believe that the mind is completely separate from the 
when perfectly clear that my mind is deeply affected by what happens to my sc a very good point 
and of course the people who believe him have answers to it etcetera but nevertheless the example lingers in 
mind these days when we know even more about how the brain works how the body works how the 
works but still know nearly enough advancing in the direction of understanding not just how the mind works but 
to change how the mind works by messing with it by giving it coffee or giving it other sorts 
substances so today talking to robin carhartharris who is head of the centre for psychedelic research in the division 
brain sciences at imperial college london robin is one of the first people maybe the first people to study 
effects of lsd and other psychedelic drugs on patients in controlled clinical trials i should say he and his 
right medicine a lot of people working on this but for years now following the dictates of the united 
of all people most countries have just held all research into psychedelics off limits and those rules are finally 
to soften a little bit so we can do things like give a patient some lsd or some psilocybin 
them in an mri machine and see happening to their brain sc learning a lot learning about both how 
brain works for its own purposes curious about that but also learning about how there might be therapeutic advantages 
using drugs like this there was a certain reputation that psychedelics got in the in the and that gave 
a bad image as far as public relations is concerned but enormous potential here for using these for treating 
for treating addiction for endoflife care for pain management or just for helping people sort of become at peace 
themselves in different ways very early days i think for the research here and we really know why so 
to start thinking about it sc so remember the podcast mindscape has a web page preposterousuniversecommindscape where you can 
not just the show notes for this links to web pages and their research publications or what have you 
also full transcripts of all the episodes there are links you can click on if you want to donate 
things like that people who donate and become patreon members get ads on their podcasts and they also get 
ask me anything episodes and with that go music sc robin carhartharris welcome to the mindscape podcast robin carhartharris 
you nice to be here sc so a lot to discover here about psychedelics and therapies and the brain 
things like that but this is a topic unlike some that i do where presuming that many of the 
either have experience or opinions at least they know what lsd and magic mushrooms and things like that are 
a history that i think is fascinating why you say a few words about the history about how these 
came to be and also the legal choices that made it difficult to study them over the years rc 
sure i guess the history comes in a few phases people have talked about waves you have the first 
of psychedelic plant medicine use which is ancient in major geographical areas in central america and south america where 
plant medicines have been used for countless generations sc do we know a lot about how deep that goes 
and the history of those things in south america rc some people do chuckle not my particular expertise but 
goes back with mushrooms i think fair to say thousands of years in central america in terms of mushroomrelated 
they could be something else but they look pretty mushroomlike sc right right rc pictures as well that go 
a long way that depict mushroom ingestion ayahuasca difficult to know because of perhaps the lack of artifacts but 
least several hundred years back and very much ingrained in certain cultures in peru and brazil yeah and sc 
lsd for example we discovered in the century it was made rc we did yeah yeah so albert hoffman 
was kind of commissioned by a drugs company sandoz to play around with some ergot derivatives that was his 
so a fungus that grows on certain grasses rye grass and was associated with some interesting vascular effects and 
some intoxication as well poisoning and so he was looking at the potential vascular effects of the drugs potentially 
to stemming bleeding in birth sc okay so he looking for mental effects rc no he so it was 
classic medical serendipity that led him sc yeah and when was this rc this is he was playing around 
the drugs the war happened things got shelved and it was when he now famously was it two hundred 
two hundred fifty micrograms which he thought was a tiny amount of lsd turns out a pretty big trip 
then the now celebrated bicycle day the first bicycle day happened then in april i think the he took 
dose of lsd and was shocked at the effects thought he was dying actually before he got there he 
on his bike and rapidly cycled home he wanted somewhere comfortable perhaps if he was felt he was on 
way out but he describes what sounds like quite a nightmarish experience his neighbor comes around and she turns 
a malevolent witch who he thinks poisoned him and yeah he thinks dying yeah so the second wave and 
in this renaissance period the socalled third wave and in between we have the sc a good time in 
sense rc a good time in some sense but i guess a sad time in another sense in terms 
the pushback against psychedelic drugs which had very significant implications for psychedelic drug research and medical use leading to 
an outright ban on any kind of work with psychedelics from the late onwards and been decades really of 
hiatus in research until i guess in the most significantly you have characters like rick strassman and franz vollenweider 
pioneering work to bring psychedelic compounds back into the scientific space and then the noughties with significant things happening 
johns hopkins i guess we come onto the scene in the uk in the late noughties around i started 
research with psilocybin and we find ourselves here today where this is starting really to become quite mainstream sc 
it was banned internationally in the right the united nations they have much legal authority but they did at 
recommend that countries not let you use psychedelics for therapeutic purposes is that the idea rc yeah it was 
unwide initiative so any countries that fell firmly under that were implicated and most western countries in the eastern 
actually they carried on for a little bit longer doing work in the czech republic and a certain stanislav 
such a key figure in psychedelic work he carried on doing research with lsd into the early but then 
dried up as well sc and is it true that part of that was actually a backlash literally against 
using lsd and protesting vietnam and stuff like that rc yeah a few conspiracy theories but i think you 
to be too inventive in your imagination to see how these things fit together and it was a time 
particular social and political conflicts in the us very polarized and it seems there was a fear that perhaps 
were fueling some of the countercultural sentiments yeah and probably just a few things were going on in terms 
certain politicians seeing that it can be a potent votewinner to be seen as being hard on drugs or 
tough on crime tough on drugs rc yeah exactly and i guess nixon sort of embodied that with his 
on drugs and before that i know with lbj it was him really who started to curtail things and 
it was vietnam and a fear of people not being so loyal and obedient and perhaps having a bit 
an antiauthoritarian spirit and that being tied up with the whole psychedelic and drug use thing sc okay but 
sitting here in your office at imperial college in london where you do research on these substances presumably legal 
they change the law or did you get an exception or what happened rc yeah an exception you get 
license from the home office and not trivial to get one and quite expensive and a shame because it 
science hampers collaboration not easy just to send some drug off to another team or take it over to 
they need to be recognized and listed with the home office and if setting up they have to set 
a few thousand pounds and a bit of building work you need a fridge lock bolted to the wall 
there are inspections and such like these things might seem kind of trivial but you have to be really 
to make them happen and quite easy with all the relevant pressures that you have in any domain but 
academia to just not bother and sc hard enough for me to get a grant to do theoretical cosmology 
less get a drug sent to the lab must be a whole another thing yeah rc yeah well grant 
has been so difficult i think only been one or the medical research council in the uk supported our 
work and kind of an exception nihr in the uk have supported a colleague of mine say that was 
year ago so things might be changing but i know not much has happened in the us with nimh 
you have some obvious absentees there in terms of major funding bodies that supported this and got to change 
sc so explain to people what actually happens when a person takes some of these psychedelics for one thing 
it fair just to use the catchall phrase psychedelics or do we need to really distinguish between different ones 
could take rc yeah i think we need to distinguish a very sort of broad brush term this extended 
of psychedelic which i guess in a sense exploits the word itself the etymology there psychedelic means mind manifesting 
mind revealing and so people might say when you smoke cannabis you can have these major psychological insights when 
take mdma you can have insights and some so under that definition extend the definition of psychedelics to include 
compounds another way sc but sorry but technically most people who do psychedelic research would not include marijuana for 
rc i i guess the science thing where you know you need to be crisp in your definitions and 
for me the best scientific definition is one that comes from the pharmacology which is classic psychedelics and some 
there would be lsd arguably the prototypical psychedelic because it was only after its discovery that the term came 
mescaline as well given that humphry osmond came up with the word he was a well he was a 
psychiatrist working in canada he became friends with aldous huxley of brave new world and the doors of perception 
was his essay on his mescaline experience sc okay rc and the mescaline was provided by humphry osmond and 
from that there was a realization a shared realization that we needed a new term for this category of 
osmond came up with psychedelic but yeah so mescaline played a role in the birth of that term as 
a key role so lsd as a tryptamine and tryptamines are compounds molecularly are very similar to serotonin and 
one is dimethyltryptamine dmt which is found endogenously in some very small amounts in humans and many other animals 
think and lots of plant species dmt is the major psychedelic ingredient in ayahuasca this amazonian brew sc okay 
rc so some examples but the crisp definition is that all of these classic psychedelics share a certain pharmacological 
which is that they stimulate a certain serotonin receptor the serotonin receptor and then i could say a lot 
i think interesting things about the receptor where it is in the brain what associated with sc i think 
should say those interesting things yeah where is it in the brain so what is it this is a 
in individual neurons rc yeah yeah it sits in the membrane of individual neurons and the first thing to 
is that the receptor is heavily expressed in the cortex that aspect of brain that humans have so much 
all the wrinkly stuff and massively expanded in our species and where you find these key receptors that psychedelics 
on sc so going to be more susceptible to psychedelics than cat and dogs yeah rc probably they seem 
too but they their behavioral repertoire sc who would know really rc they talk so they just twitch and 
kind of thing our behavioral index of whether dogs and rodents are tripping or not yeah in humans we 
lots of cortex we have lots of serotonin is the receptor and not entirely evenly distributed in the cortex 
cortex like so much of the brain and so much of the body and nature is hierarchical it has 
hierarchical organization and at the top of the hierarchy you have the association cortex which in a sense is 
most mysterious because it have an obvious modular function like the visual system for example which most of the 
system is in the back of the brain sc right clear what that does rc yeah and the motor 
for movement motor action but the association cortex is sort of like a lot of things and associated with 
and high level psychological functions like sc so stitching things together and coming up with scenarios yeah sc yeah 
yeah stitching things together imagining things that there immediately in the environment so referred to as counterfactual thinking something 
people say might be unique to our species another thing that people say is probably unique to our species 
least in the magnitude that we have is selfconsciousness sc right rc probably what sets us apart and a 
associated with the association cortex where you see so much of these receptors so a good starting point the 
is an aspect of the brain that evolutionarily is quite recent and massively expanded in our species and associated 
these highlevel functions then we could look at what happens when you stimulate that receptortobrain function and there introduced 
notion which i hope is useful of this entropic brain idea sc oh okay rc where sc big fans 
the word entropy here in the mindscape podcast rc sure you are and this is where in a sense 
my expertise because not in physics or in information theory but i know that in information theory entropy is 
a fundamental metric related to our uncertainty about a system where if entropy is high uncertainty is high we 
what that system is going to do next unpredictable sc right rc and there the principle with psychedelics is 
simple this entropic brain principle which is that psychedelics increase the unpredictability of spontaneous brain activity sc okay rc 
rather spontaneous just means ongoing rather than invoked by a stimulus of some sort sc right so that even 
trying to be quiet and still in our minds a lot going on in our brains yeah rc yeah 
spontaneous brain activity you can think of a stream of consciousness and the imagination daydreaming those kind of things 
on yeah sc the stuff that trying to get a control over in a mindfulness exercise or at least 
knowledge of right rc yeah you try and with focus a few kind of interesting paradoxes there of course 
ordinarily that quality of consciousness is pretty rich but under psychedelics found richer still and found that this interesting 
quite reliable relationship between the richness of ongoing consciousness if you want and ongoing brain activity sc maybe before 
get there is what is the role of serotonin in the cortex other than psychedelics so it naturally appears 
do you know what there for rc yeah well serotonin is a really complex neuro modulator so it tunes 
function rather than it being a simple excitation or inhibition thing more about a complex tuning and the complexity 
serotonin is reflected in its number of subreceptors there are at least fourteen that have been identified and they 
do quite different things some of them actually oppose each function another thing that you see in nature and 
receptor is excitatory and it seems increases an irregular form of excitation and there might be a clue as 
what we see at the population level so groups of neurons where we see this entropic effect where the 
becomes harder to predict more complex sc right in the presence of the serotonin or in the presence of 
rc so well in terms of the basal functioning of the serotonin receptor the suggestion is that it do 
much because if you give a blocker of the receptor it really do much to consciousness it might make 
a little bit sedated it might make your thinking a little bit narrowed and stereotyped but a subtle effect 
rigidity but quite subtle sc so the low entropy high predictability kind of phase yeah rc yeah yeah and 
might be associated i guess by implication with a narrowing of the range of conscious content say in medicine 
often have a blocking component and some sleep drugs as well blockade seems to promote deep sleep so kind 
the opposite of what you see with psychedelics but then there is this rule of it the blockers seem 
do that much so they they certainly not the dramatic impact on consciousness that you see when you stimulate 
receptor sc which is what the psychedelics do yeah rc yeah and so part of my thinking and i 
others around the receptor is that maybe it becomes engaged naturally during exceptional conditions if not really doing much 
so in a kind of ongoing background kind of way then maybe there for some kind of emergency situations 
crises and got a paper in development at the moment which proposes that hypothesis and written other things that 
sort of led up to that hypothesis that a kind of crisis button in a way activating the system 
serotonin system so in conditions of as somebody else has said existential distress crises maybe you need to induce 
very plastic brain and mind states sc with the brain being more flexible rc yeah because your life literally 
on it or your wellbeing very much depends on it something has to give something needs to change having 
kind of psychological breakdown for whatever complex reasons you enter this state of hyperplasticity and then beyond that maybe 
is never the same again sc okay rc you can think of examples like epiphanies religious epiphanies hitting rock 
and major transformative experiences they happen outside of the context of psychedelics so natural to ask why do they 
how do they happen maybe they happen in a related way to how psychedelics work sc okay and so 
we take the and so we are grouping all the psychedelics together in this conversation should we be more 
about distinguishing which one does what rc well yeah when i talk about psychedelics really talking about the classic 
and i think probably most useful for listeners to think of the examples lsd psilocybin which is found in 
mushrooms dmt which is found in lots of plants and in ayahuasca mescaline is a phenethylamine a slightly different 
but still a classic psychedelic sc okay so all these stimulate this particular serotonin receptor rc yeah sc and 
quite get clear how i should think about what this is doing to the brain so a lot of 
going on in our brain even when trying to be quiet or our eyes are closed or whatever and 
impression is that the psychedelics rather than excite the brain they sort of let the brain have some access 
going on anyway in some sense is that fair rc yeah it is fair it is an excitation but 
irregular form of excitation so perhaps rather than think of it in a quantitative way where people have historically 
talk about regions in the brain lighting up or metabolism increasing or decreasing a little bit like a thermostat 
something going hotter or colder a little bit these days a bit too crude a way to depict the 
where it might be better to think of the quality of brain activity changing and there the thing to 
is that the regularity of brain activity changes activity becomes disregulated sc right i do remember reading about the 
effects in the brain become a little bit less predictable i guess rc yeah sc yeah and does that 
an easy relationship to the classic things that we think of as happening when on an lsd trip in 
of hallucinations visual and auditory or sometimes people see things that are just not there many times people just 
things that are there moving in weird ways right rc yeah so that notion that psychedelics are hallucinogens a 
bit misleading with eyes open things distort and sure things can sort of emerge if looking at something like 
clouds or whatever or on dmt and then things are really wild visually but more when you close your 
that the experience becomes very rich in imagery and very very vivid as if one is seeing with their 
closed a bit like dreaming sc is it a bit like dreaming or is it really the same thing 
dreaming in some sense rc probably a hybrid not quite the same thing but speculated and others have and 
of indirect evidence to back this up that the tripping state if you want is a hybrid waking dream 
so part of the mechanics and physiology of dreaming is actually happening while awake under a psychedelic and there 
a and this actually is probably the reason that drew me into this whole area in the first place 
the same way that sigmund freud famously said of dreams that they were a royal road to a knowledge 
the unconscious mind others have said the same stan grof and others about psychedelics and then you put two 
two together and you think by a matter of converging evidence something to this unconscious mind sc yeah yeah 
a lot of people who are not professional neuroscientists or psychologists have a pretty overly simplistic direct view of 
the brain works a visual field that comes in and we have a camera in our brains and there 
is and we hear things and also going on at the same time but my impression from my rather 
readings in these things is way more complicated and a lot of processing going on in the brain just 
give us this image of the world that we see around us what we think seeing is highly processed 
to what our eyes and visual cortex actually picks up rc absolutely you could say highly constructed in a 
top down way as in a lot that experiencing that comes from the brain itself rather than from the 
world and this is what karl friston will say when you have him on hopefully in a a very 
and thoughtful and precise way but perhaps in a way difficult to understand but no this notion of bayesian 
based on principles of probability that we house in our brains internal models through which we experience the world 
so much of experience is the product in a sense of these models that we house rather than some 
of receptivity of information coming in rc and the action of psychedelics is a bit of a clue to 
being true in the sense that we can almost see these models that constructed even the really high level 
like our sense of self and probably the most profound realization that people have on psychedelics is my goodness 
sense of personality and all the spiritual related sort of follows things that follow on from that experience come 
play sc yeah so we should think of what is happening to our brains on psychedelics not as seeing 
things but as you seem to be implying that revealing things that are going on inside our brain already 
yeah almost like an outside observer you can look at in a sense how the brain and mind work 
probably achieved through the fact that these internal models break down recently written with karl on this topic a 
paper that entitled rebus for relaxed beliefs under psychedelics sc oh okay nice rc a bit of a fudge 
all psychedelics are not what it is rc yeah sounds that way but hopefully memorable and yeah the idea 
that called precision weighting or confidence that we have in our internal models so like our confidence in who 
are dissolves breaks down relaxes under psychedelics and when that happens there is this curious possibility to step outside 
the model and then almost sort of view it or view its realize its absence sc almost have a 
person perspective on our first person consciousness rc yeah for example t throws up lots of interesting philosophical questions 
who is the sc well i talked to daniel dennett recently on the podcast and so one of the 
of this multiple drafts version image of consciousness where a lot going on that are sort of suggested ways 
viewing the world in your brain and then this i guess this associative part of your cortex knits them 
to make some final draft but yeah so no one of them is the final story i guess and 
you get to look at them individually you realize how nonunitary our selves really are rc yeah yeah how 
been stitched together yeah multiple drafts yeah sc and does a lot of people have advocated the use of 
for unleashing creativity in some way does this speak to that do you agree that this is a good 
of thing to do rc yeah probably the biggest block to creativity is being too sure being too confident 
too low entropy laughter rc yeah yeah which is a curious one and you can think of other drugs 
work perhaps even in a polar opposite way to psychedelics that give confidence the stimulants maybe a drug like 
actually published some work that based on a scale of ego dissolution and ego inflation these two drugs go 
different directions sc oh really yeah rc kind of an obvious thing sc yeah so it makes you a 
bit more sure of yourself rc yes it inflates the ego sc it makes you maybe less creative rc 
yeah you might be very productive sc yeah is there some right exactly rc but you might come up 
a lot of stereotypes manic kind of ramblings that particularly rangy and expansive whereas with psychedelics you really get 
expansion whether you can get the focus is another matter sc i mean the classic example of being on 
and thinking that had a wonderful insight and then you try to write something down and the next day 
nonsense right rc yeah yeah then the quality control comes in the bs detector the editor comes in perhaps 
but perhaps not always so fiercely and a lot to be said and people are increasingly aware of this 
the integration process the landing process after a big psychedelic experience is so important and there if there too 
haste to try and stitch things back up but rather just let them slowly kind of settle and crystallize 
a way most natural without forcing any kind of i know psychoanalytic interpretations necessarily and probably in that way 
treating it as a sort of organic process that things settle most healthily rc and sometimes there needs to 
a principle of just sitting still with some uncertainty perhaps things so crystal clear now and perhaps things so 
clear full stop and so that often comes up actually in our therapeutic work with psychedelics where a patient 
want closure on something something as literal as i and a responsibility i think on our part not to 
such a closure and there are historic examples of where gone wrong in traditional psychotherapy sc right you want 
answer rc yeah sc yeah and sometimes just hard to get or not there or not enough evidence to 
one way or the other yeah rc yeah yeah sc so there is this also this feeling that informally 
about scientific research but people feel that they are getting some deep insight into themselves or into the nature 
existence or something like that when on psychedelics always wondered how much of that you actually have gotten an 
or you have gotten the impression that gotten an insight somehow are there things that really stay with people 
once no longer on the drugs that count as profound insights about themselves rc there are but really hitting 
the million dollar question there and again the answer too black and white sometimes people do have profound insights 
stick with them that change their lives that they can communicate to other people who hear them and the 
lands and resonates and they say and when that happens often it feels like a deep spiritual wisdom and 
the resonance really is with things that one could read about in say buddhism or spiritual texts and there 
are insights that of course specific to psychedelics at all just more fundamental and basic than anything to do 
psychedelics rc just it so happened that for some people psychedelics have been the tool that have really led 
whatever breakthroughs that people have had and for some spiritual teachers i guess gurus if you want some quite 
ones psychedelics have actually especially western ones psychedelics have been the door opened for them that later on what 
with that druginduced insight is to put it into spiritual practice sc right rc and there i think that 
key term is practice rather than just keep going back to the drug where after a certain period of 
maybe more noise to be experienced than signal thought instead something to do some action to follow a healthier 
of being rather than going back to the drug teacher and all the projections that can go with that 
inherent to the drug that holds this intelligence so i think that can be quite a dangerous and problematic 
sc well it was very interesting what you said about the sort of loosening versus tightening of your thought 
when on a psychedelic versus a stimulant this longstanding informal belief that madness and creativity are somehow connected to 
other right being creative involves looking outside the box thinking of new things but in some sense you the 
is also important right like you know the ordinary rules also matter and all about finding a balance between 
and are psychedelics a way of moving the balance in one direction or another and going back and forth 
is that useful rc yeah it can be useful but equally it can be potentially problematic it can be 
when the constraints of the box are too firm and holding up progress and perhaps even leading to pathology 
personal or on a systemic level like on a social level sc people do have bad trips right and 
that depend on the person more or the drug or the situation rc yeah well they did have bad 
and sometimes they are really bad there is this fashion i suppose in the psychedelic science community to say 
such thing as a bad trip challenging experiences we call them challenging things to work through and overcome and 
lot of truth in that but equally for the sake of plain talking some trips are really really awful 
we can call them bad not fundamentally bad intrinsically in and of themselves sc but rc very unpleasant yeah 
and so i guess as a scientist some deep fascination in those experiences and to try and understand them 
would lean towards notions of the collective unconscious carl jung and archetypes around demons and devils and monsters very 
human images and ideas that yeah sc so saying that when people have a bad trip we can try 
understand what going through by reference to those ideas rc absolutely i think the best way to understand a 
way to try and understand them would be to say that literally real to invoke notions of magic that 
some bad demons or bad spirits are in the space or whatever that kind of projecting things into some 
space i think is one of the kind of subtle sometimes perhaps not so subtle pitfalls of psychedelic drug 
sc well sometimes i get the impression that people who are advocates for this really think that not just 
something new about their brains or their selves but about the nature of reality and very skeptical about that 
quite sure that the nature of reality is being revealed here rc no although they they might have some 
about the nature of nature possibly but then you also have a lot of pseudoscience that comes into this 
a lot of magical notions and a lot of contradiction that you hear as well people will talk about 
the western approach and the scientific analytical approach and how so reductionist and then bring up some loose idea 
the vagus nerve responsible for kundalini and just all really vague and horribly reductionist as well sc yeah rc 
there is some annoying contradictions sc okay speaking of the western scientific method here doing experiments why you describe 
an actual experiment you would do on a patient by giving them some psychedelic and looking at looking their 
somehow rc yeah okay we have been doing some interesting work with dmt injecting it into people and then 
to volunteers i presume yeah rc to healthy volunteers and then recording their brain activity with eeg these caps 
record the oscillatory activity in the brain look a little bit like swimming caps with sensors on and then 
as well and recently completed a simultaneous eegfmri study one of my phd students chris timmermann has been leading 
work and so quite pioneering and it allows us to bring together the high temporal resolution of eeg with 
high special resolution of fmri look at things like complex patterns in the temporal activity look actually literally at 
complexity at its entropy but also look at brain networks and their dynamics rc and there are some principles 
emerging out of that and then really as good science perhaps or just science does it throws up interesting 
questions and future studies to think about so some way through in fact the plan is to begin this 
the next month in february to begin a protocol well actually begin the experiments themselves following a continuous infusion 
with dmt so typically we give a bolus of dmt and it rockets people into this dmt space where 
feel so profoundly immersed in this other world that feels as real as this one but is sc zero 
sixty very very quickly rc yeah yeah and is content rich visually incredibly rich that kind of avatartype scene 
probably sc floating cities yeah rc yeah from ayahuasca and dmt visions but that kind of thing and people 
report encountering entities seemingly sentient other beings in this dmt world sc which is not what you would see 
lsd rc no not really no it quite reach that intensity sc lsd i think you mentioned is more 
the things that you do see are altered instead of seeing new things rc yeah more of a distortion 
there can be sort of perhaps richer deeper notions and memories personal material and transpersonal material can emerge under 
over a longer time frame and so therapeutically those longerlasting psychedelics like lsd and psilocybin oral psilocybin yeah different 
that sense more therapeutic gain to be had whereas dmt iv or smoked dmt is more like this short 
blast into this other very weird hyperreal space sc so how short is short a typical trip last rc 
less than twenty minutes sc less than twenty minutes okay but meeting other sentient beings rc yes and people 
back and their sc which you and i like to think are made up in brains not not angels 
down in this thing rc what an exciting opportunity for studying the archetypes i think and the dynamic fabric 
suppose of the unconscious mind that was what lured me into this space it was that very thing really 
i first got into this area and yeah obviously a huge challenge but the opportunity sc just some people 
not going to be experts here these are not thought to be addictive drugs that giving to people rc 
sc so when you get volunteers pretty sure that safe doing these kind of experiments rc yeah so we 
go through some of the obvious things toxicity profile seems to be very good especially with a compound like 
magic mushrooms massive therapeutic index which is the dose that you would typically take or you might take therapeutically 
to a dose going to cause you harm or kill you massive window there sc right so not like 
little bit extra is going to really cause you harm rc no whereas there are many medicines where a 
tighter therapeutic licensed a much tighter therapeutic index and legal drugs like alcohol very small well no sc maybe 
little bit chuckle rc yeah and then we can look at yeah mortality risk no risk to your physiology 
this going to kill you at least with a compound like psilocybin then we can look at addiction potential 
addiction potential animals selfadminister psychedelics they seem if anything to be fundamentally aversive and humans only really go there 
they can make mistakes and try and take them for recreation for fun but then they get a rude 
and they realize that true these party drugs and they have taken lsd at the party sc yeah rc 
so more drugs that are sort of selfexploration when taken in the right way and then people often do 
explorations quite sparingly they might do it a couple of times a year if they consider themselves a psychedelic 
sc my impression is that really no standard across which alcohol should be readily available but lsd should be 
really no danger that you get from lsd that you also get in much worse rc a behavioral danger 
think it sc okay rc yeah sc what kind of behavioural danger rc well if if on a high 
of lsd or psilocybin and confused and things are distorted and all this powerful emotional material is coming up 
probably be wandering around in an urban center where traffic and such like sc or maybe in a position 
responsibility for other people something like that rc yeah with your children or something yeah sc not good rc 
are some risks there and also the psychological vulnerability which should be considered a risk and for that reason 
strongly emphasized and so important that it is that the psychedelic be taken in the right kind of context 
that involves not just the context for the immediate experience but also ahead of time that you come into 
experience with some intention and preparation and forethought and also some planning for the aftercare as well the landing 
so if those things are covered then all of a sudden one could make quite a rational case for 
think opening up access to safe use of psychedelics within certain centers for example sc when you bring patients 
do you give them some sort of psychological test to make sure in a good place to do this 
of experiment rc yeah we do we do careful screening of course if patients often not in a good 
sc i say patients but volunteers for the experiment or something yeah rc yeah yeah if they are in 
period of psychological distress then if a healthy volunteer study they would be excluded because it starts to blur 
causality i suppose rc yeah and the lines between a healthy volunteer study and a patient study sure one 
question that distinction anyway but if your question is does a certain psychedelic work in the you probably want 
blur that with some kind of therapeutic study sc yeah okay and you mentioned aldous huxley before he famously 
was it lsd as he was dying he was dying of cancer it was very very painful he asked 
be administered lsd and apparently it made his passing much gentler and more pleasant is that one of the 
therapeutic uses endoflife care that we might imagine rc yeah it is yeah and so nyu and johns hopkins 
done some really important work there charlie grob at ucla and peter gasser in switzerland so quite a few 
and probably most of the recent clinical trials and actually the best designed clinical trials have been these studies 
endoflife distress with doubleblind randomized control trials the gold standard for clinical trials in terms of scientific rigor those 
and yeah there the results have been very compelling so rapid and enduring improvements in the main mental health 
which have been depressive and anxiety symptoms so very quick and lasting reductions in those and so to put 
more of a human spin on it people report feeling much more at ease with the inevitable their inevitable 
and they view death their death perhaps even death more generally as something not to be so frightened of 
i presume there are a sort of moralistic attitude in some people that that would be bad that you 
be resisting death no matter what and therefore you should face it as naturally as possible but very much 
the camp that it is something that you should try to come to terms with right come to peace 
rc yeah well inevitable and perhaps sc it happens to all of us rc yeah some grace to dying 
and some humility but sure rage rage against the dying light and all that kind of thing but yeah 
that often is it the loved one who want you to pass but maybe true compassion in saying want 
to pass and yeah very very human work in that space and universally relevant as well sc well you 
this idea of taking psychedelics in a controlled environment a few times a year or whatever what do you 
as the longterm good balance about how this stuff is used so you take lsd before you go to 
party that seems to be something that you were saying but what do you think is the correct social 
for these kinds of things if you were the boss of the world and could set all the rules 
well there are some red flags yeah take them at a party be mindful about the dosage that you 
take them for escape a really important one sc i think it is an important one worth emphasizing it 
you right rc yeah sc still facing yourself rc you are and everything underneath the sort of egoself sc 
maybe facing yourself more clearly rc yeah yeah and that can be really where the terror comes sc eyeopening 
rc yeah and so for me i think the rollout would be the centers where there is regulation i 
so the decriminalization initiatives that are going on at the moment are interesting and you can make the argument 
people be punished or even incarcerated for exploring their own consciousness and such like and perhaps even doing therapeutic 
that could turn their lives around in a healthy way perhaps make them better citizens you know so sure 
could argue that but is decriminalization really the right way for this to roll out i think initiatives that 
thinking more carefully about the rollout of psychedelic therapy whether that be the plant medicines themselves or the product 
the classic regulatory route well obviously in my view they are much more thoughtful and a much healthier way 
this can roll out rc and there the vision the shared vision is of centers that are carefully managed 
managed where you have key ingredients like careful screening of people coming in for vulnerabilities to identify those red 
you know if on the cusp of a psychotic break perhaps they be taking a big dose of psilocybin 
could tip the balance in a negative way and yeah to have mental health professionals there and to take 
of the preparation and the supervision during the experience that people are in a very safe container with ingredients 
ingredients in that space that we think are important like music and carefully crafted music and then the aftercare 
well rc and if those things are in place actually my view and i mind saying this these days 
the access to that model could be very broad not just people who have you know fit into whatever 
category but maybe people who are well as well that could be benefit from still the effect on their 
wellbeing how it might help keep them well and have other subtle advantages in terms of living well and 
connected to other people sc i think i mean an interesting angle to go down to imagine that intelligent 
of psychedelics could just be part of living mentally well like keeping up your own mental health is that 
that makes sense rc yes it does it does and a huge case to be made there where the 
of mental illness is so massive that you can make a case around prophylaxis or preventative measures that can 
things like resilience the ability to have some flex when times get really tough help put things in sc 
again these are hopefully effects that are not just while on the trip but can linger on afterward rc 
these are yeah afterwards really and there again tying the psychedelic experience in with other things that are healthy 
healthy living healthy diet cultivating a healthy attitude healthy literature in a sense and practices maybe things like meditation 
where the rollout could work best i think sc it does sound like something that would be hard to 
scientifically and how much do we know even if you can do an fmri study to see which parts 
the brain are lighting up how much do we know about the longterm mental health benefits of being or 
these experiences rc well we can look at other studies we can look at population studies we can do 
studies where we track people over an extended period and we started doing those so we set up what 
believe will be a incredibly valuable resource already valuable but i think the future is going to be really 
for it called psychedelicsurveycom and through that we try and collect naturalistic data in a prospective way so that 
that we collect data before the psychedelic trip and afterwards as well rather than just doing the classic survey 
which is to collect everything in retrospect rc and there you make any inferences about causality and such like 
is about tracking people and ideally tracking big numbers so we can get big data and then the great 
of big data is that you can see trends that are otherwise quite difficult to see you know very 
a popular topic in medicine and science more generally at the moment big data so yeah and there picking 
some obvious red flags at the moment and different variables that predict responses but the kind of thing needed 
high throughput if going to be able to best mitigate risks and learn how to optimize delivery of psychedelic 
sc and what are if one thing so ordinary healthy people we all have neuroses we all have things 
can be better at so maybe this is part of our mental healthcare regime or regimen what are the 
obvious mental health problems that people have for which psychedelics might be the part of the cure rc well 
you know this is a space where psychedelics where the buzz surrounding psychedelics now is warranted i feel because 
so long people probably motivated by the drugs industry have been looking for magic bullets that can come in 
target specific diagnoses with specific chemical actions sc and then be cured rc yeah and the reality is that 
sc not like that yeah rc no not like that and so with psychedelic therapy sure early phase data 
are just small pilot studies really but improving and you know soon going to be some really compelling data 
there but part of the picture is that a lot of different indications a lot of different disorders that 
are showing signal for depression treatmentresistant depression anxiety endoflife distress addictions in different varieties drinking alcohol tobacco now eating 
okay rc so starting a trial this year hopkins have already started we think chronic pain others think chronic 
too the psychological aspects of pain we think could be quite effectively treated with psychedelic therapy obsessive compulsive disorder 
preliminary data on that and so short of wanting to sound like selling a panacea necessary to try and 
why this might be the case that psychedelic therapy has what we call a transdiagnostic action sc right not 
single thing for which good rc yeah not a single indication that it works for there seems to be 
lot sc i do want i forgot to emphasize this possibility of treating addiction because of course i think 
the popular imagination drugs are addicting but in fact psychedelics seem to be useful in curing people that from 
addicted to other drugs is that right rc yeah right yeah so an interesting paradox quite a few things 
should really challenge sc and maybe this is part of the jumping out of a rut cognitively rc yes 
is it and this brings us to the explanation of why psychedelic therapy could be transdiagnostic in action in 
a lot of these disorders involve ruts you know whether behavioral ruts sc depression especially rc yeah behavioral ruts 
is very true in that sense in that a gravitational pull to the object of relief whatever it is 
the withdrawal and all the uncertainty and turmoil when not there you know and then with depression matt johnson 
psychedelic therapy could be useful for addiction broadly defined and i quite like that because in a sense in 
depression the addiction if you want is the pessimism becomes so practiced so habitual so heavily weighted the gravitational 
is so strong that like a literal depression it pulls you in into that rut and then hard to 
out and if out vulnerable to falling back in again and so with psychedelic therapy the therapeutic mechanism we 
is that almost if the landscape if you have a literal depression like a hole that starts to yeah 
rut flattens and now the flatter you can explore you can move more freely you can see more the 
up you can see outside of the hole and all the possibilities there sc sometimes increasing entropy is useful 
rc absolutely yeah controlled increase in entropy sc i mean the lesson that learning from all of this is 
a wellfunctioning brain or mind is kind of all about the balance right between a little bit of organization 
little bit of freedom a little bit of randomness and sometimes that balance gets out of whack and maybe 
can push us in one direction when appropriate rc yeah and probably a universal principle that goes beyond mental 
and the brain of destruction breeding new organization that in some way is better in inverted commas sc so 
just to wrap things up i mean what is the scientific frontier what is it what you want to 
being done at labs like yours if a pioneer here what do you want to see being done around 
world what do we need to understand about the relationship between psychedelics and the brain for example rc yeah 
couple of things to say i think a demystification process where there is this pitfall around magical thinking and 
coming into this space i think be so actually sound paradoxical but on a spiritual level to understand going 
in this aspect of nature the human brain when people have these very profound spiritual experiences under psychedelics and 
will be hugely pioneering and progressive for understanding the brain and the mind and spiritual experiences and i think 
a lot of healthy implications be some resistance to it i think a shame but i confident that the 
approach will win out i mean it has historically sc right rc and so there will be this healthy 
which is good paradoxically for spiritual practice i would say so i hope that plays out and another thing 
that i hope that the mainstream push back too hard but embraces this but a lot of areas in 
psychedelic therapy and psychedelic science pushes against convention so many whether depth psychology oh well been a dominant force 
psychology and neuroscience for a long time so challenging and then drugs not cup of tea so we have 
work around the fact that these are drugassisted psychotherapies and we put aside our biases whether towards biomedical models 
psychotherapy models and try and talk to each other and get on with this hybrid biopsychosocial model and what 
do we have rc well as i say mental health itself and the stigma there and then i think 
lot of conventions in mainstream science and psychiatry and medicine that could be challenged with psychedelic therapy like the 
that you do a traditional clinical trial where you pick out a specific indication you constrain everything around these 
and exclusion criteria and then because usually of financial reasons you run a very small trial that throws up 
limited data set in terms of its richness rc whereas if you could set up a trial that perhaps 
at a range of different indications or a very broad population say healthies all the way up to depressed 
all the neuroticism in between and yeah the same intervention but maybe you can allow some adaptability in the 
maybe the dose the dosage and the dosing sessions and maybe also the integration care and the therapeutic models 
be tweaked and played with so consistent with called an adaptive trial and also the idea of a broad 
is consistent with called a basket or basket trial where putting a lot of different things in the same 
with the same intervention sc oh yeah okay rc so that kind of done in oncology where you would 
a number of different cancers with the same intervention why not psychiatry one of the reasons why not probably 
it slightly flies in the face or it seems to of this fashion around precision medicine people will say 
precision but i think a lot to be said for the exploration and the benefits that can come from 
liberal explorative approach to the science at this stage particularly as quite young science sc somehow fifty years of 
opportunity because been difficult to do this research rc yeah yeah it is and so a huge amount to 
done and i think the progress will benefit if we constrain things too heavily sc but it sounds like 
that things are changing and going to start using this stuff more intelligently rc yeah very optimistic of course 
can be jackknifed when looking in one direction with optimism and then something comes along and really pushes back 
yet to happen and we seen what going to look like it probably will happen but what gives me 
is the conviction in the model and the value of the tool sc alright robin carhartharris thanks so much
