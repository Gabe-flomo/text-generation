transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and you know if 
longtime listener that i tend to mix things up from week to week the episodes are not really related 
each other for the most part but this episode can in some sense be thought of as a philosophical 
piece to last episode last week we had max tegmark talking about the mathematical multiverse sc today we have 
hall a philosopher in fact chair of the philosophy department at harvard university done absolutely important work on causality 
the laws of nature and also on the idea of possible worlds the philosopher david lewis who was very 
in philosophy circles although less wellknown to the general public examined this idea of all possible worlds and how 
could be related to each other not physically not sort of causally but the different ways in which they 
from each other and how those ways entered into our analysis of counterfactual conditions examining possibilities that actually come 
in our universe sc so i talk with ned about causation and the laws of physics as i said 
how we analyze these ideas in the context of imagining all the different possible universes out there now lewis 
that all the different possible universes were actually real that they actually existed very close to max idea of 
mathematical universe where every mathematical structure actually exists sc but a little bit different i think you can actually 
the idea of possible worlds in a way that necessitate that you believe that all real but whatever your 
on that is going to get there today this is a wonderful conversation ned is just a true genius 
taking esoteric philosophical ideas and bringing them down to earth and making them very understandable so go music sc 
hall thanks for being on the mindscape podcast ned hall oh delighted sc a real honest philosopher which i 
it in some sense is it unfair to think of what philosophers do as taking sort of the common 
questions we all have and then taking them superduper seriously and digging into them nh i think fair i 
fair sometimes questions will arise along the way that you anticipate and that have any clear common sense analog 
some of these questions you know about so if we were talking about foundations of quantum mechanics we could 
questions like do you get a world of middlesized dry goods that seem to have a kind of relatively 
geometrical arrangement in space out of something as weird as a quantum mechanical wave sc yeah i wish the 
would take that question a lot more seriously than they do but yeah philosophers are definitely there but it 
with looking at an object and going nh right yeah so even that question you could think goes back 
a question that i gather was very prominent in aristotle you pick something out in the world familiar and 
ask is and a certain way of asking that question where you have in mind a certain kind of 
so if i point to that book on the table and ask is not answering the question appropriately if 
say copy of this right sc it capture the essence somehow nh right right sc right capturing the essence 
things so many questions that we could start with but i know the one that written about quite a 
and also i am personally interested in is the idea of causation or causality cause and effect what is 
favorite word there causation causality nh ecumenical sc okay nh i used to be for some reason i have 
idea why but i used to bristle when people said i know why chuckle nh like not the way 
learned but the same thing sc yeah okay good so roughly speaking in our everyday lives in the folk 
we have of the world the manifest image we are always talking about causes and effect nh yeah sc 
sick because i had bad or whatever and therefore the philosophers like to analyze this so why is it 
hard what are the mysteries that pop up when we try to ask do you mean by nh oh 
so there are mysteries i think along a number of different axes so one of them we might get 
later if we talk about laws of nature but when we talk about cause and effect that kind of 
goes along with other kind of talk like talk of the powers of things so for example suppose you 
a headache and you take some ibuprofen and your headache goes away and you say it went away because 
took the ibuprofen we would happily add ibuprofen has the power or capacity to cure and that talk of 
and capacities seems to introduce a dimension to our sort of picture of the world different from the dimension 
on when we simply give a kind of blowbyblow account of what happened where and when sc it does 
to add nh right right right sc over and above the stuff nh something that in some sense knits 
together and for a philosopher like like the candle to the sc knitting things together yeah nh sometimes you 
burned you know we want to understand what is that knitting together and find in the history of philosophy 
different views about this some people think like right we just have to think of the world as really 
two the kind of aspect again that we get at when we simply report what happens where and when 
we fill out our encyclopedia of the occurrences that make up the world and then the aspect we get 
when we say things like causes or has the power to do or ultimately if we translate this into 
language of modern physics are the fundamental laws that govern what so there are some people philosophers and nonphilosophers 
who think really you need a twofactor view of what reality is like kind of the stuff that happens 
then there are the necessities the powers sc okay yeah nh or the necessary connections sc right as a 
i will play the role today of the hardboiled physicist since the philosopher in the room i think i 
just get along with just the stuff doing things and the rest is commentary in some sense is that 
fair attitude nh yeah the question is whether you think how you think about that commentary so there is 
kind of view which has a long tradition which says a kind of commentary on that stuff which should 
thought of as a kind of conceptual grid we impose on the way we think about the stuff that 
but a kind of mistake to think that that conceptual grid is latching on to some structure out there 
right it really is a little bit extra in some sense nh yeah yeah yeah sc yeah but okay 
then another point of view which says no that a fundamental feature of the world which are these powers 
guess nh right right right right and sometimes you can bring out the difference fairly clearly by thinking of 
really really simple scenarios so imagine a scenario like this like a that looks like this got two newtonian 
in it and they orbit around each other things the initial conditions are set up just right so they 
around each other in perfect circular motion thanks to the gravitational attraction between them so got mass no charge 
only force there is the gravitational force between them sc and since newtonian not even gravitational waves so they 
do this forever nh right right right right and it seems like i could describe that scenario in a 
different way i could ask you to imagine a world in which there are particles and each particle just 
a very very simple boring law that really permits no interaction between them every particle simply orbits in a 
motion have to imagine that something moving relative to like absolute space just spot that so that we can 
what it is to be sc in a nh in a circular orbit without reference to other material objects 
this alternative way to describe this one law it governs every particle individually every particle just moves for all 
in a circular orbit and someone who thinks that talk of necessary connections or powers or causes or laws 
a kind of valuable useful grid that we impose on the phenomena will look at this and say these 
two alternative ways you might have of describing exactly the same sc yeah nh so there really is no 
difference between these two possible worlds at all and of course not really any practical need served by describing 
one way or another because the world is so simple sc such a simple world right nh right right 
no prospect of being in that world and describing it chuckle sc there are no people in there to 
about it right yeah nh right right right yeah i say these are smart particles chuckle nh and someone 
the other side will say no no all the difference in the world as it were between these two 
one the way they might try to bring that out is they might ask you to consider hypotheticals pertaining 
the worlds they might say something true of the newtonian world if there were a third particle somehow introduced 
motions going forward would no longer be which is almost certainly right have to better at this than i 
you would have to set things up just right to still preserve circular motion sc right nh whereas in 
other world where just a simple law that applies to all particles separately if you introduced a third particle 
by stipulation it too would move in a circular motion and so for people on this side of this 
that talking about it will simply be obvious that there has to be a difference between these two worlds 
a difference in what would be the case were a certain thing to happen and then you you could 
predict how this will go people on the other side will say look that conceptual grid that talking about 
on reality is quite rich it includes talk of laws and causes and talk of sc yeah possible worlds 
another aspect of the grid sc yes yeah yes nh and so all doing is drawing attention to the 
that the grid we impose has this rich conceptual structure but you yet convinced me that that structure is 
to anything really out there in the world nh a little bit difficult even to think too deeply at 
level about this very simple example simply because so simple and we inevitably think about those two particles as 
they were part of our much richer world and that it enables us in some sense to ask these 
questions whereas the particles themselves could never ask these chuckle nh right right right right right so a different 
of example you could think about that connects much more to our world as we experience it although to 
the example i have to take sides on debates in the foundations of quantum mechanics in sc go ahead 
no sc used to that laughter nh in particular how we should think about probability so as i know 
familiar there are approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics that say that the fundamental dynamical laws are stochastic 
it were if we write down the equations that govern how things evolve those equations have probabilities written right 
them and you explain away those probabilities as a reflection of our ignorance about initial conditions or anything like 
so just grant for the sake of argument sc imagine nh yeah or imagine that the correct description of 
world obviously we know quantum mechanics has to be fixed but we imagine any way of fixing it up 
going to preserve this irreducibly probabilistic component so then you could ask how do you think about that probabilistic 
if on one side or the other of this so for people who think that the world has this 
dimension many of them are just happy to include a probabilistic dimension as well and that that stance will 
certain concrete ramifications for example if on that side of this divide i think just in addition to the 
about what happens where and when there are these facts among other things about i will think that while 
that those probabilities are reflected in observable frequencies no guarantee of that sc you could get luckyunlucky right nh 
we could get unlucky we might be unlucky whereas if i think that no talk of probabilities is just 
component of this conceptual grid i have no particular reason to grant that possibility not even clear what it 
mean for me to say we could be unlucky sc in the sense that the probability is nothing other 
the frequency with nh yeah yeah yeah and you have to be careful about how you spell out that 
because you know we could ask embarrassing questions like which frequencies determine the probabilities i think those kinds of 
ultimately can be answered but the overall approach would be one that said talk of probabilities is a way 
kind of encapsulate in a mathematically elegant form a whole ton of information about frequencies or it might be 
that we yet have so we could say our current best guess about what those frequencies will be sc 
getting the impression my plan was to start with causality and go to other places but getting the impression 
there are so many other things we need to think about before we really do causality right that maybe 
should finish with causality and talk more about things like the nature of the laws of physics when you 
about laws introduced these concepts of powers or propensities as a physicist i hear philosophers talking about these but 
our language as physicists so what are the different ways that we have of thinking about what you mean 
a law of nature or a law of physics nh good so one approach squarely in the conceptual grid 
that sees talk of laws as earning its keep because of the way that concept of law helps us 
our view of the world sc so can i just rephrase that as a bunch of things happening we 
patterns within it and a way of encapsulating everything nh yes yes and let me try to give an 
that may be kind of familiar and easier to get a handle on imagine a mathematician and you do 
theory and what are you trying to do when you do number theory well prove interesting results about the 
we have some background view that certain results would be interesting to prove and certain other ones not so 
to prove not clear where those judgments come from sc why you think that right nh yes but okay 
can just say we tend to agree on interesting and not like theorem is interesting like how many are 
the decimal expansion of two by two by two by two by two by two is not interesting and 
also tend to agree on which statements about arithmetic are obvious maybe obvious enough that we would not feel 
to be any more confident of them just because we prove them from other statements kind of starting point 
as it were and over time we hit upon a small set of those obvious statements that seem to 
a very effective job for us of organizing our mathematical practice what do i mean by organizing our mathematical 
well when i claim to have a proof of something you can say can you show me how to 
that proof from our small set of starting point sc yeah nh and maybe we would ask other things 
those statements as well we want them to be powerful enough that we think plausible or at least a 
hypothesis working hypothesis to think that we can use them to establish or refute sc okay so these statements 
axioms or assumptions nh yup yup yup sc i want to to leap ahead nh so that was i 
being sneaky about it that was the reveal that this is sc sorry i gave it up sorry nh 
no fine you gave it up at the right just the right moment this is a view about what 
is for something to be an axiom sc okay nh and a view anthropocentric in a certain way we 
find these things obvious or epistemically powerful powerful with respect to their ability to establish or refute the claims 
care about maybe there are other desiderata we have as well but not out there in the mathematical universe 
we imagine like platonists and we think a universe of mathematical truths not that some of them somehow shine 
brightly as like being the fundamental truths sc yeah okay that makes sense as long as a truth a 
nh yeah yeah so this is a little capsule story about the rationale for us humans who are interested 
number theory to single out certain statements as axioms and it can be used to justify a choice of 
and we could all agree that in certain senses objective what the axioms are what do i mean by 
well i mean we find ourselves agreeing on a good choice things could have turned out differently you could 
a race of creatures who can think about numbers but vast disparity between those creatures as to which statements 
the numbers they find obvious sc nh like you think two two four is what are you thinking sean 
but maybe you can maybe you think you can imagine those people but maybe really every set of rational 
would agree nh yeah yeah and which is an interesting conjecture maybe now getting into really deep waters sc 
nh maybe something about the nature of rational thought itself that it grounds or explains why we find some 
or some not and that would be very cool if someone could establish that sc yeah nh but even 
not the case that need to be a threat we could still say look enough for us to have 
agreed upon way of organizing our view of the world and i like that as an analogy for the 
that this one i might as well give them a label call them humeans after david hume sc good 
he was this scottish philosopher who famously denied that there are any real necessary connections in the world sc 
hume is on the side like a bunch of stuff happening nh yeah sc and we impose some way 
talking about it nh yeah yeah yeah sc love it chuckle nh yeah yeah yeah and so one way 
go and then a number of interesting questions arise what is the best way to organize our view of 
world the example of axioms is is maybe overly simple in some respects a little too easy to spot 
interests of ours that are served by singling out axioms whereas when it comes to laws of nature there 
all sorts of interests that might be served now lot of things that people on the call them the 
side would say in response but i think one place to focus which is a place that many of 
will want to put pressure is on a particular use that we put concepts like the law of nature 
which is in explanations of phenomena not just predictions but explanations and here you can see that the analogy 
mathematics is beginning to weaken and maybe break down sc yeah this is a more sciencebased question nh yeah 
right i think there is such a thing as explanation in mathematics presumably mathematicians in your audience are going 
be nodding vigorously here but not the same as scientific explanation in scientific explanation it actually looks like one 
that we do routinely in giving scientific explanations is talk about not just what happens but what would have 
if things had been different in certain ways so a nice example and you can correct me if got 
physics wrong on this but my understanding of newton is that in the principia when he argued for the 
force law for gravity sc gravity in yeah nh right the argument was not that it was this law 
opposed to alternatives like maybe the force varies directly with r or with cubed or something else the argument 
not look squared gives you elliptical true that it does and true that other forces but and this is 
have this on the authority of my spies not read the principia so audience go and check at the 
that newton was writing the empirical data was not precise enough to distinguish an ellipse from the other sorts 
curves that would have been given by other force laws sc well pretty sure that it was good enough 
distinguish between that and cubed nh yeah it might be right yeah sc but there are others but i 
right there are things that would have done just as good a job empirically yeah nh yeah however the 
law gives you a different prediction if got other planets in the solar system besides the earth which is 
the axis of the ellipse as a planet goes around the sun you just focus on the long axis 
the ellipse there it traces out that axis itself rotates over time which it if the other planets there 
notice what i just said there would be no precession of these orbits i think the right term if 
other planets now so say it again newton puts us in a position to evaluate a hypothetical if there 
been no other planets then this orbit would not have precessed and that actually looks like an explanation of 
precession of the orbits and it looks like an explanation that cites not just facts about what does happen 
facts about what would have happened and how do we make sense of that nh well thankfully according to 
antihumeans got laws to appeal to and those laws actually dictate not just facts about what happens sort of 
ontologically robust than that they dictate facts about what would have happened and they are what allow us to 
of use these counterfactuals in a rigorous and controlled fashion and we need to use them because otherwise we 
anything and i think behind this is a much sort of more fundamental so maybe fundamental in the sense 
slightly murky thought which is that to explain phenomena in the world not enough simply to add to your 
of them your kinda blowbyblow description of their surroundings say but to explain why something is the case you 
to give information about what it constrains it to be that way sc and so i think that building 
to or maybe already achieved the motivation of the antihumean viewpoint but as a humean should i really be 
by any of this i could contemplate subjunctive situations counterfactual i can ask like what would have happen under 
circumstances so in other words as a humean i think i can look at the actual world distill laws 
it and then use those laws to say what would have happened in other circumstances so what am i 
by this antihumean addition nh well you can do that you might think that you could if you wanted 
describe those hypothetical situations with reference to any of a number of candidate laws as long as those laws 
on the facts on what actually happens all as far as the world is concerned equally good in the 
way that different axiomatizations of arithmetic are equally good as far as the mathematical truths are concerned like you 
to include in an axiom a mathematical falsehood but as long as you got truths math care the only 
on the choice in the case of mathematics seems to be that we care about using some more than 
because it suits our purposes but it can sound awkward to think that which explanatory counterfactuals are true is 
relative to our purposes and interests in marking out certain claims as the laws rather than others sc okay 
think getting it actually so remarkably in real time but test me on this so if a true humean 
i think that the socalled laws of nature are just convenient encapsulations of what actually happens in our actual 
that makes it harder to talk about other possible worlds right how do i know which features of our 
to extend to those worlds nh yeah and you can stipulate that you can say my present purposes going 
stipulate that the possible worlds going to consider are all worlds in which the following statements are and now 
sort of write down the things that treating as laws and if got a stipulation like that then okay 
the worry that the antihumean has with this approach is that the stipulation seems like governed by questions about 
to us whereas explanatory genuinely explanatory be governed by those questions i can give you another example sort of 
what you think about this but another example that we could think see as like an intuition pump this 
a phrase philosophers like to use to try and sort of tempt you over to the dark side of 
nh so imagine that some number of years from now imagining kind of a utopian future where world harmony 
solved global warming and all human resources are now devoted to doing fundamental physics all realized what a great 
that is so no wars but just like lots of fundamental physics sc everyone gets a job nh yeah 
sc all the postdocs you want yeah nh and reached the point where we realize that in order to 
the two sort of remaining candidates for what the correct theory of fundamental physics is like we need to 
this super collider that rings the equator so that we can achieve high enough energies and so on and 
built it and got the test set up and we realized that the experiment going to run is going 
achieve conditions that we can plausibly say have never been achieved in the history of the cosmos and absent 
intervention on this case will never be achieved unless some other intelligence out there who does this so these 
unique conditions and now someone sort of comes rushing in as about to fire up the experiment and says 
wait wait wait stop everything just done some calculations got these two theories a and b if theory a 
correct the test will go beautifully and in fact will give us results that will show us that theory 
is correct but we been careful enough in working out the ramifications of theory b if theory b is 
this test will set off a new big sc this is uncomfortably close to arguments people actually had when 
turned on the large hadron collider laughter sc so this is not such a thought experiment yeah nh right 
now if an antihumean how you will think about the practical situation we face you will think is just 
fact of the matter about which laws are of course we could have gotten everything wrong we could have 
unlucky and deceived and really theory c correct but done our job well and so we have entitlement to 
that the true fundamental laws are either a or b and just a fact like you know given independently 
what happens as long as what happens is consistent with them a kind of behind the scenes the rules 
the game are either the a rules or the b rules and we simply know which are the correct 
yet and so we can reason if they are the b rules for all we know they are the 
rules and so maybe we want to be cautious and not run the experiment for all we know we 
destroy the world or at least start it over without us in it sc something like that right nh 
if a humean and you think that what laws are are simply something like highly useful summaries of what 
really hard to know how to think about this if we do the experiments then remember i said that 
experiment is going to achieve conditions that are unique in the history of the world if we run the 
then there will be no such conditions to as it were include in the summary sc no facts to 
irregularity about nh right right so it looks like you ought to say we do the experiment then simply 
whether the laws are the a laws or the b but not the way we would actually think about 
so a humean could say right our thinking is infected by a kind of certain antihumean and some humeans 
actually point to history here say if you look at how physics arose in say that and century it 
against the kind of theological background so someone like newton would have happily said writing down the laws literally 
into the mind of god like laws are and if you had that view a very antihumean view sc 
the most antihumean you can get i presume yes nh yeah yeah chuckle but the humean might say we 
have outgrown so in offering this thought experiment partly offering it just i think fun to think about you 
to do that as a philosopher laughter nh but i mean to be suggesting somehow decisive in favor of 
antihumean but it does show i think that a kind of deepseated component in the way we think about 
world that the antihumean is latching on to sc yeah it evidence against the antihumean view that there is 
famous champion whose name we can attach to this view like we can for the humean view laughter nh 
right i suppose an antihumean might say just because sc every smart person agrees i guess nh exactly yeah 
why are we calling it the humean view what does david hume have to say about this nh well 
famously hume as you mentioned before did deny that there are any real necessities in nature and for reasons 
fully understand now kind of the historical standard bearer for that view i say that because usually in philosophy 
you find some philosopher famous for advocating some interesting idea you can find some predecessor sc yeah no yeah 
nh hume too it has to stop somewhere sc right nh but hume was relatively late in the day 
own approach was kind of interesting and detailed and well thoughtout enough to have a lasting impact he added 
to the mix that we really talked about which is a kind of view that we humans naturally tend 
project kind of features of our psychology out into the world so one example that might be familiar or 
kind of easy to grasp is color we see the world as colored maybe it is but maybe it 
just like atoms and electrons moving around reflecting light in a certain way sc yeah i mean sorry explain 
little bit more what it would mean for it not to be colored i mean like you said we 
color but saying not to be colored in the sense that just an illusion or just an emergent phenomenon 
what do you mean nh the view imagining here which i mean to be endorsing but just have it 
the table is that it is an illusion although unlike other illusions like seeing a stick in water that 
bent or something like that a highly serviceable and useful illusion sc right okay nh so if you had 
design a human being with a visual system in a way that where that visual system would help the 
being survive and environment sc color is very useful nh yeah sc yeah right nh but not really there 
thought sc okay nh so we could use that as an example very hard not to see the world 
genuinely colored but someone who thinks an illusion will be like the way our visual system works kind of 
we take the world to be colored kind of projecting something properly understood as a feature of the way 
respond sc well sorry when having this conversation what mindset should we be in do we know that there 
things called frequencies of light that correspond to different colors or are we sort of in a pre that 
nh right so this view got going pre that perspective but where advances in physics had gotten to the 
where the socalled natural philosophers who took this view about color were confident that the material world was just 
objects in space sc yeah okay nh yeah and when you bring in a more complex view of material 
where they have charge and where you know they come in different fundamental varieties in their photons and the 
properties of matter can make a difference to how that matter interacts with photons it opens up space for 
colors into the world as real elements sc but for purposes of this thought experiment honestly asking whether or 
colors are fundamental real things or just illusions okay good nh and so you might think like an example 
a projection it actually occurs to me as talking a much less controversial one might be our judgments about 
foods are disgusting sc yeah okay good nh so i have a constant argument with my family members about 
very ecumenical when it comes to food i like almost everything except beets as if all of my childhood 
aversions coalesce somewhere around age eighteen into beets sc well you know this might be exactly analogous to color 
it turns out that a lot of visceral reaction against certain foods can be traced to different taste receptors 
their tongues nh interesting sc something like of people really stand raw tomatoes nh oh interesting sc this is 
that is nh i feel so sorry for them sc well yeah number one you feel sorry for them 
not only do they not enjoy tomatoes but they get social approbation because of it like somehow flawed because 
enjoy tomatoes as much as they could but honestly just physiological difference nh right right whereas fortunately for me 
are enough of a fringe food that i suffer their approbation right but i enjoy getting these arguments where 
will say most people just understand how disgusting beets like i perceive the truth about beets but other people 
of course a joke right sc sure nh and for our purposes an illuminating joke because if i were 
serious i would be committing what you might call a projective error i would be taking my reaction to 
and somehow projecting it out into the beets as if what doing is simply passively picking up on this 
disgustingness sc yeah that beets have right nh yeah yeah sc okay and so sorry that is what hume 
us of doing nh yes with our talk of necessity in particular sc okay nh and here the reaction 
our own psychological habit of expecting things so if walking along and oh suppose you walk over a clear 
pane and a gap underneath it you will have a very strong psychological reaction to that sc yeah nh 
so just a vivid case but he thinks these reactions to the world these expectations that we build up 
time are legion and of course they are normally when i walk along i think about whether the ground 
remain stable under my feet just habituated into automatically expecting it will sc okay and good and so the 
to the laws of physics is that these habituations are sort of our fault not there in the world 
yeah yeah yeah and like the example of color hume thinks good for us that we become habituated in 
way sc right he know about evolution but so it selected darwinianly but he could at least say yeah 
a purpose being served by understanding that are colors and patterns in the world more broadly okay does this 
okay well this is definitely food for thought for me because i tend to be a proud humean on 
things but i think it could give me a good reason to wonder whether or not cheating when i 
about possible worlds in counterfactual situations this must be closely related to famous problem of induction how we go 
seeing n things to assuming that true for as well nh yeah yeah right and in the context of 
he was raising this point about as he saw it our tendency to project our expectations our habits of 
out onto the world as if just passively picking up the necessary connections that are out there he was 
concerned to try to show that as he would put it induction this kind of thing we do routinely 
indeed any kind of inference where we take some limited data about the world and extrapolate it it could 
towards the future could be towards the past could be towards the small scale could be towards the large 
any kind of extrapolation like that was for hume not rational nh for hume this point about projecting expectations 
part of a longer kind of investigation in which he was trying to argue i should say in a 
that was not received well by his contemporaries that our the kind of psychological processes we go through when 
extrapolate are not really an instance of reasoning sc oh okay what he said nh and going to sound 
to any scientist saying that not engaging in reasoning when i take in data and spend days or weeks 
months analyzing it sc so bring it down to earth what is an example of the kind of induction 
he has in mind that we are not reasoning about nh so a simple case might be we could 
back to something like experiments involving freely falling or rolling objects hume thinks that we feel guilty about the 
that after conducting those experiments we all find ourselves endorsing conclusion say that objects fall with a constant acceleration 
the surface of the earth but he thinks that we see that as a species of reasoning and the 
is clever and frustrating and to try to encapsulate it the key idea is that in extrapolating in a 
like that we seem to need to have as a background assumption some statement to the effect that nature 
a whole behaves in a uniform manner so before i go fill out the argument let me give a 
illustration so imagine that newton had a lesserknown brother call him newton was isaac call him schmisaac sc okay 
right what philosophers do when they want to introduce a character they just add to the front and schmisaac 
published his own version of the principia complete with a gravitational force law which had the feature that it 
that the force between any two massive objects is a constant times the product of their masses divided by 
square of the distance between them until the year say and then it just drops to zero and understandably 
paid attention to this sc yeah chuckle nh right you can see the trick here this is a way 
fashioning a force law that by design gives you the same predictions for any phenomena that presently in a 
to look at or test but differs outside the range that we have direct access sc falsifiable a good 
theory nh right but of course this be taken seriously now as a side note i will say when 
bring up this example in philosophy of science classes there are always a certain percentage of students who want 
say we just have to wait and right sc really they honestly do that nh yes honestly yeah yeah 
think we know sc just as good nh gravity work that way but we can wait until two thousand 
and find sc arguably karl popper thought that way right you just list every single possible thing that can 
and you chop them off one by one nh right right right and i think hume would have been 
impatient with this because he would have correctly pointed out that we need to make these inferences these extrapolations 
order to act in order to know how to act so if you were designing a probe to send 
mars you would design it under the assumption that gravity is going to continue to operate in the way 
has in the past sc not all of these hypotheses are equally plausible nh right right right but hume 
ask how do sc so sorry so on the one hand hume is pointing out that a bit of 
unsupported extrapolation on the other hand saying we gotta do nh right right right so an aspect of view 
here which is that he thinks human going to go out on a limb here hopefully there are no 
scholars in the audience but the way i read hume he thinks of human reason as sort of like 
something that serves us in a certain way and it can serve us better or worse but a mistake 
overinflate it so quite comfortable with saying you form a rational argument to extrapolate one way rather than another 
you will find yourself inevitably extrapolating one way rather than another and certain ways of extrapolating are better for 
than others sc a typical scientist not philosophically trained would just say but look the gravity is the same 
as it is today theory is just simpler therefore i have greater credence in wrong with that nh yes 
so the question that will now arise is how do we know on what basis are we confident that 
world operates according to simple principles and where argument becomes clever he observes that that very claim the world 
according to simple principles or as he would put it nature is uniform that looks like an empirical claim 
if you have the background attitude that any empirical claim about the world has to be substantiated by empirical 
but you also think that the very process of substantiation in order for that to get off the ground 
need to presuppose that nature operates according to simple principles or is uniform then it looks like running in 
circle here sc yeah a little bit nh famous presentation the argument for of the problem of induction rather 
so but the conclusion of it just to be very clear some people get this a little bit wrong 
that you do induction not that you extrapolate that the ground beneath you is shakier than you thought but 
gotta do it anyway nh right right and the way i like to think about it is you might 
thought that you could endorse with a clear conscience this principle that any empirical claim about the world should 
be believed if empirical evidence to back it up but if right we have to abandon that we have 
say something like certain empirical claims about the world that we give up on pain of just not knowing 
to extrapolate it all sc and arguably in some sense this line of i must be getting this wrong 
somehow this line of reasoning seems to be feeding into the argument you gave for being antihumean because in 
sense we would have more justification for doing these extrapolations if we attributed to the laws of nature some 
property over and above mere regularity as an idea nh a really a really interesting suggestion and a lot 
dispute within philosophy about that very question so there are some people in philosophy you in recent decades you 
find this argument very clearly presented in the work of say david armstrong deceased now but he was a 
influential australian philosopher who argued that unless we see laws as having some genuine power or force induction is 
not hume would say nonrational he say it was irrational with all the negative connotations that word has but 
philosophers will say we need real necessities in nature otherwise if we take seriously the alternative we should not 
anything about the future except beyond the bland statement will sc yeah okay go ahead nh the tricky question 
is whether problem is just going to rearise so one way to bring this out is against a theological 
so it would be one thing if we could say to ourselves we have independent reason to think that 
cosmos was created by a benevolent allpowerful and back in say day a lot of people did think they 
independent reason for that believing that at that rate it was probably not a good idea to deny that 
public laughter nh but if you had that view then you could say okay the laws of nature this 
back to what you were saying the ultimate antihumean view is this kind of theistic view you say there 
these laws of nature genuine rules and furthermore we should be confident that those rules are intelligible to us 
as where the rules were built with us at least somewhat in mind and that would give you a 
argument for thinking that the world is uniform or uniform enough for us to discover its principles because the 
is that god has this very kind of malicious or at least mischievous attitude nh subtle and also malicious 
right but the flip side work too in the modern perspective us being designed to understand the rules seems 
plausible well sorry the rules being designed for us to understand them seems less plausible than us being designed 
map onto the rules since we obey the rules right part of this world nh yeah nh so discovering 
about it is maybe not completely wildly implausible nh yeah yeah though an interesting question how far that kind 
perspective can take you if you have a theistic perspective you might be quite optimistic you might think can 
all the rules even the rules that govern phenomena at incredibly small scale or at energy scales that are 
large and so not the sort of thing we would ever whereas there is a worry that if you 
that we are designed our cognitive equipment is the sort of equipment that will get us around well in 
world well fine for catching causal relations and regularities at our scale but you might start to get uneasy 
great why should we think that the cognitive equipment that bequeathed us with is going to let us do 
gravity chuckle sc well as someone who tries to plump for the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics i 
the resistance because so different than what our intuition is and i try to make the argument that at 
level some point in the history of evolution we became too incomplete and we can do logic and then 
can just put aside not put aside our intuitions entirely but not rely on them entirely either and do 
little bit better nh right and so this brings us back to observation at least if correct that we 
to need to operate in the empirical domain with some background presumption that nature is uniform not going to 
out just from logic sc no absolutely not yeah okay nh and so if we ask well suppose we 
these antihumean laws but suppose just to continue with the theological metaphor that we imagine there are rules laid 
by a god but a god whose intentions we have no idea about at all like zero idea about 
plenty of people think that really tuned into intentions chuckle laughter sc but okay nh so this would be 
much more humble perspective like yes there is a god but who knows what she wants no idea whatsoever 
question looks like going to rearise why would we expect those rules to be what we would consider simple 
is it been doing a lot of the talking but just very curious of what your take is on 
theoretical physicists think about standards of simplicity sc well i was going to mention been taken for granted in 
circles that beauty simplicity elegance are guiding principles when looking for new theories of nature come under a bit 
criticism lately most notably by sabine hossenfelder who is a physicist who has been saying it for a while 
has said more loudly recently that been tricked by looking too much or trusting too much in elegance and 
and we do have this looming empirical fact about the world that we turned on the large hadron collider 
had what i thought and what most people thought were very good reasons to think that we would discover 
only the higgs boson but a proliferation of new particles all of those arguments were based on considerations of 
and simplicity and they were clearly wrong sc and so two ways to go either elegance and simplicity as 
as you thought or we got the elegance and simplicity wrong always a possibility so i think still most 
including myself think that elegance and simplicity are extremely helpful of course the data have the final say but 
extrapolating as you say into realms where you actually done the empirical tests yet of course you put the 
probability on the simplest thing going on nh right right and a very interesting observation one of the things 
i think is really fascinating about standards of elegance and simplicity is that they wear their content on their 
pretty clear what sorts of things would count as inelegant on any reasonable way of understanding that like my 
law but that may leave a fair amount of room within the things that could reasonably be viewed as 
and simple presumably a fair amount of room for maneuver sc well certainly comparing newtonian gravity and absolute spacetime 
general relativity the beauty is in the eye of the beholder a little bit and to someone who is 
up on tensor calculus general relativity can seem very far from elegant nh right right right so another aspect 
this discussion which is you may need to have a certain amount of sc relevant to your background knowledge 
this is a biased way to put it but you may need to have a certain amount of training 
appreciate elegance and simplicity there sc i think that many worlds is very elegant and simple not everyone agrees 
nh oh it is quite elegant and simple sc but well to be fair to them the connections we 
forced to draw between the underlying formalism and the world of experience are not very elegant and simple and 
if part of the theoretical framework then granted a mess nh yeah and a good point my only instinct 
think i have kind of oldfashioned rationalist instincts i would have been very comfortable in that humanistic setting and 
own instinct is to think that the principles of elegance and simplicity should be seen as good guides if 
at the level of fundamental physics and then from then on up things get messier and messier we might 
back to this when we talk about causation part of what makes causation such a vexed topic is that 
you scale up the kinds of relationships you can cleanly track become fewer and far between i think sc 
yeah start moving in that direction for the argument in favor of taking antihumeanism seriously it relied on various 
counterfactual situations and we tossed around the phrase and probably hume toss around that phrase or newton but become 
popular in recent decades in philosophy and was david lewis your advisor were you related to him somehow academically 
he was one of my mentors sc mentor okay nh he was not officially an advisor but someone that 
worked very closely with sc so explain to the audience why philosophers love to talk about possible worlds nh 
okay a complicated question there are all sorts of different reasons let me highlight a couple very different reasons 
reason is that possible worlds just seem like an interesting topic in their own right how did they become 
interesting topic well by a connection to something that we could already recognize if we go back to your 
comments as part of our basic way of thinking about the world that we seem to draw distinctions between 
could be the case and what has to be the case and for a philosopher just puzzling what is 
distinction sc yeah we draw it all the time without interrogating what we mean nh right and over the 
of the century probably starting somewhere in the a little hazy on the history here it came to seem 
we could clarify that question if we talked not directly in terms of possibility and necessity just using those 
but in terms of possible worlds where the intuitive conception of what a possible world is is a way 
reality as a whole could have been another way to put it which is a little more illuminating is 
possible world is something like a complete consistent story about the world sc and just as a footnote very 
than the many worlds of quantum mechanics which are all just different pieces of the same world so using 
to mean all of reality in one example thereof nh right right right so many worlds interpretations of quantum 
would describe one possible way for reality as a whole to be and on that way of describing it 
as a whole contains multiple cosmoi if whatever the plural of cosmos is whereas for philosophers who are talking 
possible worlds no connection between possible worlds in the way that a connection between different branches of the multiverse 
so far so good we can say look a kind of convenient way to clarify and regiment our talk 
possibility and necessity talk about what is the case according to a complete and consistent description of reality as 
whole sc which includes just to make it perfectly clear not only the purported laws of that world but 
individual events that happened in it right like if i had not crossed the street denotes a possible world 
now why would you want to talk this way there are a number of different motivations and definitely not 
to do justice to them all some of them come from analyzing language you want a kind of systematic 
of logical connections between statements about what could have been the case and what is the case and what 
have been the case or you simply want to have a way of clarifying what i mean when i 
something like this i could have been taller than i am sc right nh so just pause over that 
we can all hear that an ambiguity there on one way of hearing that obviously false sc it be 
if you were taller yeah nh and another way of hearing it plausible and if you embrace talk of 
worlds you can clarify the difference you can say on one way of hearing it i am asserting that 
possible world according to which ned as ned is in that world is taller than ned as he is 
that world and there is no such possible world in any world in which i exist as tall as 
am sc that makes sense chuckle nh on another way of understanding it saying a world in which ned 
he is in that world has a height greater than ned as he is in the actual world and 
we see this just in microcosm here how talk of possible worlds can help clarify distinctions that ordinary language 
blur sc yeah okay and i want to mention the name david lewis i think probably the greatest ratio 
importance to modern philosophy versus public recognition most people on this feed have never heard of him in the 
that heard of wittgenstein or sartre and he took he did a lot of the spade work in making 
of this notion of possible worlds and he went so far as to say all real in some sense 
modal realism nh right and hard to overstate how dramatic this move is so so far if hearing the 
talking about possible worlds you might think alright that seems like a useful device sc yeah exactly a tool 
lewis wanted to say not just a useful device he well he just want to say he did say 
in order for us to use this talk of possible worlds with a kind of clean intellectual conscience we 
to answer the question a version of the question that we started this podcast with which is are and 
enough just to say stories because lewis would say okay stories in what language exactly are these stories that 
graspable are they written in a language that could be understood by a human a little awkwardly if stories 
just be any stories they have to be consistent on the usual way of understanding it and they have 
be complete in that the story as it were answers any question we might pose of it sc the 
world yeah right nh and that notion of completeness is actually related to consistency through the back door part 
what we mean by saying a story is complete is that any addition to it would render it inconsistent 
full in what it says about the world that it say anything more without collapsing into inconsistency sc some 
to every question you could allow to be asked nh but just focus on this demand of consistency lewis 
want to know what do we mean by consistent there and for him it was very important to give 
answer to that that just reintroduce notions of possibility and necessity so a move making here that for people 
are coming at this from outside philosophy is going to seem strange and cards on the table rightly so 
think but the move is to say not enough to use this notion of possible worlds to clarify our 
of possibility and necessity we need to use it to analyze that talk into some other terms nh so 
do we mean by analyzing talk into other terms well helpful to draw on mathematics here so in number 
we think of the notion of a prime number as a primitive notion where like jazz if you have 
ask what a prime number is you obviously never worked with one or something like that we think we 
define precisely what a prime number is in other terms and in philosophy and indeed in the sciences and 
we very often face this question should we take some term as needing to be when should we think 
going to use this term with a good conscience we really need a story about how to understand it 
other terms i for example think our talk of causality is like that i think as a matter of 
intellectual hygiene we really need to explain our talk of causation cause and effect in some other terms fiendishly 
to do that nh lewis thought we had to do that with our notions of possibility and necessity and 
thought he could do that in a twostep process so first step to say that something is possible is 
say that a possible world in which true second step a possible world is literally a concrete chunk of 
as a whole how is it related to the chunk that in it bears no spacetime relation to our 
at all it is in that sense a completely separate chunk of reality now notice something fast just happened 
said a chunk of reality that is reality as a whole includes the actual world and it includes other 
material chunks that are other possible worlds but i say before that a possible world was a way that 
as a whole could be sc yeah nh well you say both of those are the same sc the 
are failing us a little bit nh yes yeah yeah and so lewis recognized that and he said i 
just to sort of lodge the basic idea into your head that a possible world is a way reality 
a whole could be i really mean reality as a whole i meant our sc yeah okay that makes 
nh so sort of the whole package there sc parenthetically max tegmark has reinvented and reintroduced this idea from 
cosmological point of view saying that every mathematical structure corresponds to a real existing world nh is it corresponds 
or is sc is laughter sc not sure a difference but if channeling max then he would say is 
so this is going to get us appealed but going to say it anyway laughter sc a measure problem 
that case nh yes yes yes sc if all the possible worlds exist one exists where gravity is the 
square law up until nh right sc and why can we therefore say it probably in our world nh 
laughter nh so lewis himself have a lot to say about the problem of induction i think and i 
this just from conversations i had with him not from my knowledge of what written read a lot of 
written but i may have missed something i think he thought it was just unavoidable that we have to 
ourselves something like a rational entitlement to believe that the corner of reality that in the actual world is 
and elegant sc good so max would like to so i think actually improved that a little bit saying 
is some measure of simplicity in the sense of algorithmic simplicity the way the shortest descriptions of the entire 
get more weight somehow than longer ones and i think that just pulled that out of nothing but at 
it would help with the puzzle nh yeah interesting so it would be interesting to know how he would 
the following question shortest descriptions in what language sc well there you go but i do think an answerable 
i think computer scientists think about that some universality some in the studies of kolmogorov complexity some wiggle room 
not infinite wiggle room in answering that question nh right right right so that would be interesting to dig 
a kind of famous variant on the problem of induction here due to nelson goodman that involves using weird 
to describe a pattern this is the grue and bleen problem which you may have heard of which arises 
the kind of example goodman had in mind is very simple much simpler than the kind that max is 
about but if you imagine that you go out into your garden every day and you look at your 
and you notice that the young ones the unripe ones are green and the ripe ones are red you 
describe the pattern observed in two different vocabularies you can use the familiar vocabulary of green and red or 
could use a kind of bent vocabulary where you say something going to for goodman it was blue and 
were the things now going to be red and green say something is like reen if green up until 
thousand twenty or red and after and i say something is gred if red up until two thousand twenty 
green thereafter the clever move here is that green and red are interdefinable with reen and gred nh and 
now we can ask which is the right way to describe this we might say look a world in 
the colors flipped on that date would be a less simple we should believe our world is less simple 
it looks less simple if you describe it using the greenred vocabulary but using the reengred vocabulary look simpler 
world in which you know very young tomatoes are reen and ripe tomatoes are gred always sc this seems 
be a problem that could in principle be overcome because of the fact that these concepts do not exist 
isolation right nh yes yes sc there are photons there is the universe and maybe not as much free 
labels as we might imagine nh right want to look at how things appear when down at the level 
fundamental physical details is there still the same flexibility available sc i think some flexibility there like if hamiltonian 
lagrangian mechanics but not infinite okay okay and just because we have to cover so many centuries of knowledge 
such a little time so lewis sets out this idea of possible worlds he supposes that real do we 
on the table the best argument that we should think of them as real nh i can give you 
i think is the best argument but it really demands a crucial premise which is that an account of 
and necessity that analyze those terms in other terms that have no modal character to them is distinctively inferior 
an account that does analyze them in nonmodal terms and i know how to argue for that premise lewis 
this famous work called on the plurality of worlds employs that premise very cleverly and i indicated some of 
ways i guess i give him proper credit but it was from reading that book that i learned this 
about the best complete stories that to make that account of possible worlds work you really do need a 
notion a notion of consistency down at rock bottom that you analyze away and for lewis that was an 
serious cost now what i again know how to make plausible is why that was a serious cost sc 
nh and it may be that at heart there was this deep humean sympathies he had he was a 
about laws of nature but it may be that that ran much deeper that a notion an unanalyzed notion 
possibility or necessity is just anathema like something just profoundly mysterious about that sc certain personally skeptical about the 
of other possible worlds but i think i could sympathize with the feeling that it would make life easier 
if we have to keep using these in our talk just believing in them it takes a burden off 
our shoulders right nh right and it is true that philosophers often talk the way lewis would recommend that 
talk sc yeah nh we routinely say things like there is a possible world in chuckle nh and not 
about this we say is a consistent story about the world according to we just say this sc right 
philosophers of all people are supposed to be careful but the fact they have trouble with it maybe means 
good so i think this is bringing us back to what it means to be the cause of something 
when we say got sick because i had bad comparing the world we live in to another possible world 
which i have sushi is that right nh right yeah yeah yeah sc but not quite enough nh right 
not just any possible world a possible world in which you have bad sushi you had bad chicken wings 
sc still would have gotten sick right yeah so where all the fun lies like comparing how do we 
the possible worlds nh yes yes and been a lot of thought put into this recently by philosophers and 
alike and a little back story there why are nonphilosophers involved in this debate well there are lot of 
who worry quite a lot about how we can draw conclusions about what causes and what forms statistical data 
from data yeah nh yeah and again this is a scenario where no expert on the history but pretty 
that statistics as a field started out in the early century fairly hostile to the notion of causation you 
find actually checked one important work i think it was pearson a booklength treatment of statistics early in the 
where a whole chapter on why the notion of causality should be banished from good science sc well judea 
who is leading the counterattack there certainly is very vocal about the fact that statistics as a field does 
take causation seriously put it that way nh right right right but the early statisticians did have a point 
the sense that if you compare our ordinary way of talking about cause and effect to the ways of 
that they were recommending in terms of precisely definable notions of correlation it looks like with respect to scientific 
no contest the notions of correlation are so much more rigorous sc and again reminiscent of the humean versus 
argument if you know what all the correlations are what extra do you get by saying that something causes 
nh yes yes yes absolutely absolutely so a deep foundational question i think and if i had to say 
the prevailing view of that question is among people like pearl who are fans of causal talk that you 
the kind of knowledge you need to help you decide how to intervene when deciding how to intervene sc 
by the way is another sort of hypothetical possible world kind of discussion right nh right sc if i 
intervene if i nh right right yeah in fact we probably should have brought that up earlier in a 
the most immediately intuitive way in which we in our encounter with the world are up to our ears 
hypotheticals constantly thinking about would happen if i were to do this or to do or retrospectively we might 
like if only i had done and someone like pearl takes that kind of talk very seriously and rightly 
sc sure yeah whatever our philosophical stances are we do talk that way and we kind of have to 
nh right right right and i suppose in a way i was getting at with that wild thought experiment 
the two theories that evokes the same sort of thought that like a structure to the possibilities preset and 
reasoning about what to do sort of wondering what that structure is no so for fans of what has 
to be called an interventionist approach to causation it has lots of different labels the core thought that is 
causal relations are relations that at least in principle are exploitable for purposes of manipulation like sc okay nh 
another way to put it is our interest in causation is an interest in facts about the world that 
can use to settle what would happen if what would happen if you do one thing or another and 
can easily think of examples where manipulation is about humans as off the table we might wonder what would 
happened to the dinosaurs if no asteroid had struck at a certain point and for people who take this 
approach i think supposed to see that as a kind of natural extrapolation of a kind of way of 
about the world that really has its home in human agency sc and when you say it that way 
just seems so sweetly reasonable that how can so that just right but what are the other possible ways 
thinking about causation nh i think that that is an open question and i find myself in a rhetorically 
situation here because i think severe limitations on the interventionist approach which i can explain but it would be 
better for my purposes if i could say and a nice but actually hard to think of an alternative 
like string theory and quantum gravity like the leading candidate and or the multiverse is even a better example 
explaining cosmological finetuning when i had leonard susskind on the podcast and a fan of the multiverse and how 
explains why various parameters in our observable universe have the numbers that they do and he gets a lot 
pushback for that and he says tell me what else it could be i want it to be this 
i have a theory that predicts it it seems to work going to go with that until you can 
nh yeah yeah which i think is a reasonable attitude especially if a working scientist sc yeah nh i 
you have to be careful though not to throw too many babies out with the bathwater so just to 
where some of the difficulties arise in the social sciences we might want to attribute effects to features of 
world where not just that we manipulate them not even clear what we would have in mind by manipulating 
so maybe your social class has effects downstream effects on the kind of opportunities available to you we think 
do you manipulate social class directly and important to recognize that the background idea here is that causal relations 
the kinds of relations that would be manifested in an ideal controlled experiment sc yeah exactly nh so what 
be a controlled experiment sc and in the possible world language that corresponds to something like a minimal change 
one world to another nh right right in fact the cleanest change would be you have a godlike power 
swoop in on the cosmos at some localized place and time tweak it while holding everything else at that 
fixed and then see how things evolve forward sc and in some sense what pearl tries to formalize in 
causal calculus theory nh yeah yeah yeah though a little quietist i think about what the background is here 
me i come at this against the background of all the stuff been talking about about laws of nature 
i say like well if already got in place however you think about them humean or antihumean things that 
to treat us laws that tell you how to extrapolate forward from any given complete state of the world 
we can kind of get some control over counterfactuals that involve like localized changes to a state sc yeah 
but pearl say much about that he as i would put it this is a place where i would 
the counterfactuals that he describes in his causal diagrams i would want them to be analyzed in terms of 
else sc yeah okay fair nh and that who knows maybe just an aesthetic preference on my part where 
to treat that notion really as a kind of primitive and build a formal system around it sc okay 
you were giving us reasons to be skeptical of interventionist accounts nh right right so if you think of 
features like class is one but one race you might think that what race you have has effects on 
prospects but that is a little awkward if an interventionist to try to answer the question would be a 
controlled experiment in this or there are much more mundane examples too there are everyday examples so right now 
a kind sort of bluegray shirt a question we could ask would this conversation have gone differently or be 
differently right now if your shirt were some wild hawaiian sc right nh maybe it go differently maybe sc 
lost respect for me nh exactly yeah sc but it would have been a much overlapping conversation nh so 
was that sc yeah nh right a way not to clarify that question about the influence the color of 
shirt may or may not be having on the course of this conversation right now at this moment we 
not clarify that question by seeing it as the question how would this conversation go from this point forward 
your shirt as a result of a localized intervention were a hawaiian print like a loud hawaiian print rather 
this nice bluegray right sc yeah okay nh the hypothetical situation imagining here is one where as it were 
swoops in makes a localized change to the pattern on your shirt and then we see how our conversation 
forward from there how the conversation would go my god sean what happened to your laughter sc exactly right 
i see it violates the laws of physics as we understand them nh yeah yeah and once you notice 
this problem ramifies in the social and psychological realms actually a student of mine alex prescottcouch now a philosophy 
at oxford who really pointed this out to me at least quite clearly how widespread this issue is he 
a case where oh joey is a student at a school and joey is a child of a single 
and gets teased a lot at school for being a child of a single parent his classmates are kind 
jerks and joey is stressed out and you you might think a good question how the teasing is interacting 
the fact that just got a single parent in producing his stress nh and for an interventionist the natural 
to approach this question is to ask a bunch of hypotheticals the actual situation where the variable the parent 
is set at one and the teasing variable is set at one and what we should do is contrast 
with hypothetical situations in which those variables have the other possible values and that works okay for some settings 
those alternative variables we could meaningfully ask how stressed out he would be if he teased but still had 
one parent or how stressed out he would be if he had two parents and teased the weird one 
stressed out would he be if he had two parents and were systematically teased at school for having one 
as alex points out he would be in some kafkaesque scenario sc yeah like why are you doing chuckle 
and whatever our answer to that question is it simply does not seem to be illuminating the causal question 
were asking in the first place it seems like the wrong way to think about it sc kind of 
minimal change nh yeah right the minimal change and there are other things too if we think about protracted 
like maybe randolph for example smoked heavily in his and he got cancer in his and curious about whether 
decadelong history of heavy smoking caused his cancer notice not curious about whether that puff on that occasion caused 
cancer we really feel like in order to track the causal relations interested in we need to zoom out 
a longer time scale so what would it be to intervene on that history in a localized way that 
potentially confounding variables the crucial thing sc so very roughly and perhaps unsatisfyingly the situation we seem to be 
is talk of causation or whatever it means to talk of it does involve a comparison of different possible 
what is not completely clear is how to do the comparison which world to include nh i think a 
good way to put it sc interesting to me especially because in science over and over again we reach 
where asking and caring about different questions because of advances in technology like quantum computing for example now that 
can do it but in some sense this is an example where maybe not within philosophy but in the 
of the world asking this philosophical question because of advances in technology now that in the big data era 
we can see some nh yeah right sc the idea of pointing them and being a good inductor or 
seeing some pattern and attaching some emerging reality to it is becoming more important nh yeah and i think 
social scientists who are fans of this interventionist approach would really emphasize this kind of point they would say 
in a position to do causal investigation or causal inquiry better and this interventionist approach provides us the right 
tool we now have the ability to use that tool we can either do randomized control trials or like 
best social scientists are incredibly clever at finding ways in which nature has done that for us and that 
give us insight in a kind of rigorous grounded way that we have before just by going and talking 
people or living with them and so on but there is ongoing uncertainty i think within that field or 
outright dispute about whether losing something if we just set aside as kind of unscientific or unrigorous those more 
have historically been very important sc but it sounds like plenty of room for a useful productive interaction between 
and social scientists here maybe nh yes the hope sc alright always a good lesson to end on so 
hall thanks so much for being on the podcast nh oh welcome been a delight music brilliant and engaging 
thank youthe terms causalitycausation belong to the dinosaur age i know this is a judgemental statement however i think 
term causecausalitycausation may be done away with and replaced with the more understandable words and the difference between the 
and the latter are the former implies a causal agent for an outcomeeffect while the the latter does not 
a causal agent instead it gives validity to the overall system itself as it is without dividing the system 
a causal agent and a causal outcome causality is an anthropocentric concept while pattern is a nonanthropocentric concept as 
is descriptive and does not try to derive an ought anthropocentric from an is thanks for a very stimulating 
however i would have liked to hear something about how contingencies play a role in future realities as someone 
identifies as something of a mathematical monadist i think true that given our observations in the supercollider case and 
the twoparticles case from the beginning we do in fact can be found in both formalism a and b 
so there is no fact of the matter as to what the universe is like from our insideview epistemical 
the problem that arises then is not believe yourself to be a boltzmann or rather why believe in causality 
all if any possible sequence of succeeding events are equally how do you differentiate between world b and b 
unless you do the chacha right now the sun and in that sense not sure i agree with the 
view that our world is just a collection of unconnected events because clearly contradicted by the unreasonable effectiveness of 
a humean perspective as instantiated in a human brain has to justify why it just decided to pull amount 
physical facts in observance out of nowhere when a perfectly usable physical theory right there that explains all of 
and i think happening here when taking the ultimate outside view and talking about all possible sets of physical 
is that brains found inside a set that have an are simply not interesting or possibly more stark are 
brains but random assortments of meat without meaning if we look at ourselves we see a brain that is 
at all randomly selected but that has internal states that track a correlation with external states and external effects 
past states on some fundamental level this is what a brain is to begin with a collection of predictive 
explanatory patterns i think in that sense the the necessity of future events following from past events is not 
by mathematical or logical necessity but anthropic necessity the need for there to be a universe so that thought 
can be useful at all relationally brains are about mathematical structures not random collections of events not sure if 
view really holds up under pressure but increasingly having trouble thinking of reality in any other way it better 
was an excellent conversation i know sean is an admirer of hume but i admit i find it hard 
understand how a theoretical physicist would go about explaining their passion for science if hume is right running experiments 
be like rolling a die over and over to see if you can keep coming up with equations that 
consistent with all of your observed rolls even if you can come up with such an equation it would 
tell you anything about what your next roll is likely to be i have been playing a video game 
the witness it is a puzzle game where you are on an island and you have to solve puzzles 
involve drawing paths on a grid what makes the game interesting and difficult is that you are not given 
rules you need to follow in order to solve the puzzles so you not only have to find the 
path through each grid based on a given rule you also have to discover the rule so for example 
will be various shapes of different colors on the grid you draw one path and it work you try 
and it works you do the same with another similar puzzle and eventually you think you have figured out 
rule you need to follow to solve the puzzle but then the game will throw a puzzle at you 
is impossible to solve using the rule you came up with so you have to rethink the rule you 
been following for example there was a set of puzzles involving sun shapes of various colors i solved a 
of them and decided the pattern was all the correct paths divided the grid up into sections and in 
section there were exactly two suns of a given color no more no less but then i hit a 
where there was only one sun shape on the grid clearly the rule i had come up with had 
be wrong but it be completely wrong the number of possible paths through the puzzles is huge so if 
had been completely wrong there is no way i could have found the correct path on all the previous 
and i often got it on the first try using my rule but my rule could not have been 
right either why is this game fun and interesting because the player knows that someone programmed the game and 
there is a correct rule for each of the puzzles and the goal is to discover it the programmer 
have programmed the game so that a random number generator kicked off every time the player tried a path 
the puzzle they had never tried before and if the number generated was a prime number or among some 
chosen set of numbers the game would treat that path as correct that would not be a very fun 
to play because the best strategy would simply be to try random solutions until the random number generator produced 
prime number and then move to the next puzzle solving one puzzle would not help you solve the next 
though the game is technically still following a rule it is not a rule that is very helpful when 
comes to predicting the future based on the past if hume is right it seems to me scientists are 
playing a game that is analogous to the game where the correct solution is determined by a random number 
they run an experiment something happens they come up with a rule that is consistent with whatever happened in 
experiment and all other observations that have been made but this does not help you predict what the outcome 
the next experiment will be and you have not discovered anything about the world you have simply invented a 
that is consistent with what you have observed so far so why bother running experiments or coming up with 
if the rules you come up with do not tell you anything about the world and do not help 
predict the future it is not clear to me why science would inspire the passion and pathos that it 
among its practitioners if this is what scientists believed they were really doing why run an experiment rather than 
a nap in both cases something happens perhaps when i take a nap i might wake up on the 
side of the world then i can invent a rule that is consistent with the fact that i usually 
up on the other side of the world when i take a nap but i did this time this 
is unlikely to tell me anything about whether i am likely to wake up on the other side of 
world the next time i take a nap though since it is purely posthoc i suspect that most scientists 
if they profess to be humeans are antihumeans on some unconscious level i think most scientists believe they are 
playing a game where they compete with each other to come up with the best posthoc rule that would 
all previous observations if the world were actually following it even though they believe the world is actually following 
rule or any rule it was fascinating conversation you talked wide variety of subjects ranging from causation induction david 
to modal logics of david lewis you even briefly considered the new riddle of induction by nelson goodman problem 
necessary connexion in causal relation and problem of induction are closely connected in philosophy of david hume yet these 
definitely distinct problems hume rightly thought that we cannot but rely on habit and observed constant conjunction when we 
our conceptions of these matter no necessity because cause has always preceded the effect we infer that it always 
there is no ultimate guarantee that the future will necessarily be the same of course we have to make 
assumptions but habit rather than a reason which guides us pingback miniheap daily nous comments are closed sean carroll
