episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll sc if you 
following the presidential primary campaign here in the united states here in one of the most unusual candidates was 
yang who had a set of very specific interesting messages that we usually hear in presidential campaigns he was 
concerned in particular about the oncoming wave of automation going to change the nature of the workforce and so 
idea was that robots or automated technologies more generally would gradually replace jobs and therefore we had to provide 
universal basic income to let people live and flourish in a world that had much less work in it 
aside from what economic policy you think is the best idea this question of whether or not automation really 
replace jobs is a very important one so what going to discuss today our guest is john danaher a 
lecturer in the law school at the national university of ireland and his interests are in the intersection of 
neuroscience technology especially artificial intelligence and so forth sc john has his own podcast called philosophical disquisitions that you 
find a link to in the blog post and written a book called automation and utopia human flourishing in 
world without work so to put it very simplistically get into more details in the podcast of course but 
john says automation is coming yes going to put us all out of work and yes that is awesome 
once we need to work we can do all these other wonderful and so the question is well what 
these wonderful things will we really do them will we feel fulfilled without a job to go to nine 
is there some moral hazard associated with not being a working person with having all the leisure time you 
so john tries to make the argument that actually kind of the good thing that you might expect naively 
allowed to work you could do things but have a much better society and much better individual lives when 
can choose what work to do what work not to do sc extremely thoughtprovoking and very futuristic in a 
way this is something that might actually be approaching us so important i think to think these issues through 
be prepared for what might be a very very dramatic change in how we organize human society i should 
that we had an audio issue for the first twenty minutes of this podcast not really bad just that 
wrong microphone was getting used and then we switch after twenty minutes is over so if you persevere through 
first twenty minutes the audio quality will get a lot better just despite both being podcasters the technology sometimes 
us and with that go music sc john danaher welcome to the mindscape podcast john danaher thank you sean 
pleasure to be here actually a big fan of this podcast so a bit of a thrill to be 
it sc well before i forget we should advocate your podcast right do you have one jd i do 
so i run a blog called philosophical disquisitions a cumbersome title but i picked it years ago and sticking 
it and i have a podcast of the same name associated with that mainly about the philosophy of technology 
the ethics of technology but i do some occasional audio essays about other topics sc cool we will definitely 
to it in the blog post i put up for this episode but speaking of technology and philosophy and 
forth but not a professional philosopher or is that your training in a law school right jd yeah so 
a philosopher by training more by application i suppose my typical joke is that to lawyers a philosopher and 
philosophers a lawyer sc oh i know that one well yes chuckle okay so going to get into this 
that you advocate about giving ourselves over to the robots taking over and why that might be a good 
but i wanted to start as you start in the book because you have some great numbers some great 
to really drive home how fast things are changing just to quote one you say that sorry years ago 
percentage of the vertebrate biomass on earth that was either human beings or our controlled animals our livestock and 
pets was of the vertebrate biomass on earth and by now closer to so we have won the human 
have taken over is that safe to say jd yeah so a statistic that encountered actually something that daniel 
uses a lot in talks so where i got it from and since i published the book people have 
out to me that i know if a fully reliable statistic whether it really is an estimate based on 
number of assumptions that could be questionable but i think the general gist of it which is that humans 
human livestock and animals and human agriculture now really dominate the planet in an unprecedented way in comparison to 
was the case before the agricultural revolution sc yeah willing to believe that not but arguing about whether not 
like it is most of going on here on earth right now i would think and then you go 
the various revolutions had with agriculture and technology and so forth and it really drives home not just human 
of the planet but how rapidly it is all happening right jd right and people are probably familiar with 
of these graphs that you show of the number of calories consumed or burned per person per country since 
industrial revolution and you see this hockey sticklike graph where if you zoom out it looks like nothing happened 
and suddenly everything is happening chuckle sc and even years is an incredibly short time historically speaking the lesson 
take from this that is relevant to where going to go in the conversation is we are nowhere near 
right our situation is incredibly rapidly changing and therefore we have every justification for imagining that a thousand years 
now things are going to be dramatically different in some way whether or not we can predict what that 
is going to be jd right yeah so the assumption that the future is going to look much like 
past at least at a certain time horizon looks like a dubious assumption i know if this is a 
idea to bring it up but i was just listening to your interview with martin reese which was released 
week which probably means nothing by the time this comes out i know when this will actually come out 
he made a similar point about people building cathedrals in the middle ages why do they do that when 
live to see them because they presume that their children would live in a very similar world and appreciate 
same things and how nowadays that assumption looks a lot of us are questioning that more because it feels 
the future might be radically different from the past sc yeah absolutely and by the way it is always 
to mention previous podcast episodes that done and you can do the same thing for your own podcast episodes 
fine so the part of this rapid change that you care about is broadly construed automation or i guess 
specifically the effect having on jobs and work we used to be huntergatherers and basically everyone had a job 
hunting or gathering or doing the support work for hunters and gatherers and things have changed a lot why 
just give us your potted quick explanation of how work has changed over the years jd yeah the basic 
is that the tasks that humans used to perform are increasingly being performed by machines or through a lot 
technological assistance so even if you have tasks that are fully automated you have tasks that are automated to 
a percentage that the humanperformed element of the task is quite limited and you can see this in many 
sectors of society so one of the things i try to do in the opening chapter of this book 
to sketch different domains of society and how seeing this trend towards what i call human obsolescence probably a 
way of putting it or a strong way of putting it but i think the trend is very clear 
agriculture if you want to start with that example you have fairly precipitous declines in the number of human 
employed in agriculture since the or most european economies and the us the majority of workers worked in agriculture 
the up until the early and now talking about less than of humans employed in agriculture jd these are 
actually that i based from max roser our world in data who has a lot of nice charts and 
about this a similar story is true in manufacturing although i think there much more apparent to people because 
is one of the industries that is most clearly automated because the science of automation are so visible there 
the stereotypical image of the production line like a motor car factory or something is a clear illustration of 
trend towards automation we also see it in other areas so i look at the impact on the professions 
rise of automated assistance in medicine in law as well and also in science i talk about some examples 
and more familiar with this than i would be but there are clearly increasingly science is a big data 
lots of computerized systems with performing statistical analysis and calculations but also some initial evidence that creating robots that 
perform their own experiments as a team and the university of aberystwyth in wales that have created these robots 
and eve that run their own experiments they come up with their own hypotheses and tests their sorry experimentally 
these hypotheses reach conclusions so a time when seeing this kind of rapid trend towards automation in many different 
and oftentimes when people discuss this topic they focus on just one sector of society rather than all of 
and one of the things i wanted to do is try and give a wide sketch of all these 
domains of activity sc yeah actually i really liked an example that you had which is completely obvious and 
feel bad for not just figuring it out myself but the financial trading literally on the floor of the 
york stock exchange the idea that that has more or less gone away and now we just use the 
exchange as a backdrop for video cameras tv shows and things like that but all of it has become 
in the real world i knew that intellectually but the vivid picture of the trading floor more or less 
really hit home jd yeah so this notion that the trading floor is a place where you got lots 
people crowding together barking buy and sell orders at each other kind of the image you see in a 
from the trading places with eddie murphy and dan aykroyd sc oh yeah classic jd the stereotypical view of 
market nowadays yes most trading activity takes place digitally in fact most trading activity is performed by algorithms the 
are a little bit tricky here but most people will assume on pretty good grounds more than of all 
are executed by algorithms automatically sc yeah like i said i knew this intellectually but after reading your book 
was moved to go look at the data here i think that true that the literal size of the 
york stock exchange floor peaked in the it expanded but then been shrinking ever since literally been cutting off 
floor space because they need it less and less so it says something about how our society is changing 
yeah a regulatory reason for that as well which is just to do with the nationalization of markets in 
us so the physical location of new york is less important than it ever was partly due to technology 
also partly due to changes in regulation sc oh well always these details that make the story chuckle a 
bit less romantic but okay but okay that gives us a bit of a background and i think that 
most listeners get it that a lot of more automation but dig into what it does mean across the 
sectors i have this feeling that throughout the last several hundred years this and that particular industry has become 
but always been the case that jobs for human beings have popped up somewhere else right sc like lost 
lot of farming jobs and a lot of industrial jobs but jobs in doing other things that have popped 
and trying to make the much stronger case that entering a zone where some jobs will be automated and 
be replacements for them and the total number of jobs to be done by humans is going to precipitously 
jd yeah i think that you have to be a little bit careful when we talk about this topic 
going to do maybe something boring and philosophical which is to define some of the terms that get bandied 
in conversations sc please no we appreciate that come to the right podcast jd so i frame my discussion 
the book about the automation of work and i do that partly because the way in which a lot 
people talk about it but it is a little bit misleading in the sense that work is a very 
term and people mean different things by it so what i mean by it is the performance of skills 
return for some kind of economic reward so at least for me work any particular activity or task it 
rather a condition under which humans perform tasks so a little bit of an abstract notion and a job 
is effectively a socially or economically defined role that is made up of a bunch of tasks things that 
do in which you then receive some kind of economic reward in return for doing those tasks so if 
taxi driver you drive people around from here to there according to their wishes you might small talk with 
or something so these are all tasks that make up that job jd and when we talk about the 
of work and the automation of jobs misleading to assume that technology necessarily displaces work and necessarily displaces jobs 
technology really does is it tends to change the tasks that make up jobs and make up work so 
kind of links into your point which is that because jobs are really defined as collections of tasks we 
automate of those tasks but oftentimes other tasks that humans can move into and that often humans have an 
advantage in performing relative to machines so automation necessarily lead to the displacement of jobs we can sometimes redefine 
roles so that we can focus on different tasks sc yes jd and so this is what we see 
is that technology has very clearly had a disruptive impact on lots of jobs but it necessarily led to 
unemployment because people have moved into other kinds of jobs that are defined by different sets of tasks and 
economists refer to this as the complementarity effect of technology so a lot of times we focus on the 
effect of technology that technology substitutes for human labor but oftentimes there are complementary tasks humans can perform alongside 
that kinda opens up a whole vista or new space of work for the future and this is why 
seen this trend towards kind of structural unemployment over the long term as a result of technology sc yeah 
think the point of jobs as a category are socially constructed is a very good one not literally something 
needs to be done a way choosing to organize our society to give people reward monetary rewards for doing 
tasks like you say so if true how can we ever say that confident that jobs are going to 
away or that the need for human beings to do jobs will become less and less can we always 
new constructions of what we mean by a job jd yeah look so possible that you read my book 
arguing for the extreme thesis that all work is going away but what i would say is that i 
something that necessarily happens i think something that depends to a large extent on how society responds to automation 
not a technological determinist or a fatalist about these things i think there are choices that we make individually 
and institutionally that will make a difference to this as to whether we always find new jobs but i 
skeptical about the potential for us to always find new complementary tasks that humans can perform alongside robots or 
which will be solutions for kind of mass employment jd and there are a few different reasons for my 
and i discuss four of them in the book one is just that there is some preliminary data suggesting 
when employers turn to robots or automation it tend to increase the overall level of work or it have 
neutral effect on work it tends to actually reduce the number of workers demanded so some interesting empirical work 
by daron acemoglu and pascual restrepo i think both in mit and they did work on the us labor 
where they suggested that for every robot a company uses in the us it tends to displace either between 
and six workers so it was a kind of a net loss of employment it was data based on 
one thousand nine hundred ninety to and then more recently they did a study of french companies who automated 
they saw a similar effect jd number one that this companies tended to increase their productivity fairly dramatically and 
had a larger share of the overall productivity in the french market and also they tended to reduce the 
of workers that they employed so there is that initial empirical data just two studies mentioning here which suggests 
the use of robots in particular lead to gains or a neutral level of employment it seems to lead 
net losses overall sc but i think sort of just pushing a little bit because probably going to agree 
your thesis overall but that data seems to indicate that within those particular industries robots came in and human 
went out but then other industries come up we have kinds of jobs we have before so but you 
to argue that at a point now where i think you want to argue tell me that good that 
are going away that we should imagine moving toward a future where we or not sad that there are 
jobs for human beings jd and just to say one thing on the empirical evidence so acemoglu and restrepo 
look at the scenarios to whether there are jobs being created in other sectors of the economy at least 
they did the study in the us and they find a net gain so when they looked within particular 
they saw a higher level of net loss but even when they looked across industries they saw still a 
loss overall for every robot employed today and one of their points which i think is a good one 
said this is at a point in time when actually been relatively little use of robots from one thousand 
hundred ninetytwo to there was relatively little uptake of robotization in us industries and since then actually increasing and 
probably expect it to increase in the future so this was one point sc yeah maybe we should also 
about just to make things a little bit more concrete what are the kinds of jobs where easy to 
robots taking over or automation taking over and the ones where hard you mentioned fruit picking as one where 
but nevertheless becoming true perhaps and then also more intrinsically human jobs like government or being a scientist or 
an artist and trying to make the case that even in those we can imagine robots doing what human 
currently do jd yeah a roboticist called hans moravec who formulated this thing called paradox back in the where 
talked about how actually highlevel cognitive jobs are oftentimes the easiest things to automate because they tend to be 
easy to formulate an algorithm to perform those tasks whereas physical manual labor is often the most difficult thing 
automate because it relies on unpredictable or less easily controlled stochastic variables and i know if his framing of 
is correct i think what most people would say nowadays is that routine work is easily automatable and anything 
is a little bit more difficult to automate although the new kids of ai that we are developing seem 
be getting better at performing even these nonroutine tasks the things that we thought traditionally were hard to automate 
so yeah just one point on what kinds of jobs we can expect to see automated it seems to 
that probably more and more jobs we can expect to see automated based on current technological trends and true 
if there are limits to the current systems of ai that we currently deploy because i think a lot 
room for different uses of the technology that we currently have that been tried out yet i think kind 
lost the thread of your original question now sc chuckle well just trying to raise this idea that sure 
in many minds that sure i can imagine financial trading or building cars being replaced by robots but i 
being a pop star or being a law professor being replaced by robots right jd right certainly intuitively plausible 
me that artistic jobs or entertainment industry jobs are probably not going to be subject to widescale automation there 
people who are building holographic pop stars in asian countries seen several examples of this and there are people 
are building or creating algorithms that can make the next beatles album a famous example from a few years 
but i doubt sceptical as to whether people will be that interested in robot or computercreated art i think 
as a novelty initially but i think there is something in art that we like the human origin and 
human story behind it and that often counts for more than just the end product and we see this 
in debates about art and forgery a perfect forgery is never as good as the original artwork why is 
i think part of the reason is that we care about the origin of artworks more than we care 
say the origin of furniture or laptops broadly speaking jd some people do care about the origin of those 
but that tends to be a luxury good but the idea of automating pop stars that provide much reassurance 
people the notion that that is a type of work going to be relatively resilient to automation be that 
because never been a job for the masses of people these are always jobs reserved for the elite few 
are socalled superstar markets where the handful of individuals tend to extract most of the value from those markets 
yeah i think we should be reassured about that notion there are other kinds of jobs that we might 
to hold up or be more resilient to automation like care work or any form of work where the 
touch seems to be important but not entirely convinced that they will be that resilient to automation either because 
these are jobs that few humans really want to perform one of the debates where this comes up most 
in care of the elderly for example a lot of people argue that we use robots to automate the 
of the elderly and i think they have good ethical reasons for thinking that we want to do that 
but i think there is a significant pressure to do it because a lot of people like performing that 
of dirty care work so to speak and also a demographic challenge here as well which is got increasing 
populations and we need to do something to care for them one of the countries where you see the 
automation of care work is in japan which is one of the oldest populations in the world partly due 
reasons of restricting immigration into japan but also partly because of that demographic challenge that younger generations in japan 
want to perform this kind of work or able to perform this kind of work sc right yeah i 
kate darling for example who i did have on a previous podcast developing robots to help care for elderly 
so that does sound like the kind of thing where you when you first say the words people are 
no that could never be done in but maybe it could once you just think about it a little 
more probably a lot of examples of that jd yeah and just to be clear not necessarily saying that 
are going to do a better job in those industries there are some industries where robots clearly would do 
better job than humans because these are industries that pride themselves on speed and precision so i think financial 
is another good example of that but just that even if robots are less good than humans at performing 
there be a huge supply of human labor into those industries for other demographic or social reasons sc okay 
mostly here not to say that automation is taking over but you want to argue i think the more 
part of your argument is your book is called automation and utopia and i think that doing a good 
by sort of at the labeling is a little bit extremist much more measured in the actual text but 
just imagine a world where work becomes completely so what do you have against work chuckle what are your 
that it would be better if we have to have jobs to earn a living jd yeah and so 
think this is oftentimes the key question what i call in the book the desirability question which is we 
for humans to keep working and remain competitive with machines or to find other jobs for them that complement 
one of this is the more radical view in the book is that we probably want that and there 
several reasons for it and i explore them in a chapter i think i have five different arguments for 
that work is a bad thing and in fact that something being made worse by technology in a lot 
instances so the argument is probably complex insofar as it breaks down into five parts but very briefly the 
why i think work is a bad thing and we should encourage its automation is that work tends to 
freedom of choice it tends to exert this kind of dominating influence over our lives jd i think technology 
making work worse for a lot of people leading to the fissuring of the workplace a lot more outsourcing 
lot more shortterm contract work precarious work gig work seems to be an increasing phenomenon of technologically brokered marketplaces 
uber and deliveroo or other companies like this and also a significant amount of inequality in work nowadays both 
terms of income disparity which appears to have been growing since the and an interesting story you can tell 
that that increase in income disparity seems to have been correlated with a period of time where you see 
automation in middle income middle skill jobs in particularly in the us jd and so inequality in terms of 
but also i think another interesting form of inequality in work which is inequality in terms of the quality 
meaningfulness of the work which is a phenomenon that is discussed by a guy called david autor an mitbased 
does a lot of work on manufacturing and outsourcing but he talks about this polarization effect on the labor 
as a result of technology that people are pushed into either low skill low income work or high skill 
income work and just for people listening to this economists define low skill in a maybe a counterintuitive way 
that just the amount of years of education you need to enter a job it defines whether high or 
skill so lots of low skill work that is highly skilled sc not really a measure of skill but 
sort of background prerequisites you need to take up the job jd yeah exactly so people are pushed into 
lower skilled forms of works which are often more arduous and more difficult tends to be complex physical manual 
which is not always pleasant and has lots of maybe health and longterm health repercussions for people involved in 
but most people go into that low skill bracket because there are relatively fewer high skill high income jobs 
also higher barriers to entry into those jobs so you see this polarization effect in terms of the quality 
work the meaningfulness of the work that people perform jd another reason for not favoring employment is that i 
work is increasingly colonizing our lives to use a strong term in that because the labor market is increasingly 
and work is more precarious as a result of technology people spend a lot more time and attention on 
themselves trying to make themselves employable worrying about employment so even if not spending more time at work and 
evidence to suggest that the amount of hours that people spend per year working has gone down spending a 
more time thinking about work and caring about work jd i have one anecdote in the book which i 
is illustrative of this it actually comes from another author david frayne who wrote an interesting ethnography of workers 
the uk a few years back and he describes this story where he was interviewing a boy in a 
school he was doing some classes with the local school some extracurricular classes and he asked this boy why 
did the class and did he enjoy it and the boy said it was but the main reason why 
did it is that it would ultimately look good on his cv which is a very odd thing for 
think a to be caring about which is building up their cv and their employability laughter jd now anecdata 
i think illustrative of a general trend and the other final reason i have for thinking that the automation 
work is a good thing is that when you look at some of the evidence on whether people enjoy 
that some evidence to suggest that they tend to be quite dissatisfied with work so gallup they do these 
surveys of the global workforce every few years and one of the consistent findings from their surveys over the 
fifteen years or so is that most people express dissatisfaction with the work that doing they feel fully engaged 
it and i think partly driven by the highly competitive and precarious nature of the workplace that people think 
could be doing better or worried about the security of their jobs sc well maybe yeah maybe worth expanding 
little bit on the point that you raised but i think is worth diving into about the gig economy 
about the structure of work these days where jobs seem to be a bit more ephemeral not sure how 
data there is saying if true but certainly the feeling we get and i could imagine that something structural 
the modern age which makes employment less secure and less longterm is that an accurate assessment jd yeah an 
book about this actually by a guy called andrew weil called the fissured workplace where he explores why this 
historically so really in the middle part of the century there was a trend towards very large corporate organizations 
you you had a company like say ford motor cars who employed lots of people and lots of very 
workers under the same corporate umbrella so they would hire catering staff hire accountant workers hire it hire security 
and groundskeepers and so on all employed within the same organization jd and since the been a shift away 
that notion of the big corporation that hires everybody to do all the tasks that are relevant to the 
products producing or whatever service providing and instead what you find is that companies are focusing on what they 
as their core competency and then outsourcing a lot of the other forms of work to parttime contractors or 
companies that specialize in say the provision of accounting services or security staff and so on jd and why 
that happened well there are a couple of reasons why happened one is that it actually tends to be 
more attractive way of arranging a corporation from the perspective of shareholders and consumers because it tends to increase 
returns to shareholders you reduce the cost that you paid oftentimes when you do this kind of fissuring and 
and it tends to also reduce the cost to consumers there tends to be more productivity but workers tend 
get the worst deal in this arrangement sc yeah jd and also technology has facilitated this in so far 
one reason traditionally why you outsource workers is that you be able to easily monitor them and ensure that 
were complying with corporate standards but the advances in surveillance technology have enabled greater consistency and enforcement of corporate 
and one area where this is really transparent is in truck drivers and the amount of ongoing surveillance of 
drivers which has been true for quite some time now but this trend towards increased surveillance is creeping into 
industries as well sc and it certainly sounds reminiscent too in the academic context of a shift towards adjunct 
shortterm contracts rather than tenured professors who are going to be there for many decades jd yeah so another 
of this phenomenon of this drive towards precarious forms of labor i really investigated in detail the reasons for 
in academia i think part of it probably has to do something like the research funding culture that people 
bought out on research grants and tend to employ parttime labor to cover their teaching allocation a trend at 
in the uk and ireland and probably more attractive as well from a managerial perspective that it allows you 
efficiently deliver mass higher education on a tight budget or cut budget sc yeah okay so this argument seems 
amount to not an intrinsic indictment of work but a change in how work is organized in our society 
sort of makes it less rewarding and stable and psychologically helpful and maybe this is a sign of this 
this transition that in the middle of from a everybody work society into a people necessarily work society jd 
so it could be what observing now is friction or teething problems as we transition from one society to 
other and to underlie a point that you just made and i think an important one is that my 
of work that the work is intrinsically bad because if you go back to the definition that i offered 
of work work any particular activity it is rather a condition under which we perform an activity sc yeah 
and my argument is that the conditions under which we perform work perform our jobs tend to be getting 
for the majority of workers not to say that there people who benefit from the current system there clearly 
but the majority seem to be losing out on the current arrangement sc well be remiss if we at 
bring up the arguments that sure some people are thinking that there is an intrinsic value to work that 
work ethic is a good thing to have that people get a sense of identity or even meaningfulness from 
jobs that they do and so someone say the thing to do is not to give in to the 
of work but to reorganize the economy so that jobs are more secure and rewarding jd yeah so there 
a widespread discussion of this in the philosophical literature about work which is meaningful work is what we should 
about and work is oftentimes the important part of identity and sense of meaning and purpose in life and 
sensitive to that concern something i care about but if you take the one example of this that i 
in the book a couple of philosophers who wrote an article called the goods of work other than money 
they identify four things that people get out of work apart from an income they get a sense of 
over some skill set they get to form alliances and friendships with people in the workplace so they have 
sense of community they also get to contribute to their societies in some way sometimes positive maybe sometimes not 
positive but oftentimes the main way in which we people contribute to society is through their work and also 
get a sense of social recognition and status which of course people care about a lot they want to 
respected and recognized by their peers and so if people work lose these four things so what are you 
to about it jd and my response to that is you could lose those four things definitely true but 
question i would have is is whether work is the only way in which we can get a sense 
mastery contribute to our societies have a sense of community and gain recognition and not convinced that it is 
only way that we can get those things i think there might be other fora that we can look 
for pursuing those nonincome related goods of work sc a pretty dramatic shift right i what do we count 
years ago when people were huntergatherers do we count that as work it is doing a kind of job 
what i want to say is that literally throughout all history people have worked and suggesting not the only 
to suggest but that coming to an end and going to be some nostalgia for that period of human 
right jd oh absolutely the thing about huntergatherers there was a very interesting paper written back in the i 
by marshall sahlins called the original leisure society yuval noah harari made a lot of this in one of 
books i think the first one sapiens so this notion that actually huntergatherers were the original leisure society they 
very little time every day working in terms of getting their food they spent a couple of hours doing 
and then the rest of their day was quite leisurely and they seemed to derive a lot of kind 
meaning and satisfaction from that jd one thing i would say is that the level of attachment and nostalgia 
have for work is probably a function of the kind of work that you currently do so people like 
and i who are in these high skill jobs where rewarded for complex creative problemsolving sc we like to 
but we have it pretty good chuckle jd yeah things we can complain about but we have it pretty 
and we also have a lot of autonomy over what we do which a lot of workers have we 
probably the people who are most attached to the current system and most worried about losing out of that 
our work is such a core part of our identity and this is actually one of the things i 
in the book is that for me the notion that i would lose my job that would be significant 
think i would definitely feel that as a loss because my work is so intrinsic to my sense of 
i am but i think i have to be sensitive to the fact that i am in a relatively 
position and not everyone feels the same way and lots and lots of people nowadays get most of their 
and sense of purpose and meaning from nonworkrelated activities from their families from community work from their hobbies and 
interests sc well good and that leads us into i think the big payoff here you imagine a couple 
different scenarios for how we could cope with this transition into a world where work was not taken for 
as something everyone has to do and then you argue that this could be a good thing so i 
the words into your mouth tell us how we could make a transition and why it might be good 
yeah a way that i set this up in the book and also a part of this discussion which 
out so far which is that i have a long discussion of all the negative things that technology does 
our lives as well and the ways in which it can compromise our freedom and our autonomy and our 
and all that even in a nonwork domain but setting that to the sc well actually i think fair 
maybe my fault for not bringing that up give a couple of minutes to say that because i think 
is a point worth making what is your argument about the downsides of technology there are techno utopians techno 
and then probably good arguments on both sides but worth having them in the back of our brains as 
contemplate this transition jd right so this notion that we are going to abandon work and what are we 
to do as a result well there are satirical dystopian versions of what that might entail that look very 
and one of them that i discuss in the book is from the pixar movie walle which is one 
of what a future in which automated technology has become widespread is like and it look to be a 
pleasant one jd so for people who familiar with the movie it depicts a future in which the earth 
been completely despoiled by technology and pollution is rampant and the world is covered in trash and humans have 
onto these offplanet ships trying to find a new home humans have become incredibly obese they ride around in 
motorized chairs all day they get fed a constant stream of light entertainment and fast food jd and all 
them on these interstellar ships that traveling on are these robots that really do all the work and that 
like a very pleasant future because it seems to reduce humans to this kind of passive state where we 
some of the benefits that technology brings to our lives the conveniences of technology but we really do anything 
not the agents that are controlling our future in any meaningful sense jd and because at least in the 
era and liberal western societies we tend to really pride and value our sense of agency and autonomy this 
like a serious threat that automated technologies could pose to us that they could cut us out of the 
and reduce us to essentially servants of the machine so to speak sc yeah i think chuckle i think 
is something to worry about but we have some choice in how going to shape it so how do 
avoid that jd yeah this is how i set it up in the book is that if you imagine 
as a negative future that we want to avoid well two things we can do or two ways of 
to it and a way of thinking about the challenge that technology poses to us which is that increasingly 
seems to be pushing humans out of the cognitive niche a concept from evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology that 
borrow as a metaphor for discussing this in the book jd so humans have evolved that become successful because 
our cognitive powers and our capacity for complex problemsolving but increasingly we are ceding that territory to machines so 
do we do in response well really two things we can do we can race sorry yeah fight back 
the machines in a sense by trying to become more like them more like the machines that are replacing 
sc try to compete with them basically right jd i call this the cyborg solution to our problem or 
pursuit of the cyborg utopia the way i put it in the book or we can cede the territory 
machines and retreat to something else and i call this pursuing the virtual utopia or virtual life and i 
to investigate the benefits and costs of both of those solutions to the problem and i think merit to 
of them but ultimately i try to make the case for thinking that pursuing the virtual life is more 
than it might initially sound to be sc okay but dig into the one you like as much first 
cyborgization how literal are we taking this are you imagining literally that going to look like the borg where 
have metal pieces hanging on to me or is it a slightly more metaphorical version of a cyborg you 
in mind jd so i think you can take both perspectives on it right and i suppose really a 
scale of cyborglike futures for us there is the future in which we really just become very closely integrated 
machines maybe we replace the majority of our biological components with machinelike equivalents something like the borg from star 
or the other view way of looking at it which is actually a view that is favored in some 
circles which is that humans have always been a technological species always had these very close almost symbiotic relationships 
the technology that we create so always been cyborgs in a sense and becoming more cyborglike because becoming more 
on technology but that technology is still external to us not integrated into our biology jd so i think 
kinda two ways of understanding it either you directly integrate the technology into our biological systems possibly even replacing 
or you just have these very close dependency or interdependency relationships with technological artifacts that remain external to your 
sc so in particular i know that certain companies are pursuing some kind of braincomputer interfaces or even neural 
that will sort of hook us into the internet or to computers directly is that a step along the 
towards cyborgization jd yeah i so elon musk is probably the example thinking of the neuralink company is one 
the ones attracted a lot of media attention anyway well i mean braincomputer interfaces are widespread and have been 
quite some time and used for therapeutic reasons brain implants are used for therapeutic reasons there also a large 
of cyborg hackers who people who in their own basements or kitchen laboratories try to implant rfid chips into 
arms or other maybe slightly more complex forms of braincomputer interface so yeah those are some of the possibilities 
of the people i cite in the book as an illustration of an actual living cyborg is an artist 
neil harbisson who i think is based in spain but from northern ireland originally and he wears this device 
into the back of his skull that allows him to hear colors essentially born colorblind and he has this 
that converts light waves into sound waves jd so just kind of or technologically created synesthesia if you like 
using technology to augment or explore different sensory forms of engagement with the world so a more experimental use 
defines himself as a cyborg and some interesting interviews with him where he says that he think that he 
technology in his life he thinks that he is a bit of technology i think founded something called the 
society for people who have a nonhuman identity basically so there are people out there who are very actively 
this kind of highly technologized form of cyborg existence sc and how exactly does this save us from work 
from leaving work missing a little connection there jd yeah it necessarily save us from leaving work what it 
is that is if we are losing competence and power to machines if the kind of walle dystopia is 
realistic one the concern is that we be good at doing anything anymore and need machines to do everything 
us becoming cyborglike is possibly a way of augmenting or enhancing our capacity so that we lose out to 
but perhaps hinted at one of the big risks of doing this which i discuss in the book is 
that would probably seem to be a way of perpetuating the economy in its current form in the sense 
if humans are augmented they become efficient at performing tasks and people want to employ them again jd and 
fact i would have some fears about this that this might double down on many of the worst aspects 
the labor market as we currently see them the aspects that i mentioned earlier on in this discussion so 
example i complained about the highly competitive nature of the labor market nowadays one of the ways in which 
competition manifests itself today is in education competition for upskilling in the future if we pursue this kind of 
path it might manifest itself in the way of competition for cyborg implants and that might also lead to 
inequality and disparity in the workplace if these cyborg implants are things that are only affordable by the elite 
sc even in harry potter he had a much better broom than everybody else and that did help him 
the quidditch matches so technological competition is something that is very hard to escape jd exactly yeah yeah and 
think there are other risks associated with trying to pursue the cyborg path one person put this i think 
well and this is a complex problem so going to treat it rather glibly here but a irish journalist 
mark who wrote this interesting book where he followed a lot of transhumanists or people who are interested in 
identities and that and he pointed out there was an odd paradox or tension in their views which is 
a lot of them are very concerned about how inefficient human biology is and how poorly designed our biological 
is and they have this sense that we are constrained and lack freedom as a result of the constraints 
biology jd and they want to replace that with technology and want us to become more technological like people 
ray kurzweil that want to create digital copies or uploads of the human mind and he argues that this 
odd insofar as replacing the biological prison potentially with a technological prison so substituting one kind of unfreedom for 
kind of unfreedom because who controls the technological infrastructure that you replace yourself with at the moment it seems 
that going to be individuals probably more likely going to be corporations or people who have this specialist knowhow 
create these kinds of technologies so you might end up enslaving yourself to technology and becoming less free as 
result of cyborg organization so i think another serious concern with this solution to our predicament or our problem 
yeah i think it makes sense not sure if true or not because i trust my ability to predict 
future but i think a sensible argument making that sure we can try to outcompete the robots by joining 
but then still stuck in this cycle of being beholden to larger power and economic structures that always have 
good fortunes in mind and especially if now figured out how to make human beings more replaceable less permanently 
etcetera that would only get worse if we were cyborgs i would imagine jd yeah i think you make 
important point which is something that is worth emphasizing which is that i engage in a prediction game here 
be confident of predicting the future in any sense i think is that like a woody allen quote about 
the future is hard prediction is hard particularly when about the future something like that sc i believe niels 
believe it or not jd okay sorry i was wrong sc i only say that because i thought it 
yogi berra and i was wrong laughter jd i think yeah i think getting confused that a similar woody 
quote but anyway the less we mention him the better sc fine jd so really trying to sketch different 
in the book and trying to evaluate them using philosophical methods and i hope that the logic and structure 
the arguments that i lay out is clear so that people can easily critique it if they think wrong 
if that some of the assumptions underlying it are wrong part of what i wanted to do in the 
was to illustrate a way of thinking about the future that cheerleading for a particular future or saying that 
going to doom and gloom and it is trying to be fair to different possibilities even though i take 
on some issues yeah my confidence level in some of the claims i make be particularly high sc well 
predicting is hard but i think you my impression is you were arguing and sort of sympathetic to it 
the more dramatic transition to the future is actually potentially a better one one in which we try to 
with the robots but we say know what robots good take over all of our work going to start 
something and you talk about this as sort of a virtual reality version of the future where games and 
play an important role so why you sketch out what that might entail jd yeah this is in many 
the trickiest part of the book and probably the part of the book that had the most trouble explaining 
people afterwards so my simple answer to your question is that you probably need to read the sixty pages 
the book that are dedicated to it to understand what saying but try my best to summarize so what 
say in the book is that a stereotypical view of what a virtual reality future might look like and 
is another more counterintuitive view and i favor the counterintuitive view and i think it could be a good 
so the stereotypical view is that a virtual future is one in which we all plug into the matrix 
plug into some computergenerated virtual environment so yeah for those of you who are familiar with it one of 
examples i use in the book is neal novel snow crash where he talks about the metaverse as something 
people spend a lot of time living and experimenting in and i think that that could be understood as 
vision of a virtual future jd but there are some tensions within that insofar as a lot of the 
that take place in computergenerated environments are in my mind quite real in that you have real friendships and 
conversations with people sometimes you can really harm or hurt people in virtual interactions i talk about this phenomenon 
well of virtual assault assaults committed via a computer avatar virtual environment and so not clear to me that 
a virtual world entirely philosophically a strict sense of what virtual would mean so the other alternative view the 
view is that in a sense humans have always been a virtual species this is kind of the counterpoint 
this notion that always been cyborgs also always kind of been virtual in the sense that always used technology 
create insulated environments or niches in which we can survive that are hidden or shielded from a lot of 
world effects right and not talking to you right now in the real natural world so to speak inside 
nicely centrallyheated home sc i mean we manifestly are talking to each other in the real world mediated by 
wonderful electronic piece of technology so i think exactly to your point that maybe not a hard and fast 
between real real and virtual real jd exactly so the counterintuitive view is really that we have been using 
to create environments that are more and more conforming to our desires and needs and are less constrained by 
of the limits of the physical or natural world and we can continue to pursue this trend in such 
way that we have ever more control over the kinds of environments in which we interact and the kind 
vision of the virtual future that i care about a related point here which is that some people argue 
a lot of current existence is a kind of virtual reality game some people like david graeber an anthropologist 
said a lot of work is virtual reality a lot of bullshit jobs to use his phrase i know 
this is a censored podcast so i apologize sc allowed to say that go ahead yeah jd yeah and 
people like yuval noah harari written a few books about this where he talks about religion as being a 
reality game probably a claim going to offend a lot of religious believers laughter jd and also consumer capitalism 
being a virtual reality game that we have to live life the way currently living it kind of a 
constructed fact and it might be a social constructed fact that not a lot of us have control over 
the more control we get over it the more virtual it starts to seem to us and kind of 
sc i think i understand that perspective but it seems to be stretching the meaning of the word virtual 
what is really useful these are all more examples of the social construction of reality and the point being 
is not even reality being socially constructed but the human rules and regulations that we invent are clearly invented 
we invent a whole bunch of different ones depending on the context and we can continue to invent them 
or without electronic aids and so this is a sense of the word virtual reality in which we are 
a little bit more selfconscious about the construction of our ways of living jd yeah so kind of actually 
the point better than ever been able to summarize it myself and so agree that this is kind of 
stretch from how people typically understand virtual reality and why i talked about the stereotypical view initially but i 
think that this counterintuitive understanding of it is more appropriate and again i have a longish discussion of the 
reasons for thinking that in the book but yeah the more selfconscious we are about the arbitrary rules and 
we use to construct our engagement with the world the more of a virtual life living and the kind 
apotheosis of this trend is where we start to realize that everything doing is essentially a game and we 
control over the rules of that game sc yeah when reading your book the word game also struck me 
little bit sort of both narrow and broad definitions of that talked on the podcast about the idea of 
and how important they are but people really these days i think some people are going to think of 
fortnite or something on your computer where a video shoot up kind of game or some sort of matching 
on your smartphone whereas this broader notion of sort of a structured activity with a goal right jd yeah 
where we clearly make up the rules but baseball is a game and knitting is a game and chess 
a game and in some sense the financial markets or universities or novel writing is a different form of 
jd yeah so i think right and i think people will probably run towards this maybe computer game scenario 
understanding of it but i do adopt this broader definition of a structured activity with a goal and also 
one that is dictated or guided by arbitrary rules this is a definition of games that actually comes from 
book by bernard suits a philosopher who wrote an interesting quirky book in the called the grasshopper a dialogue 
dialogue where they talk about the definition of a game and the notion of utopia and so i draw 
on that in the book when i discuss this idea but i so i do think technology plays an 
role in how gamelike our existence can be in one sense which is that technology gives us more opportunities 
construct more kinds of games more control over the arbitrary rules we use to structure our lives jd now 
go back to the point that the financial market is a game in a sense true and something that 
of and work in the modern world could be viewed as a game but what i think is different 
the modern world and the future that sketching is that at the moment work is largely a necessity for 
something that they have to do they have a choice so the future imagining this virtual future is one 
which you actually do have a choice over the kinds of game that you get to play sc good 
that construction that sounds like something good i just want to sort of push a little bit on the 
arbitrary that used to describe the rules of the game i would not call rules of any game arbitrary 
the rules of basketball are not arbitrary we made them up but we made them up with a goal 
mind there are changes to the rules which would clearly make the game worse and there are changes that 
make it better so not like they were random which i think is a sense that people get from 
the word arbitrary jd yeah i know a fair point so i guess contingent in some sense or unconstrained 
some sense so oh well that might not be entirely right either but they are an exercise of choice 
there are better and worse games and more interesting games and a large part of that is the function 
the kinds of rules that we choose to structure our activities sc okay good jd yeah sc so but 
think talking about details too much and not fleshing out the big picture here you have tell us more 
what it would mean to replace our current system of you have to work to earn a salary and 
a living with a world where there were games in some very broad sense of the term that you 
choose to be involved in and that was where you found your sort of daily activity and meaning rather 
in your incomeearning role in life jd right so one part of this conversation which we really touched upon 
part of the reason for that is that i really touch upon it in the book which is that 
saying is contingent upon the notion that people suffering tremendous hardship as a result of unemployment and from losing 
income and so i set that issue to the side in the book and there are interesting debates and 
around things like the basic income guarantee as a way of solving the loss of income that people have 
a result of jobs looking more at this notion of the loss of meaning associated with jobs and how 
could find meaning in another forum sc but sorry so we are assuming that there is either basic income 
some version of that where everyone has enough money to survive and get through the day jd yeah probably 
more abstract in general than that insofar as i would say that we have to have some way of 
the potential deprivation that people would have as a result of losing their jobs the loss of material wealth 
sc right jd you could resolve that through an income that people have to purchase services but there are 
ways in which you could address the loss of material wealth as well which necessarily mean that we all 
an income sc got it jd so that there are different proposals out there for that but yeah yeah 
that to the side and assuming that and then looking at the kind of meaning sc what do we 
with our time then right yeah this is the obvious question like imagine that we had no material wants 
i think just to let the audience know probably you and i both agree that that is a highly 
question that should be discussed but just not the question interested in right here saying if that were solved 
would we do right jd exactly yeah and this this is a thought experiment in a sense a long 
thought experiment about if something was the case what would follow and this is something that got a lot 
back on since written the book which is that i discuss climate change and other disasters that are facing 
and part of my response to that is that no book can be about everything sc fair yeah jd 
just wanted to set some issues aside to explore this kind of space of thinking so the future that 
is one in which we end up really having a choice over the kinds of activity that we pursue 
life and i view these as games we get to kinda choose the rules that apply to our lives 
that be a good thing is one way of thinking about it and would it address the nonincome related 
that we might lose through work so as i mentioned earlier the sense of mastery social contribution community building 
recognition can we find those things in games and i think we can you can get a sense of 
over games a sense of skill over a game over the rules of a game and competency in the 
of a game you can contribute to society through games insofar as you can kind of add to the 
and meaning in other lives by playing games with them you can make their lives better by participating in 
activities you can also gain a sense of social recognition through games in fact one of the main ways 
which people currently gain selfesteem or selfrecognition is through pursuit of gamelike activities and being rewarded for their competency 
games sc or how many likes you get on instagram right a version of a game jd yeah although 
might be a negative version of the game in one sense right and this is one thing is all 
i would be sensitive to discuss maybe a little bit briefly in the book is that not like a 
future in which we all play games would be perfect still be the role for competition and there are 
of scarcity in the world of games that probably correspond to the forms of scarcity we see in the 
world in terms of material scarcity or incomerelated scarcity in that if people care about being the best at 
game a kind of scarcity being the topranked performer jd so there are potential negatives and downsides to playing 
but one thing i like about this vision of the future is that i think it can be a 
for kind of mass satisfaction and appeal and not something that is limited to an elite few people to 
live a meaningful life games are things that can be pursued by everybody it also enables what i think 
an open and dynamic future insofar as that there is a essentially an infinite horizon of games that we 
possibly explore and i think this is something important about thinking positively about the future is that the future 
as much as possible be an open horizon and not kind of stagnant and closed down in some sense 
oftentimes when we have a sense that the future is closed and that society is stagnant that the most 
and dystopianism tends to creep in sc well yeah i think that an attractive picture in some ways but 
do arise that i have and going to give you a chance to take a swat at them and 
one you the issue you just mentioned is one of them you say that an infinite horizon of possibilities 
the flip side of that or at least the counterargument is what if not what if we just get 
what if we sort it turns out that our creativity for inventing new ways to keep ourselves amused or 
or active as infinite as we hoped it was is that something to worry about or something to make 
peace with jd so two things to say here one is that even if the landscape of games infinite 
often a kind a relatively limitless possibility space within individual games people have been playing chess for thousands of 
and a lot of people still find it intrinsically fascinating that lots of room left to explore in it 
though machines are better than humans at it so a human performing chess is still a popular sport sc 
jd so yeah within an individual game often room for exploring lots of different spaces within that game so 
point the other point is that would we get bored and would we kind of run out of things 
think of at a limit of course we would if we lived forever literally if our lives were infinite 
end up doing everything and we might become complacent and bored i just think it seems to me at 
moment a good bet to suggest that lots of possibilities left to explore and lots of new game spaces 
explore insofar as we see lots of new games continually being invented that might not gain mass traction or 
right now but if they become the main focus of our lives then we have the opportunities to explore 
sc i think fair jd so just a bet i would have that unlikely to run out of things 
any kind of meaningful human time horizon at the limit we probably would sc okay maybe a more realistic 
is the following we talked about the social construction of the rules maybe arbitrary but at least we did 
them up and i think that when it comes to more conventional notions of work where building something and 
the end of the day a chair or an automobile that was created by the labor of yourself and 
even if the rules of that social role were made up by somebody they feel like made up by 
they feel natural or they feel necessary or they feel imposed by the constraints of just living is there 
worry that things begin to seem less meaningful to us if the rules are obviously socially constructed like if 
making up rules of games in order for us to play them does that make us less fulfilled somehow 
i can sort of guess the answer but asking the question in a leading way jd yeah this is 
wider debate in the philosophy on the meaning of life which is do you need some external narrative or 
in which your life is situated in order for it to have meaning or do we embrace the more 
existentialist view which is that we get to choose what the meaning is and i tend to favor the 
view but i would qualify it in one sense in that it is of course true that if we 
games we might have an initially specified rule set that is clearly arbitrary but we discover things about the 
that we play that were unexpected or unanticipated given that initial rule set and we might find the need 
add new rules to the game so to speak jd so to use one example the rules of football 
soccer to an american audience include things about players not being allowed to pass the ball directly back to 
goalkeeper at one point in time and the goalkeeper being able to pick up the ball they changed that 
because they thought be more interesting things like the offside rule these have been added to the game over 
because they realized that the initial set of rules sufficiently interesting and that there are aspects of the game 
appreciate until they started to play it more and so there are i think constraints within the world of 
that we initially appreciate and the rulebound nature of games fully transparent to us sc well and i think 
answer you could have given is everyone knows that we made up the rules of football and this does 
stop people from being really really passionately interested in it as a matter of empirical fact jd yeah another 
which is that oftentimes things that are clearly arbitrary as a matter of sociological fact and anthropological fact do 
on an outsized importance in society and actually become the most important thing in a society which is kind 
an odd feature but yeah the fact that they are contingent and socially constructed seem to have stopped anyone 
date from finding a lot of meaning within them sc okay so maybe my most serious question here you 
the fact when talking about work as presently constructed that there are these power structures corporations and wealthy individuals 
inequality that can be exacerbated by the current economic setup do we have any reason to think that be 
as bad in the virtual utopia there at least as much room for power to be concentrated in certain 
and abused right along with it jd so i definitely think there is room for there to be power 
and dynamics and things that need to be addressed so again the point i would make about that is 
the virtual utopia going to be perfect in any sense the hope is just that going to be better 
what we currently have but do we have reasons to think going to be better than we currently have 
think there are some reasons for optimism insofar as if you cut out the material necessity of work so 
one of the reasons why the power dynamics within the existing economy are so meaningful and salient to people 
because people have to work to survive and to live if you cut out that kind of material necessity 
if everyone gets provided with a sufficient amount to have a reasonable quality of life they have more freedom 
to choose the kinds of activities that they pursue the hope is that the power dynamics that might exist 
become less meaningful and less salient to them and this is also one area in which technology can help 
goes back to one of my earlier points is that technology is still part of this virtual utopia in 
technology gives people more options sc okay i do think i get the feeling from our conversation that a 
of that harder than i might have thought to separate out the question of finding meaning in constructed activities 
the question of how do you pay for it and where do the material goods come from i totally 
the intellectual move of trying to separate the question of universal income or the equivalent thereof from the question 
what are we going to do with our time but i suspect that in reality a very strong feedback 
the two of them and going to go handinhand jd yeah no i think fair and i think right 
not going to unlock this utopian future that imagining unless you solve the problems of material deprivation or have 
world of relative abundance for the majority sc sure going to get a bunch of comments on the podcast 
that we could have solved all these if andrew yang had been elected president of the united states but 
missed our chance on that one but i know are you in favor of universal basic income let me 
ask that as an aside i think i am but i think that not close to being able to 
it yet and going to be an incremental move toward it rather than a big leap jd yeah broadly 
a fan of the idea and one of the reasons a fan of the idea actually have anything to 
with technology i think there are lots of interesting ethical reasons to favor a basic income that linked to 
which is just that a basic income allows for more opportunity and freedom of choice in life and that 
to be the main ground on which philosophers have defended the notion the automation narrative has only really taken 
stage in the debate around basic income in the past decade or so but people have been arguing for 
for a very long time for other reasons and if people are interested i have a longish series on 
blog about the philosophy of the basic income where i explore the reasons to be in favor of it 
okay i think given us a lot to think about let me close with a more provocative aspect of 
whole question so we have jobs in the current system we work we get income from that a big 
of our selfidentity of who we are but another big part which is relationships family love friendship things like 
is there a parallel argument about how those aspects of our lives could become virtual whether love or family 
friendship jd well i said two things about that one is that the vision of the future that sketching 
this conversation in the book rule out the idea that have relationships and families and i say this several 
in the book that all those things would still be available to us one issue whether we can have 
relationships and virtual well i think we can and written several papers on this about whether we can have 
friends or robot lovers written quite a bit about this over the years and i think we can under 
conditions i can go into those if you want but that would probably lead to a much longer conversation 
link to your website worry jd just very briefly i define myself as ethical behaviorist when it comes to 
interactions with virtual others or machinelike others in that if they look and act like humans or are the 
roughly as humans in all important respects then we can have meaningful relationships with them so there is a 
for relationships with machines sc yeah i think that your attitude in the book and towards these things is 
very much in favor of namely that it is very hard to predict going to happen but it makes 
the sense in the world to imagine all the scenarios we can imagine because things are changing superduper rapidly 
exactly because we can predict good not to be sanguine good to really try to flesh out ahead of 
what the implications of these things could be and personally be all in favor of disconnecting the need to 
a living from the way we choose to spend our time during the day jd yeah and really it 
about breaking that link what is going to be valuable to us and the other thing i would say 
well just on a final note is that this notion of sketching lots of different scenarios and plans i 
view that as being the main thing that i do which is that i try to imagine different possible 
and evaluate them using different ethical norms and principles so that we get a sense of the broadness of 
axiological landscape into which we are navigating sc better define the word axiological i know what it means jd 
is the study of values the different kinds of values associated with these features right sc yeah i find 
at the end of many of my podcast interviews saying a brave new world things are going to be 
a and i think this is definitely an example of that so john danaher thanks so much for your 
here this was a fun conversation jd thanks a lot sean it was great music i am going to 
a general i really do enjoy listening to the mindscape podcast mainly because it provides a platform to get 
to different personally i think it really matter how sensible the thoughts are of course those you interview have 
high intellectual position in the world what is important is the realization that we get to think and contemplate 
busy life these days allow us to sit and think and enjoy the moments of it is a mind 
for me a way to fill my loneliness by enjoying to listen to people who devoted their life to

and free market chinese authoritarianism seem to be ascendant neither of these values the worker and neither of these 
a ground from which to grow compassionate alternatives to the formal idea of work without practical concrete applications it 
equivalent to dreaming about perpetual motion machines on a side note it is a distant sousing to susy cosmologists 
the higgs would yield a rosetta stone to super symmetries quite a while back john carse published and infinite 
the distinction is roughly this in the finite case the game is rulesbased zerosum player gain is player loss 
game is time limited the aim of playing is of course to win damn that payer b the infinite 
has no goal the pleasure or satisfaction of playing apart there are no rules or only those one imposes

one of the most interesting and controversial with work mr scrooge or gradgrind is that a basic income would 
handily play sorry into promoting the possibility of such creativity which they would say has nothing to do with 
daily grind of wresting food from a reluctant world surely the moral purpose and end of life end of

inferior unrelated matter sean as a grad student at u of waterloo in the late i got the full

objective truth however the skeptical view that knowledge is impossible is so enticing because that definition of knowledge includes 
tautology that there is already knowledge of objective truth available with which to compare that mental state before one
