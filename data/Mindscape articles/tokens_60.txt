episode transcript sc so very happy to have lenny susskind on the podcast to those of you who are 
fans lenny is very well known for his technical work for his popular work for his semitechnical books the 
minimum and within the physics community extremely well known as a storyteller a mentor and a guiding visionary of 
field for those of you who know him in for a treat both the personality that comes through very 
and also the subjects that gonna talk about lenny was one of the founding fathers of string theory he 
done an enormous amount of work in quantum field theory in the standard model but today at the age 
seventyeight he is leading the charge to understand the black hole information laws paradox sc this is the thing 
steven hawking bequeathed to us in the when he realized that black holes give off radiation and if you 
information into a black hole how does that information come back out in the radiation or even does it 
out so lenny like i said is one of the leaders in tackling this problem which is probably the 
biggest clue that we have to ultimately constructing a theory of quantum gravity so this has led people into 
like the adscft correspondence it from qubit a whole bunch of very mindstretchy ideas sc so gonna do our 
in this podcast to bring those mind stretching ideas down to earth to make them understandable and to convey 
of the excitement that physicists like lenny and i because we work in very very similar fields really feel 
days about the progress being made and the prospects for going to come very very soon so buckle up 
is gonna be quite a ride and i think going to like it go music sc lenny susskind welcome 
the mindscape podcast leonard susskind hi how are you sc so one question like to ask of people who 
identified as string theorists is are you a string theorist do you call yourself that ls i really i 
i had a lot to do with it in the beginning and then more recently but i like to 
think of myself as a theoretical physicist sc i think smarter then you can do whatever you want right 
ls yeah you do what curious about and one time i was curious about that the other times i 
curious about other things and i tend to follow where my nose leads sc right just so we can 
it on the record do you have a feeling for the present state and possible future of string theory 
a field ls yeah i think i do i tell and i know if gonna be the call it 
theory of everything i hate that term but use it anyway sc yeah people get it ls whether going 
describe in any of its given forms whether going to describe nature as we know it but i can 
you what it has done provided some very very concrete very very precise let me call them examples of 
models however you want to call them that contain gravity that contain electrodynamics that contain particles that contain fermions 
bosons the various kinds of particles that we have in nature and looks a lot like what we think 
looks like at least when we look in the laboratory we see particles we see gravity we see all 
things and there ls and so what this provides us with is a highly precise mathematical situation where we 
try out ideas and one of the ideas that was most important in all of this was the consistency 
having quantum mechanics and gravity in the same mathematical theory and i think by virtue of string theory and 
spinoffs i think we know with certainty now that mathematically quantum mechanics and gravity can fit together sensibly and 
that is no small thing sc and it might not be our world that we live in but possible 
that space ls it might not be right it might not be but we now know the two can 
together that this idea that there was some breakdown where quantum mechanics and gravity simply could not fit together 
think quite sure that that was wrong sc and one of the great guide stars we have in this 
is the entropy and evaporation of black holes and you wrote a wonderful book that plug the black hole 
written many wonderful books but that was a great one ls no not many sc well okay maybe a 
chuckle ls a few sc blurbed a couple so i have to say wonderful ls no i arguing whether 
i was arguing whether many chuckle sc so what do we learn imagine that the audience has heard the 
that black holes evaporate but know any details and many of us take it that there is some quantum 
lesson here and in particular information from which the black hole is made and not sure where it goes 
how do you think about this puzzle the sort of legacy that steven hawking left us ls right okay 
steven asked a wonderful question it was a deep question it was a profound question not mix it up 
the question of whether he answered it correctly sometimes questions can be more important and leave a bigger legacy 
the attempted answers and i think probably the case with legacy that is question is almost dominating the areas 
physics that been interested in for the last thirty years completely dominating them ls stephen simply asked a very 
question he said something falls into a black hole and the black hole evaporates almost by definition something that 
into the black hole cannot get out of the black hole and so what happened to the information that 
into the black and we can get into all kinds of questions of what we mean by information and 
forth but just basically the ability that in principle looking at what comes out of the black hole is 
possible to reconstruct or fell in in principle given technologies which is way way way way beyond anything likely 
ever have but assume that we have it and physically possible can one reconstruct or fell into the black 
ls and there was a tension there the tension had to do with the fact that in basic quantum 
nothing is ever lost in the sense that if you know the quantum state afterwards you can reconstruct what 
quantum state was before a principle of quantum mechanics and so in that sense nothing can ever get lost 
the other hand black holes were places where things get lost when anything falls past the horizon of a 
hole we were brought up to learn that they cannot get out trapped there forever and so there was 
tension there do they or they get out sc right ls can you to put it in practice what 
meant was when a black hole evaporates it has evaporation products anything that evaporates leaves products coming out a 
hole the products of evaporation of a black hole in principle can you reassemble them and figure out what 
into the black hole as simple as that stephen said on the basis that black holes are places where 
cannot escape from and other people myself included said you have to be able to because basic quantum mechanics 
you have to be able who won i would say quantum mechanics won laughter sc so i wanna bring 
there was a funny little paper by a philosopher tim morton i know if read his paper ls no 
sc but he makes the following point that our notion of time is a little bit subtle in general 
and in particular we could imagine calling the universe both the outside of the black hole and the inside 
the black hole simultaneously in other words the universe is disconnected into the interior of the black hole and 
exterior of the black hole and then you could imagine that time just plugs on and information is not 
in the whole quantum wave function just hidden forever in the black hole like a baby universe is that 
possible resolution that be sympathetic to ls no sc why not ls the black hole evaporates gone sc gone 
some slicing of the universe and sometimes slicing ls well okay in practice in the laboratory the black hole 
gone nothing left not even a little remnant that tells you there was a black hole there all left 
the outgoing hawking radiation the principles of quantum mechanics said that that radiation has to carry the information now 
you wiggle and can you find ways to try to inveigh against that no doubt you can but i 
by your first question had to do about string theory and i told you that string theory provides us 
extremely precise tool which we can investigate these questions in a mathematical context that we have a lot of 
in the answer that comes out of that highly mathematical but precise context is nothing is ever lost from 
black hole sc right everything is still there ls so i think this is a solid conclusion as i 
not a small thing and even stephen even stephen sc he did change his mind eventually yes he gave 
the past right yeah ls in the end yeah sc so one way of thinking about ls yeah but 
did stick to his guns he did stick to his guns sc he was a stubborn guy ls a 
guy sc but he would change his mind once it ls he did indeed sc absolutely clear so one 
that this is often put is if you throw a book into a black hole the laws of physics 
mechanics say that in principle you should be able to measure all of the radiation that comes out to 
the book ls yeah measuring is a loaded term in quantum mechanics sc it is ls we have to 
careful but there is a sense in sc in there anyway whether you can measure it or not but 
information is there ls yeah yeah sc so just go through some of these thought experiments this is after 
a thought experiment just so the audience knows we made any black holes and watched them evaporate right ls 
i know no no we sc yeah we have not so is it possible that somehow when the book 
into the black hole its information is duplicated into the outgoing radiation and we get it that way ls 
an interesting question one model one picture of what happens is as information falls into a black hole exactly 
you said it gets duplicated xeroxed call it one copy falls into the black hole so people who fall 
the black hole with the information see it smoothly pass through the horizon and the other copy is radiated 
out through the hawking radiation and then you it we have our cake and eat it sc yeah we 
our cake and eat it too ls we have our cake and eat it too this is an okay 
i think the problem with it is known in quantum mechanics that you cannot really duplicate information that quantum 
true quantum information cannot be duplicated i thought discovered this fact and i called it the no quantum xerox 
it had been discovered before by a quantum theorist and called the nocloning theorem sc right ls one of 
most central properties of quantum mechanics that you can not faithfully reproduce the quantum state and you duplicate it 
you said so that left us with a funny situation you even at least within the usual rules of 
mechanics save the situation by duplicating the information on the other hand what if you could duplicate the information 
nobody could ever in principle detect the fact that you have duplicated the information now it a little sticky 
should that make us feel better should we care what people can detect ls yeah physics is an empirical 
and you start getting i know i get very troubled when we put mathematical things into a theory that 
principle be detected not saying you should never do that not saying that under no circumstances should there be 
in a theory which are called not empirically confirmable but you should be a little bit nervous about it 
you discover that because of the laws of physics that you already trust that even if you did say 
information it would be the outcome would always be that you will get frustrated in trying to confirm that 
did something bad ls give you an example in a moment okay you might start to worry that thinking 
so the example eisenberg taught us a long time ago that you know both of the position and the 
of the position and the velocity of a particle and you say not why you do a particle is 
a little thing if it has a position then it can have a position at two different times if 
has a position at two different times then it moved from one place to another how can you not 
the velocity at the same time sc that was a good point ls yeah it was a good point 
yet it turned out that in quantum mechanics that no matter how hard you tried to be able to 
both the position and the velocity doing one would always frustrate the other and so we came to understand 
really there is a conflict a tension or whatever you wanna call it between knowing the position and the 
of a particle and that you simply do both you simply do both so best then that your theory 
allow it in principle or better yet that the theory never allow an experiment which can say mechanics say 
particle have a position and a velocity it says nobody can ever detect both of sc yeah okay as 
everettian i would say no such thing as the position or the velocity only the wave function ls you 
say it any way you like sc the same statement yes ls but take the view that quantum mechanics 
any such comprehensive thing as that a particle have a position and a velocity what it says is that 
experiment to design one will always frustrate the other so you ask with a thing falling into a black 
and so forth does it get duplicated or it get duplicated supposing you discover that using the rules of 
mechanics and gravity you will inevitably discover that any attempt to witness the duplication was always get frustrated if 
measure outside you measure inside if you measure inside you measure outside very much like position and velocity then 
say a principle similar to the uncertainty principle that you simply do both and my feeling about it now 
so the thing that would have been imaginable is imagining some literal observer sitting outside the black hole collecting 
radiation from it and then diving in really quickly and reading the book inside saying that happen ls well 
can try to do that apparently not apparently not it always turns out again you always get frustrated if 
wait long enough on the outside to be able to collect this information in the hawking radiation always find 
that by the time you jump in the first copy of it the first clone of it has fallen 
the singularity and is gone sc and you can never get there ls right and this is this is 
a lightweight statement this is based on calculation and geometry and so forth you find out that an attempt 
learn both what fell in and what came out at the same time gets frustrated it takes too long 
learn what came out so that when you jump in what went in has gone into the singularity sc 
and likewise of course if you just jumped in you could read the book but then you ls get 
sc never come back out again right yeah so you get access to one copy of the book but 
to two ls yeah yeah what yeah right sc yeah and so what does this tell us about how 
should think about black holes and quantum mechanics ls well we should think about black holes and quantum mechanics 
a way which is probably not too different than we think about quantum mechanics that you cannot know everything 
mechanically which classical physics tells you that you can know classical physics tells you you can know the position 
momentum of a particle at the same time it tells you that you can know the phase and the 
of an electromagnetic wave worry if you know what all that means it means something you know both or 
least classical physics says you can know both quantum mechanics you have to be consistent you have to be 
consistent use quantum mechanics as it was designed to be used and be very skeptical when your rules when 
principles seem to how shall i running out of sc to lead you to some contradiction or something ls 
well certainly when they lead you to a contradiction then you should be appalled to go back to the 
board but when using concepts which in principle by virtue of the rules of the game cannot be confirmed 
yeah oh okay okay got that point yeah but this does this sounds maybe to the people out there 
this is an esoteric topic dealing with recovering information from black holes which would be impractical anyway but there 
to be very deep consequences for the nature of space and time itself usually we think of information being 
somewhere in space ls yes yes exactly right sc and this is saying that we always ask that question 
yeah not a good question to ask where is the information it may be a good question to ask 
a particular way of gathering that information with a particular protocol for detecting that information where is it that 
will be found but more generally different ways of gathering information may detect may come to the conclusion one 
would say it was here another way would say it was there without any contradiction nobody can do both 
is there any worry that this way of talking gives so much emphasis to observers that being a little 
anthropocentric or something like that that we are putting agency back into physics ls that the expression that wagon 
already left the stable laughter ls well that horse has already left the stable sc left the stable barn 
ls quite sc quantum mechanics ls that was quantum mechanics right sc okay very fair but are i mean 
to get on slight tangents here when it comes to quantum mechanics are you a many worlds person or 
you agnostic about foundations of qm ls yeah i think agnostic is the word sc agnosticism okay ls just 
my old friend richard feynman subject is so confusing i even tell if a chuckle ls he was asked 
the same question what do you make out of the foundations of quantum mechanics and so forth and his 
was is so confusing that i tell if a and i feel that way quantum mechanics always works i 
it will always work i expect nobody will do an experiment that will violate it on the other hand 
are some very very deep and i even know that hard questions to answer maybe unanswerable about the relationship 
call it reality and the mathematical symbols that we use on a piece of paper sc yeah ls and 
share both skepticism of whether a problem there and i share hugh feelings that you should be able to 
quantum mechanics without collapsing the wave function etcetera etcetera so one thing i do think is i think we 
come to the end of the story until we do understand the relation between gravity and quantum mechanics sc 
interesting yeah ls yeah i a sense that i have that too much in quantum mechanics and too much 
gravity seem to influence each other and connect to each other in surprising ways that until we understand that 
perhaps and also connecting with cosmology horizons all of these things that maybe until we understand those things better 
little bit premature to have a final set of answers about quantum mechanics but i know sc yeah okay 
be a while ls my guess is not gonna happen in my lifetime sc i know optimistic working on 
working on it chuckle ls yeah optimistic chuckle sc working hard okay so just to get back to where 
are ls your lifetime i say your lifetime sc no i know but working hard referring to your lifetime 
seem very very healthy chuckle so we have the situation where we want quantum mechanics to be true and 
know some things about black holes and so this leads us to this relatively profound suggestion that information have 
unique location in space and is this basically what you have dubbed black hole complementarity ls yes yes very 
so complementarity in the same nobody could ever figure out what bohr was talking about incidentally but to the 
that we do understand what bohr was talking about it was complementarity pretty much in the same sense that 
about position and information about momentum are complimentary you have both you can have one but not the other 
it depends on what experiment you do so i was trying to use the term in the same way 
used it sc and you are lucky enough that bohr was unclear about how he was using it ls 
bohr was so unclear that anything i sc you are safe ls right right sc and closely related to 
feature of black holes evaporating that also played a major role in which is the holographic principle why are 
holography somehow asks us to think of the entire black hole as either being or living on or been 
on the surface the area around the black hole so why in the world would anybody think something that 
ls well okay the reason is the bounds on how much information can be stored in a region of 
and as sure you know a deep set of arguments that began with bekenstein hawking hooft myself and so 
which concluded mathematically that the amount of information that can be stored in a region of space cannot be 
than the surface area of the region now unusual because normally in most physics you would imagine the amount 
information number of bits that can be stored in a region of space would be proportional to the volume 
the region sc yeah ls normal physics how many sc i am just putting a bit at location in 
so hard about that chuckle ls yeah right put a every bit of information at every point in space 
then your number of bits will be proportional to the volume indeed so hard about that well so hard 
that is wind up putting so much energy into the region of space that you create a black hole 
the black hole will be bigger than the region that you were trying to populate in the first place 
information so using ideas from black holes from hawking from bekenstein and so forth i think hooft and i 
came somewhat independently to the conclusion that you under no circumstances could you ever put more information into a 
of space than its area area measured in little planckian pixels and once you say that you begin to 
maybe there should be some theory in which the interior volume of a region should be described by degrees 
freedom that live on the sc can you explain what a degree of freedom is ls yeah a bit 
information sc a bit of information ls a bit of information yeah and i try to describe what a 
is sc no good zero and one chuckle ls zero and one yeah sc the quantum mechanical version of 
ls the quantum mechanical version of zero and one right that there should be if absolutely impossible that under 
circumstances you can ever contain more than an worth of information again perhaps that means there should be a 
of it in terms of a theory which lives on the boundary that was called the holographic principle when 
first said it nobody understood it all there was a reason chuckle ls no no there was a reason 
wrote a paper that i even know about and it was called dimensional reduction in gravity what he meant 
that dimension goes from three dimensions the volume to the surface area the word dimensional reduction had an entirely 
chuckle ls to most physicists worry about what it meant it meant something entirely different and since i was 
in any way interested in dimensional reduction at that time never even looked at the paper i even know 
it sc well this is a lesson for young people out there you can be one of the most 
physicists but if the names the titles of your papers are not that enticing people are not gonna read 
ls yeah i think true and he was thinking a little bit different than i was but nevertheless we 
to the same conclusion that the maximum amount of information you could put in a volume was its surface 
and therefore there should be a theory of that type where everything is described by a surface set of 
of freedom we call it the hologram i think he even used the word somewheres in his paper i 
put it in the title sc because a real hologram is a twodimensional thing that you shine light on 
yes yes a real hologram is a piece of film twodimensional if you look at it through a microscope 
you see is a bunch of random little dots and data nothing you can make any sense out of 
it encodes full threedimensional information so we both independently called it that i can tell you when the idea 
came out nobody noticed it was hooft at all they did notice when i wrote it okay sc the 
ls why i think i was clearer i think i was clearer hooft was a very famous physicist sc 
prize winner yeah helped establish the standard model for particle physics ls yeah one of my real heroes sc 
absolutely ls right so nobody noticed it they noticed it when i wrote it and i think a lot 
people said two guys used to be good physicists but lost their chuckle ls one of the few people 
really did get excited about it was ed witten he from the beginning caught on to the idea sc 
realize that ls yeah yeah ed witten sc ed witten also to those of you who know like one 
the most respected physicists around ls definitely but the one who really made it precise and made it reputable 
not only reputable turned it from a wild speculation to a almost clearcut consequence of quantum mechanics and gravity 
eventually to a tool when a speculation goes from a speculation to a principle and then eventually becomes a 
of the subject sc progress a catalyst yeah ls progress progress sc and by the it talking about this 
this hologram this hologram sc that all of this threedimensional reality can be encoded on the surface ls on 
surface area yeah that was juan maldacena juan maldacena is now one of the very great physicists in the 
and he again he did not know about our work edward did witten did maldacena actually did not he 
to it in his own strange way from actually from string theory but the result was the same and 
had a very very precise mathematical version of it the one that we call adscft now from string theory 
it was so mathematically precise and so convincing that it became as i said a principle and then a 
of physics sc i think this is sufficiently important and central that you should explain adscft six letters ls 
yeah okay sc two things ads and cft ls so ads is a kind of space time not the 
time that we live in in geometry the geometry of space time and why is it called ads that 
for antide sitter now de sitter was a physicist mathematician physicist from the early parts of the century who 
a kind of space called de sitter space i used to joke that his aunt discovered antide sitter space 
sc de sitter was classified actually as an astronomer ls yeah yeah he was an astronomer sc yeah ls 
he was an astronomer sc but he solved equation for general relativity ls and found the space called de 
space which is incidentally thought to be the space the kind of space we really live in sc yeah 
there ls right but we understand that much less than we understand antide sitter space now antide sitter space 
in some sense the opposite of de sitter space not really the opposite it has certain opposite properties one 
them is positive curvature the other one has negative curvature not like a particle and an antiparticle if you 
them together disappear just in some sense antide sitter space has opposite properties to de sitter space it turned 
that was the one that was most amendable to mathematical analysis sc i think let just interject one little 
piece of information de sitter space is characterized by having a positive amount of energy in empty space ls 
positive amount of dark energy sc right ls and maybe you wanna use that term right i like it 
sc i care dark energy vacuum energy whatever it is but the space itself ls an antide sitter space 
the kind that has a negative dark energy vacuum energy sc suffusing all of space and the only thing 
the universe no particles no galaxies no dark matter just vacuum energy everywhere if a positive number be de 
and negative number which sounds crazy and certainly not what we have in the world but the space that 
get is antide sitter ls right and for reasons which are technical string theory was very very comfortable with 
sitter space and extremely to this day uncomfortable with de sitter space sc yes an ongoing thing like how 
reconcile the observed facts that vacuum energy is possible with what string theory says should be the case ls 
but maldacena simply took started with string theory constructed out of the rules of string theory this antide sitter 
and analyzed it and realized that it had this property that we call the holographic principle he even know 
term and his paper even refer to it ed witten was closely related to the string theory the centers 
string theory who wrote a similar paper and called sc holography ls holography sc antide sitter space in holography 
right so he was very familiar with my work and he was aware of work so reason juan did 
mention it was not because juan has trouble mentioning other work he just know sc no right so you 
based on black holes the speculation that somehow the information was encoded on the boundary of the black hole 
has an example of a specific spacetime antide sitter space where everything that happens in that space time is 
encoded on a boundary with one lower dimension ls oh no in my work and in the black hole 
just the starting point the eventual conclusion is that a region of space no matter in it black hole 
no black hole would be described by such a boundary theory sc right ls but we had absolutely no 
how to build that kind of theory and it really was a speculation i say a wild speculation because 
understood the reasons that we were pushed to it but it did sound pretty out there version of essentially 
same thing was highly mathematically precise and analyzable with theorem proof proof proof sc equations ls equations real equations 
you get to speculate as much equations are governed what you ls i think the number of equations that 
in the hooft paper and my paper altogether a number of relevant equations both papers had a lot of 
most of them were irrelevant the number of equations was very small sc and paper if i remember correctly 
now the most highly cited paper in theoretical physics ls so told right right right sc so this is 
ls many sc so good so maldacena says at least an example we have one theory but two different 
of talking about these two different ways seem utterly different one is no gravity and a quantum field theory 
the other is there is gravity but an extra dimension one higher dimension of space what have we learned 
this weird construction ls what do we ever learn what do we learn we okay tell you what i 
we learned among other things many many things gravity does not seem to be a thing that you quantize 
you what i mean by that ordinary theories like quantum electrodynamics or the theory of harmonic oscillator or the 
atom the quantum mechanics of those theories was constructed by a recipe it was a recipe that was invented 
paul dirac and it starts with a classical theory and then you apply some rules to the classical theory 
quantization and you produce a quantum theory of it ls that never worked for gravity it was the fact 
it never worked no matter how hard you tried you always ran into infinities or information being lost or 
really bad went wrong it was that that made people think that there was this tension between quantum mechanics 
gravity and that there was a conflict between them i think turning out the other way i think the 
is that they are so closely connected so almost the same thing that the idea of quantizing one of 
just it separates them too much it separates them too much from the beginning to say this is classical 
and quantum mechanics when we put them together just too closely related sc so saying in other words that 
theories you can start classically and then construct this quantum theory but the right way to think about quantum 
is just to be quantum from the start ls yes and more than that i think almost all quantum 
have features in them which are reminiscent of gravitational things even though they may have very little to do 
sc so we can find echoes of gravity and curved spacetime ls we can find all sorts of echoes 
of curved spacetime in ordinary simple quantum mechanical systems construction was an example of this roughly speaking he said 
you could construct a sphere of material a sphere of material a shell where the shell had certain properties 
would allow it to be described by certain kinds of quantum mechanical field theories and shells of matter are 
by quantum field theories sc yup that we can do ls if we could construct just the right kind 
in every possible way in the laboratory in the laboratory not in outer space not in the laboratory we 
construct the shell and we could communicate with it by tapping on it listening to what it does and 
forth that for all possible purposes we would discover that what was going on inside contained gravity even though 
we opened up the shell we will find nothing in it chuckle ls very weird very weird sc how 
is this to doable ls i think getting there not gonna build such shells that would not be the 
thing to do we will hopefully we will build quantum computers that can quantum simulate those shells quantum simulating 
that the actual quantum mechanics going on in the quantum computer is a direct reflection of the same quantum 
that went on in the shell or in constructions have these quantum computers we will be able to interact 
them we interact with computers let me not explaining how we interact with computers ls we interact with them 
make measurements on them we look at the screen or whatever what will be going on inside those computers 
be pretty much the same as what goes on in a black hole in a quantum mechanical system that 
gravity so i think i do believe that in the end we will be able to do a certain 
of experiments with quantum computers whose results if we took them literally would say know going on inside there 
black holes all sorts of even though if we opened up the quantum computer all we would find would 
circuits ls so the endpoint here what the endpoint is it may turn out that quantum gravity great theory 
gravity great theory of quantum mechanics but it might eventually turn into a tool for quantum computational science already 
in that direction already very much going in that direction sc so by that we mean building a better 
for a quantum computer to solve some of the problems ls possibly building better algorithms but the one thing 
especially comes to mind is building better error correction error correction is a big deal in quantum computation sc 
back up a bit i think this is very valuable what is a quantum computer and what makes it 
great why is it better than a classical computer ls because quantum mechanics of a given number of qubits 
bit what a bit is a a switch which is either on or off sc zero or one yeah 
a quantum bit which is called a qubit is a quantum mechanical version of that but it has a 
thing than a single bit that can be in a superposition of states not up and not down but 
plus down and so forth sc combination yeah ls so a quantum bit is a more complicated thing now 
bits a collection of quantum bits has enormous capacity for what i call complexity much more so than the 
so the amount of information that you would necessarily have to provide to describe the quantum state of one 
qubits is vast huge but that also means that that one hundred qubits can store an amount of information 
is vastly bigger sc a qubit could be encoded in an electron that is spinning clockwise or counterclockwise so 
hundred electrons sound too hard to hang together and rolled into a machine ls four hundred electrons the amount 
information that it would take to describe the state of four hundred electrons is as big as the maximum 
of information that could ever be put into our entire observable universe if it was packed as tight as 
sc right classical right yeah ls so four hundred sc nothing ls nothing four hundred qubits in principle can 
that much information the question is can you get it out of the computer and this you have to 
very very lucky to design an algorithm where not only can you store and answer questions involving that much 
but also be able to get it out of the computer sc so people are doing it right now 
a couple of qubits at a time and in very simplified situations but if we could make it dozens 
hundreds then a world opens up ls a world opens up and not exactly clear really not exactly clear 
that world is we know that there are a handful of problems that we know that are much too 
for classical computers the buzzword is that exponentially hard problems which are exponentially hard which cannot be solved by 
reasonable classical computer that quantum computers can solve when the quantum computers are built ls also another class of 
which are very interesting which are simulating physical systems quantum mechanical physical systems we build into the quantum computer 
set of rules which is analogous to the rules which say govern a superconductor and then we can examine 
the computer what happens when you do this when you do that you have a lot of control things 
will be too hard to actually do to the superconductor itself so you get to explore changes what happens 
you change the superconductor a little bit this way a little bit that way sc this is one of 
original motivation in pioneering quantum computing ls yeah yeah right absolutely absolutely so a world that may open and 
will probably be a wider class of problems that quantum computers can solve but the problem with quantum computers 
because they have so much capacity for complexity also very delicate little tiny errors that have any significance at 
for a classical bit a classical bit is like a coin which is either heads or tails you put 
coin on the table and you sneeze what happens nothing sc nothing pretty robust ls heads stays heads not 
to error because you sneezed you sneeze on a quantum bit and oh boy chuckle sc entangled it now 
over ls entangled it made a mess out of it okay so that means that have to be extra 
in your protection against errors errors are random flips of bit random errors that classical bits are not terribly 
to and quantum bits are very susceptible to so that means you have to build in redundancy you have 
build into your quantum computer redundancy and error correction called error correction so that if it happens that an 
is made the computer by itself detects the error and corrects it okay one of the really interesting things 
is that possibly one of the most interesting theoretical constructions about error correction happened in the last x years 
come out of thinking about black holes remarkable fact a dialogue going on a very robust dialogue going on 
this kind of gravitational holographic community called the it from qubit community sc it from qubit ls yeah it 
qubit community sc because john wheeler suggested it from bit that reality emerged out of information and saying he 
almost right quantum ls right the gravity people the maldacenas of the world the wittens the thing involved in 
so forth and at the same time the serious hardcore quantum computer community which is technological sc building things 
hardware ls building things right building things with technological purposes in mind and the two communities are beginning not 
beginning for the last i think probably for about four or five years five years now i think been 
very strong interaction between those two communities with lessons learned from gravity or quantum gravity being transported into the 
science and lessons learned from the computer science give you an example we have these things in quantum gravity 
wormholes that connect black holes that can connect black holes if entangled the right way okay sc sure our 
have seen science fiction movies with wormholes in them yes interstellar ls yeah okay is it possible to send 
into one black hole and have it come up the other we always thought the answer was no that 
would violate some basic principles until a few of us started thinking about a phenomena that the quantum computer 
the quantum communication community called quantum teleportation quantum teleportation is a way of using entangled systems to send messages 
are entirely secure and which seem to go from one place to another without passing through the space in 
them we now know that the same phenomena as putting a thing into one black hole and having it 
through the coming out the other one sc okay but just so that the people who are not experts 
grounded here quantum teleportation we can see in the lab that you ls you can do it in the 
sc you can do it yeah ls you see it happen it sc you see the poof ls you 
the information sc but a real down to earth ls oh yeah no quantum teleportation is a real thing 
it sounds a little way out ls no no no it is an absolutely real thing hard to do 
easy to do but it has been done and it will be done more and considered a technology for 
communication sc but nothing actually disappears and then reappears right information that is teleported not like the dog ls 
no information teleported but you put something in one end and it and an equivalent thing comes out at 
other end sc right right ls right called quantum teleportation a real thing and we now know that sending 
through wormholes is this exact same mathematical phenomenon you use it to send things faster than the speed of 
that happen sc still true yeah ls still true and you use it to make time machines sc oh 
bad chuckle ls yeah yeah too bad but you can use it for ultrasecure communication which be detected by 
eavesdropper sc okay ls in principle be sc and so giving me the impression this is not just a 
of enthusiastic theoretical physicists saying cool things that they think quantum computer people should care about saying the quantum 
people actually do care about them ls yeah and a lot of crosstalk a lot of crosstalk look i 
wrote a paper did we actually write the paper together we did the work together sc okay ls with 
computer scientist with scott aaronson sc oh yeah with scott aaronson ls scott aaronson sc future mindscape podcast guest 
done it yet ls right that is something that if you would have told me ten years ago i 
write a paper with a computer scientist i would have said crazy i have no interest in but much 
than that i wrote a paper with him we talk a lot not just scott and myself but dorit 
a whole world who was devoted to the technology of quantum computation has now come together intellectually into an 
community which consists of these gravity quantum mechanics people the quantum information people the quantum computation quantum communication and 
are real technologists sc so two questions i wanna forget either one the first one let me put myself 
the sort of skeptical position here and wonder about how abstract this all sounds like here we are in 
room chairs tables and you were saying that secretly all a twodimensional screen of information chuckle ls yeah sc 
that like how secure established robust is that or is this a bit of a cross our fingers hope 
kind of thing ls again and say it again the importance of string theory to this community and to 
set of questions is that it provided very very exact precise examples in which these things are true does 
mean that they are true of the real world not necessarily sc not necessarily okay ls not necessarily sc 
plausible that it is just ls yeah plausible that it is but a sort of says the mathematics of 
is very very secure no question that this can sc so definitely a useful tool ls right now place 
it yes definitely a useful tool for a number of things but the place where it happens with precision 
in these antide sitter spaces what do we know about the world we really live in de sitter space 
space sc right ls and we know with the same confidence we certainly know with the same confidence that 
rules for de sitter space are the same we sc so is it possible that at the end of 
day all this work ends up being really really useful for people at google who are designing algorithms for 
computers but help us understand the nature of spacetime ls do you wanna tell you friends there that we 
sitting in the google office right now sc for people out there in podcast land actually doing this interview 
an office at google x ls right why because i consult sc for some reason google x thinks that 
physicists are really important as senior consultants so evidence for everything you have been saying right ls right sc 
are computer scientists useful for theoretical physicists do you see the theory of everything emerging from the clouds here 
well i know about the theory for everything learned a new way to think in my old age not 
good at it the computer science way of thinking about things but a lot of what i think about 
days was ideas that were born out of computer science the most important one of which is called complexity 
which turned out to have a direct application in the interiors of black holes sc okay complexity in what 
how does the computer scientist think about complexity ls the complexity you can think of a complexity of a 
or you can think of a complexity of a process but oh of course a thing is also a 
a thing is a process the process of making it from something simple sc okay yeah fair enough how 
you assemble something ls the definition of computational complexity is the number of minimal simple steps that it takes 
go from a to b so if talk about give you some examples of complexity my favorite was always 
i was young i was interested in theorems i prove theorems anymore sc yeah ls right but i was 
in theorems sc for someone else to do ls i was very curious about the fact that some theorems 
hard and some theorems are easy the difference i mean either true or false this hard or easy what 
it mean my teacher my high school teacher told me that the fourcolor map theorem is thought to be 
very hard i said do you mean hard either true or is not true have you make sense of 
idea of hard or easy and i know then i later learned that there were theorems that was so 
that they were true but they were so hard that they be proved period that was mr invention sc 
ls and i got very curious what does it mean to say that a theorem is harder than another 
and it turns out what it means is that more complex what does more complex mean that the minimal 
of steps to be able to prove it not the number of steps that some mathematician might have used 
the absolute minimal number of steps logical operations starting with the postulates and using logical operations andor so forth 
the complexity of a theorem is what the minimal number of steps to prove that theorem is and a 
number given a theorem you can say what the complexity of it is hard theorems are more complex than 
theorems sc and this is a profound statement because a hard complex theorem in this sense might be very 
to state ls yes indeed sc the fourcolor theorem is very simple to state but very hard to prove 
a different notion of complexity ls and the proofs of it involve books worth of equations one after another 
a computer computation so the number of minimal steps to prove the fourcolor map theorem is thought to be 
large compared to x squared plus y squared equals e squared that called pythagoras sc pythagoras theorem yeah ls 
right sc and somehow this illuminates going on in the interior of black holes ls right okay so in 
computation you can say supposing i want to do a certain calculation the minimum number of basic unit quantum 
that it would take my quantum computer to carry out the calculation minimum not the number that designed you 
have used a lousy algorithm sc number ls right the absolute minimum and called the complexity of the calculation 
black hole evolving is carrying out a calculation what does that mean it just means that running sc evolving 
evolving sc its quantum information is evolving yeah ls right quantum information is evolving and one of very exciting 
that for me was to discover that the computational complexity of the evolution of the black hole had a 
meaning in terms of the volume of the interior of the black hole that was very exciting to me 
i always loved the ideas of complexity theory i never thought it would come into physics chuckle ls been 
by black holes been especially interested in their interiors and to suddenly discover that the growth of the interior 
a black hole is a case of growing computational complexity was very exciting is it it is again part 
this dialogue between the computer scientists and the physicists doing these kind of gravitational black hole kind of things 
yeah i expect that that will have some impact sc yeah okay this is all like cutting edge new 
right ls very cutting edge sc it shaken out yet ls and having these two communities some great thought 
come out some great consequence may come out of this interaction and it may be impossible for anybody to 
really figure out exactly what the root to the great thought was it was he said what is what 
said was it what the computer scientist said was getting communities like this together in a situation where they 
do have common interest and enough common tools to be able to honestly interact i think has been just 
very exciting sc and it was part of the thrill of theoretical physics right that we attack problems from 
angles and when they come together we know something smells right ls yeah right and the other thing which 
you think on the right track is when something that been thinking about turns out the same mathematics or 
same set of principles turn up in some other area and turn out to be useful in that other 
really really good stuff usually penetrates into several different directions many directions not just the directions that it was 
for and when that happens you know that something good about what doing so that is happening ls also 
into called condensed metaphysics condensed metaphysics is the physics of materials some parts of condensed metaphysics are now very 
using the mathematics of black holes why black holes are kind of material their the horizons do things they 
viscosity they have electrical conductivity the horizon of a black hole wobbles it does stuff and apparently again turned 
that the mathematics of the surface of black holes turns out to be very similar to the mathematics of 
the mathematics of superconductors the mathematics of other things and that mathematics is being transformed back and forth between 
two communities one of the biggest and hottest items in the gravitational subject is something called the syk model 
okay ls the syk model was first invented by a condensed metaphysicist by the name of sachdev sc s 
s s and kitaev the k is also is a computer quantum computer scientist sc my caltech colleague yes 
they invented this model or at least sachdev invented this model to describe a certain class of materials which 
what are they called lousy conductors sc yeah something like that i know ls crummy conductors sc yeah ls 
bad conductors sc something like that things that not superconductors ls yeah yeah yeah right no not superconductors chuckle 
the opposite ls right and he invented this model for that purpose it turned out that kitaev looked at 
who was not a gravitational person at all and realized from the little bit that he knew about black 
is that this model was describing something like a black hole and now all the black hole physicists this 
the hottest item now syk theory chuckle sc i mean it helps to be as brilliant as alexei kitaev 
yeah yeah yeah yeah sc just to look at this and go that looks like a black right ls 
right right but yes right but think about it it was a material science guy and a condensed metaphysicist 
a quantum computer guy sc found the black hole ls who found the opening and i think a serious 
for new ideas about black holes sc that is amazing ls so what can i say sc a wonderful 
going on ls interesting question how long will it last these kind of ideas and these kind of synergies 
happen they have a finite lifetime they last forever i think this one has probably at least a good 
or fifteen years left in it sc good good advice for the younger people out there the middle aged 
out there ls at least sc okay ls and it will be part of the textbook subject sc yeah 
of course the subject will move on into other things and this one will be the domain of sc 
ls yeah so see sc well let me bring it back to sort of wrap things up here bring 
back to where we started in string theory because another obvious set of questions about gravity and space time 
are the cosmological questions ls oh yes sc the universe and so forth and you alluded cagily to the 
that we should take seriously things that we even in principle observe if predicted by our theories one example 
that is the cosmological multiverse which seems to be part of the string theory story do you still think 
true ls i think so i even wrote a book about it sc yeah the cosmic landscape ls right 
plug that book too ls yeah let me put it this way i think anybody has a better idea 
resolving some of the great puzzles of cosmology the great theoretical puzzles of cosmology in particular the very very 
what are called the finetunings that we seem to see in nature that parameters are extremely finely adjusted and 
know why of course a lot of almost anger at this idea of a multiverse and so forth sc 
felt it yes chuckle ls yeah we both felt it my answer is always what do you have and 
answer is never anybody has anything better so the best idea we have right now for understanding why the 
of nature are what they are we have a better idea and about all i would say about it 
real conviction could it turn out to be wrong i suppose so but i see how to say that 
think it could turn out to be wrong is to say that i see some other possibility and i 
and so just to be clear the in this case is the idea that there are regions of space 
far ls yes yes sc where the local laws of physics look different the multiverse thinking about ls yes 
so a package the idea that the universe is some parts of it we know with certainty we know 
universe is much bigger than the part we can see how can we know that much bigger than the 
that we can see chuckle ls the same way that we know that the earth is much bigger than 
portion that i can personally see sc right ls we know much bigger not because been around the world 
because we see very flat if we go out in a field we see very flat we know that 
going on for a long distance because so flat it probably terminate at the place where we see the 
sc that would be weird yes ls right right that would be weird sc and the universe is the 
way ls the universe is the same way very flat it just seems to go on and on and 
reason to think it stops at what the horizon is so how much bigger at least a thousand times 
in volume so that means a potential for lots of stuff out there that might be somewhat unrecognizable to 
more likely millions and billions and billions and billions and billions of times bigger so to say that the 
things that are possible the only kinds of environments the only kind of behaviors that are possible are the 
that we see in our little tiny patch was presumptuous ls entirely possible that the universe is full of 
kinds of patches with different kinds of behaviors just like the earth is full of different kinds of patches 
jungle desert that there could be a great deal going on out there and so there may be very 
different environments and only a small part of which are habitable which are the parts that are unhabited the 
that are unhabited are parts that are habitable what does it take to be habitable well possibly some very 
numbers sc numbers for the fundamental constants of nature parameters yeah ls for the yeah right so not that 
in the whole universe is all the same and that we could live anywheres in it at least according 
this idea there are just a small tiny fraction of the universe which is of a type that is 
but where are we in the place which is habitable as dumb as that chuckle ls it take a 
philosopher to understand this concept sc and string theory helps us by allowing for all these different laws of 
ls yeah right string theory has many many different solutions where means a possible kind of world with different 
with different numbers and so you take these things the fact that we know the universe is much bigger 
it is than we can see the fact that the parameters seem to be highly finetuned and the fact 
string theory gives more rise to an enormous diversity of different possibilities those are the three things that go 
this idea is it a open and shut game in other words is it done or has the fat 
sung yet no i think so but my usual answer to the critics of it is got anything better 
the almost always no sc it seems to me and maybe ls no i take it back the answer 
always no sc always no so far anyway yes ls yeah sc these wonderful ideas been discussing about qubits 
quantum information and the inversions of space time it seems to me that they yet attempted to address mostly 
questions what happens at the big bang etcetera ls absolutely correct sc is this an open area ls yes 
you think is gonna have a lot of interesting things ls yes yes i think an open area and 
try to predict what the next area will be that will be exciting because usually gonna be wrong something 
come up that you expect but just in the natural course of events if science and if physics is 
to answer these questions got to address that question how do these ideas bits qubits strings and all that 
of mathematics holographic principle adscft or something different how will they address the cosmological questions and i think unknown 
right ls unknown although there are plenty of people who have some ideas and the ideas may be good 
think they certainly reached consensus sc okay and so for my really final question then in addition to helping 
reinvent the nature of space and time and to spending time here at google x with the quantum computing 
also written several books right ls mmhmm sc not only straightforwardly popular books but the theoretical ls yeah sc 
and video lectures what is the way that you think about your activities in that realm how important is 
to you ls an interesting question i did it for two reasons one of them was a emotional response 
my father of all things my father was a very smart man he was a plumber he had a 
grade education he had a bunch of friends they were all plumbers rough characters but they were all intellectuals 
was a long time ago sc what part of new york was it laughter ls the bronx the bronx 
sit around the table i would i was a little kid i would sit around with them talk about 
they would talk about history they would talk about science all kinds of stuff and it was a very 
mix of intellectualism and crackpotism why crackpotism it that they were intrinsically crackpoty particular when it came to science 
was that they had no access to be able to know what was real from what was a bit 
crackpot science ls okay and when i started to get really interested in science i started to try to 
my father it worked i mean i taught him things but i always had this emotional sense of that 
were all these guys like my father out there i would like to be able to teach them what 
science is so know the difference the people i met when i got older that reminded me of a 
bit or they were actually scientifically pretty literate people a lot of the older people that i met in 
community in palo alto these were people from everything from computer programmers to doctors to things like that and 
were very very interested in science they were very interested in physics and generally older ls and at some 
i decided to try to teach in continuing studies program the idea was to teach one quarter and to 
them a scientific american background into some of the modern physics they loved it it was extremely popular the 
quarter and so i went to a second quarter and then a third quarter but it was intended to 
at the level of call it scientific american they came to me at some point and they said with 
scientific american stuff teach us sc us the ls us the real things show us the equations do it 
so i did i think i spent ten or twelve or thirteen years i know how long over and 
teaching courses for these people they courses in the sense of anybody took an exam they were just me 
and sc as the teacher the fun part good you figured it out chuckle ls yeah i did i 
all the fun part and at some point i decided to take the lecture notes and write them up 
books so that was the origin of the theoretical minimum sc are we done is there another volume coming 
ls there will be sometime probably sc okay very good well i completely agree i think right i think 
enormous audience if we do it well to explain science at a pretty good level ls yeah yeah i 
important to explain in an honest level and an honest level allows you to use things like metaphors and 
but you must explain what is a metaphor what is an analogy and you must also explain why deficient 
almost always are sc yeah alright well done a fantastic job at it ls good thank you sc and 
hope the podcast helps sell you some books ls okay sc lenny susskind thanks so much for being on 
podcast ls good okay thank you sean music jackpot a lenny as great as the other lenny at least 
is great not only contentwise but more ny accents in science please bravo sirs excelente diálogo temas bem desenvolvidos

informarme agradeço sean pois como sempre conduz qualquer diálogo de uma forma exemplar agradeço a sr leonard susskind this 
embarrassing but a professional retoucher and huge nerd and got so excited when i saw this episode come up 
my feed i started crying at work and had to explain why thank you thanks lenny and sean for 
great podcast close to my heart i am one of the thousands of middle age people len has educated 
the years with only high school maths and physics to go by i burrowed through the whole series of
