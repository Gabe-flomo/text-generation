show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll regular listeners 
know that been doing a lot of quantum mechanics discussions here at mindscape we talked at great length with 
albert about his skepticism about the manyworlds interpretation i had a flipped podcast with rob reed where he asked 
questions about the manyworlds interpretation we did a little bit on the history of quantum mechanics in the century 
adam becker and of course we mentioned quantum mechanics when we talked to people like leonard susskind or roger 
all of this has a purpose as you might know i have a book coming out in fact releasing 
podcast the day before the new book is due to be published be called deeply hidden quantum worlds and 
emergence of arriving wherever books arrive on september sc and so been getting people excited about quantum mechanics quantum 
is an intrinsically awesome thing to talk about but there is a hidden agenda here that not keeping very 
so podcast episode is the capstone of that effort gonna be a solo podcast just me talking and going 
focus on this issue of how spacetime emerges from quantum mechanics so talked a lot about manyworlds already and 
of the focus of the book but in the book i wanna use manyworlds i wanna just say it 
wanna make the case that it really helps us as physicists to take seriously the foundations of quantum mechanics 
how we make progress on difficult issues like reconciling gravity with quantum mechanics really can depend on what our 
formulation is in particular i wanna argue that if you believe or at least put a high credence in 
manyworlds version of quantum mechanics you can come up with the philosophy that we be quantizing gravity at all 
we should be doing is finding gravity within quantum mechanics sc quantum mechanics is a more fundamental theory than 
relativity than theory of curved spacetime so a quantum mechanics first perspective might help us solve this nutty problem 
this is very very much recent research cutting edge stuff and research that been involved in so i have 
personal perspective not completely unbiased and also of course there are many questions that are unanswered everything that i 
might not be completely wrong but be completely useless in figuring out ultimately how to reconcile gravity with quantum 
but we know yet why we have to try it what theoretical physics is all about very hopeful that 
lessons for how the universe works regardless of whether this particular approach to quantum gravity and emergent spacetime turns 
to be the right one i should also say that there are no prerequisites here okay if you been 
our other discussions of quantum mechanics or discussions of quantum mechanics i will still try to make it so 
everyone can understand going on in this episode of mindscape it is pretty mindbendy stuff in some sense manyworlds 
and this particular emergent spacetime perspective are really as quantum as you can get in the sense that they 
not hang on to any relics from our classical intuitive version of the world as a starting point sc 
start purely quantum mechanical and we try to derive emerge all the classical real world stuff around us that 
an ability not to be an expert in physics or anything like that but to put yourself in the 
of imagining that the world is fundamentally different than you think it is of course like i said that 
not actually be true but the attitude the philosophy that pursuing today so why i think that still useful 
do even if our particular ideas that turn out to be the right ones very helpful very good exercise 
get your brain into a point where you can imagine a world that just seems utterly different than the 
familiar with and to be able to see how the familiar world can emerge out of that so go 
sc i promised that you need to know anything about quantum mechanics to follow this podcast but gonna be 
about quantum mechanics quite a bit so i suppose i should start by telling you what quantum mechanics is 
sadly we immediately hit a problem when trying to explain what quantum mechanics is the problem of what is 
called interpretations of quantum mechanics but a very bad label more like formulations of quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is 
most spectacularly successful theory that physicists have ever devised and yet we understand what it actually says we have 
recipe we have a cookbook for using quantum mechanics in certain particular situations but if you ask but what 
really going physicists do not agree sc and we have multiple very very different formulations of quantum theory quantum 
and quantum mechanics and quantum physics all mean the same thing we have multiple different formulations which all lead 
the recipe they match in other words our experimental predictions for what quantum mechanics says but fundamentally different when 
answer questions about really going on so since not going to be comparing and contrasting all the different formulations 
quantum mechanics here in this episode just going to be talking in the context of my favorite interpretation which 
the manyworlds interpretation sc now manyworlds was formulated by hugh everett back in the it has a bad reputation 
some places because you say there are all these the manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics literally does say that 
you observe a quantum mechanical system the wave function of the universe which is the way that quantum mechanics 
all of reality branches it splits into multiple copies and there are now multiple copies of you one in 
different universe and those universes interact anymore they go on their separate ways so a little mindbendy all by 
not gonna be our real focus here today sc the point i wanna make is that this idea of 
universes many worlds of quantum mechanics the label given to the theory but not the central point of the 
everett nor anyone else start by saying maybe there are many worlds maybe that makes everything make a lot 
rather he took the fundamental ingredients of quantum mechanics and stripped them down to their bare essences so let 
explain what those fundamental ingredients are and then you will see how manyworlds pops out of that this is 
to be very very quick but i think it will be enough to understand going on when we talk 
explaining quantum mechanics we always go down to elementary particles pick an electron one of those little particles that 
the nucleus to make an atom and the reason we do that is because where quantum mechanical effects are 
obvious the whole world is quantum mechanical you and i obey the rules of quantum mechanics but we notice 
mechanics the rules set up by isaac newton fma positions and velocities and on the basis of the forces 
on a system you can predict gonna happen next newtonian mechanics is a really good approximation to the world 
see it only fails to be a good approximation when we look at microscopic systems like individual elementary particles 
and the point is that in classical mechanics in newtonian mechanics if you had a particle what is that 
object that is pointlike it just has a certain location in space and isaac newton would say it also 
a velocity through space and if you tell me the position and the velocity of a particle telling me 
state telling me all the information i need to know to predict what will happen next if you know 
other forces acting on the particle caused by other particles out there or fields or whatever you can predict 
entire future of the universe this is called the clockwork universe demon if ever heard of that concept laplace 
laplace the french mathematician and physicist said that if there were a demon that knew everything about the current 
of the universe he could predict the future and retrodict the past with perfect accuracy he actually say demon 
said vast intelligence but you know what we mean sc so the newtonian classical universe how is quantum mechanics 
you might think that quantum mechanics adds a certain fuzziness to the classical picture quantum mechanics says that when 
predict the outcome of an observation we know exactly what going to see everyone agrees on that that is 
part of the quantum mechanical story so unlike classical mechanics if i knew exactly the position and momentum of 
particle i could predict gonna happen next and i could tell you what measurement outcome i would get in 
mechanics i cannot even in principle make absolutely reliable predictions for any observation i want to make so if 
started your brain with a classical intuitive perspective there are particles they are moving in some way you might 
about quantum mechanics as just adding some uncertainty some fuzziness to that and a big part of the popular 
of what quantum mechanics really says but actually deeper than that and the manyworlds perspective this is where it 
in sc in quantum mechanics the position and velocity of a particle not just that you know what they 
or you predict what you will measure them to be that they exist positions and velocities are not what 
the state of a particle in quantum mechanics what does quantify the state of a particle is something called 
wave function and we think about the wave function as kind of a cloud of probability that is concentrated 
certain regions and the wave function is the answer to the question i observe a particle the probability going 
be that i see it doing different in fact technically something called the born rule in quantum mechanics which 
the probability of a measurement outcome is the wave function squared so intuitively we might think that the wave 
is somehow capturing our ignorance not exactly sure where the particle is or how fast moving but if hardcore 
it if a manyworldser you say not about ignorance not about us not knowing something about the particle the 
function is the entire state of the again other formulations of quantum mechanics will disagree about that but manyworlds 
pure lean and mean and austere it says a wave function and there is nothing else sc so the 
feature of this version of quantum mechanics is that what you see when you measure a quantum system is 
very different from what really exists when not measuring it what you see is indeed a particle with a 
with a velocity those are the possible measurement outcomes but really there is this spread out wave function this 
of probability and the rules of quantum mechanics tell you how to relate really there the wave function the 
out thing to the possible observational outcomes now as human beings we struggle with this we want there to 
a distinction between what we see and what really exists we privilege what we see what we see seems 
and tangible to us and why some of these alternatives to manyworlds have been proposed they try to make 
connection between what we see and what is real much more vivid and direct so even though manyworlds is 
austere and pure and simple a big distance between the formalism of manyworlds and the reality manyworlds is just 
statement that there are quantum wave functions what reality is a quantum wave function and those wave functions evolve 
to an equation which we call the schrödinger equation named after erwin schrödinger sc so exactly like newtonian mechanics 
state in newtonian mechanics the state is the position and the velocity in quantum mechanics the state is the 
function and an equation in newtonian mechanics laws which tell you how particles move in quantum mechanics the schrödinger 
the difference is that if you take the schrödinger equation seriously you find as hugh everett pointed out that 
world branches it splits into multiple copies that did not happen in newtonian mechanics it necessarily happens according to 
schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics sc now you might think if that were true why every version of quantum 
a manyworlds and the answer is that other versions of quantum mechanics work hard to get rid of the 
worlds the other worlds the multiple copies of the reality around us are clearly predicted by the existence of 
functions in the schrödinger equation that was not put in by everett it pops out of the formalism other 
of quantum mechanics say we like that not what the world seems like to us so we will get 
of the other worlds one way or move is as much therapeutic as it is physical he says okay 
there are other worlds we live in one of them at any one time and we should deal with 
therefore the fundamental underlying formalism of everettian quantum mechanics is way simpler than any other possible theory but it 
a challenge if the fundamental nature of reality is some abstract quantum wave function not stuff with positions and 
then how do you go from that abstract quantum wave function to the world we see after all for 
of years classical mechanics served perfectly well to describe the world you need quantum mechanics to fly a rocket 
the moon the moon is there you can see its position its velocity and you can get there sc 
this huge question that becomes important if you become an everettian which is why does the world look classical 
all why was ordinary newtonian mechanics ever thought to be a pretty good approximation to what the world does 
a slight shift of emphasis here that professional physicists will perhaps appreciate but the person on the street might 
exactly because so used to the classical world even after been taught quantum mechanics even after taught our students 
it means to do quantum mechanics and do the calculations and so forth we still help but being classical 
in our bones when we construct a quantum mechanical theory whether a theory of a single particle or the 
model of particle physics or whatever you wanna think about we typically start with a classical theory and then 
quantize it sc there is a procedure there are different procedures actually that are sort of complementary to each 
but there are ways of starting with a classical description and constructing the analogous quantum mechanical theory of it 
the process of quantization now we can do that right we can do that it might be hard it 
hard for quantum electrodynamics why it took a lot of time and people like feynman and schwinger won the 
prize tomonaga there can be subtle issues that arise when you start with the classical theory and start to 
it but if you are a good everettian you think that even that very first move is probably kind 
wrongheaded because the world classical classical mechanics is not there at the foundation of reality the world is fundamentally 
sc what we should be doing is not starting with some classical description of the world and quantizing it 
we should be doing is starting with a quantum description of the world and extracting some classical approximation where 
word emergence comes in and when we talk about the emergence of spacetime not emergence like a little baby 
emerges from its egg not something developing over time the fact that we have a fundamental description in this 
a wave function of the universe and an approximate description that describes what happens under certain circumstances and we 
that the higher level emergent description so even though the fundamental rules of everettian quantum mechanics are very simple 
task that it faces us with is very hard given something very abstract and hard to conceptualize a wave 
of nothing at all just the abstract idea of a wave function and then supposed to figure out afterward 
that is a wave function of in other words what is the best way that we can talk in 
classical vocabulary about this quantum mechanical theory that we have sc so when we look around us we see 
world like i said that looks pretty classical there are people there are tables and chairs there are planets 
stars and so forth not only do we look and measure that these things have positions and they have 
but those positions and velocities more or less obey laws they obey more or less the classical description that 
came up with why is that true i will pause to parenthetically mention here that when as professional physicists 
we teach quantum mechanics to our students or undergraduates who typically take quantum mechanics in their second or third 
as physics undergraduates we completely lie to them we do a very very bad job of explaining how the 
world emerges from the underlying quantum description and part of that is that even we physics professors still think 
the emergence of a classical description is sort of natural to us so we try very hard to justify 
right not a surprise that classical mechanics work we see it working all around us all the time sc 
consider a single electron what we do when we do quantum mechanics we take single particles as i said 
wave function for that electron in principle it could be spread out anywhere but you can say start the 
function of the electron so localized somewhere a place in the universe where the electron more or less is 
you wanna say it this way you could say i to observe it with very very high probability i 
find it localized in this particular and you can ask if the electron is not bound inside an atom 
anything like that what is the prediction for how the electron should behave if it were a classical particle 
would say me its position tell me its velocity i will trace out its trajectory through like throwing a 
seeing it fly through the air the schrödinger equation is the analogous quantum mechanical equation that says how the 
function of the electron will change and the answer is it spreads out everywhere it does not travel on 
welldefined classicallooking trajectory this was of great disappointment to erwin schrödinger himself he was hopeful that his equation would 
that wave functions would be kind of particlelike in their behavior the truth is the opposite wave functions want 
spread out all over the place sc so for a single electron kind of no such thing as a 
limit single electrons by themselves do not act classically at all what we teach our students is fine but 
you get together a large number of particles if you get a macroscopic system like a grain of dust 
there in interstellar space that has many many atoms in it then once you get that large number of 
things begin to act that is a complete lie at least as we say it true that things do 
classically but not just because a large number of particles in there when you have that dust grain out 
the middle of interstellar space you could easily analyze that dust grain by thinking of its center of mass 
the position of the dust grain and its center of mass velocity and then all the jiggles of the 
electrons and nuclei within the dust grain and you can ask from the schrödinger equation what should the center 
mass of the dust grain do and the answer is it should spread out all over the place not 
it should follow some classical trajectory at all sc so why in the world if all true and we 
to our students why in the world do things look approximately classical why does the moon follow its classical 
trajectory orbiting around the earth the answer is that the moon or the dust grain or the electron is 
out there all by itself that there are many many things in the universe and this is a crucial 
of quantum mechanics that is fundamentally different from the classical picture of the world in the classical picture of 
world there can be many things out there in the universe there can be many atoms and electrons and 
and so forth but you can treat them all one by one you can treat them all individually you 
say well this atom is doing this this particle is doing that other thing sometimes they will interact with 
other and bump into each other and fine but the state the intrinsic nature of each particle is a 
thing in quantum mechanics that is no longer true you might guess well an electron it has a wave 
a proton it has its wave function another electron with its wave function no that is not how quantum 
works there are not separate wave functions for every particle in the universe there is only one wave function 
if we wanna be grandiose we can call the wave function the wave function of the universe but the 
function no matter what kind of system looking at is of the entire system all at once okay so 
you think of the wave function in the classical prequantum mechanical way of asking questions if you said well 
the wave function does is it tells me the probability of observing different measurement outcomes then the wave function 
the universe says i were to observe everything in the universe all at once what is the probability i 
get different measurement okay and if you just simplify your life by saying okay forget the whole universe just 
two particles right so you could have one particle that has a wave function that you might think has 
wave function it could be a little bit of a probability to see it over there a little bit 
a probability to see it over here and another particle likewise that has different probabilities sc but the combined 
can be entangled the word entanglement is crucially important in quantum mechanics and what it can say is you 
you were to observe the positions of these two particles you might not know ahead of time what going 
observe there might be a probability of seeing this over here or over there but the wave function of 
whole system can have the property that if you observe one particle in a certain position then you know 
where the other particle is going to be if you observe the first particle in a different position the 
particle would also be in a different position entangled with each other you predict exactly where either one will 
observed but you know when you observe one where the other one will be this is a feature of 
fact that they have separate quantum states just the quantum state the wave function for the entire universe okay 
this seems like maybe a bit of a technicality like sure true everyone who knows quantum mechanics appreciates that 
i just said is true and yet we really emphasize it when we teach quantum mechanics to our students 
can take an entire onesemester introductory course in quantum mechanics and never really hear about entanglement and i think 
that is a crime personally i think this is a disaster i think that we do our undergraduate students 
incredible disservice by deemphasizing the role of entanglement in quantum mechanics and this is why one of my many 
for the next few years is to write a new textbook for quantum mechanics for undergraduates because i think 
entanglement should be absolutely front and center entanglement more than anything else is what makes the quantum world different 
the classical world sc so get back to our little dust grain our little dust grain floating through empty 
why does it seem to follow a more or less classical trajectory and important we go through all the 
sorry about that equations involved not gonna be able to do everything what i wanna emphasize right here is 
an important part of the answer to that question comes from the fact that the state of the dust 
becomes entangled with the rest of the world in particular there are photons filling empty space such as the 
microwave background photons left over from the big bang these photons keep bumping into the dust grain and when 
bump into the dust grain the state of the photon becomes entangled with the state of the grain sc 
we are not keeping track of the state of all those photons we do not know the position or 
wave function of every single photon in the cosmic microwave background ignoring the effects of the photons they change 
momentum of the dust grain a lot the dust grain is a big massive thing the photon is a 
tiny ignorable thing but the dust grain rather is constantly being monitored constantly interacting with the set of all 
these photons all everywhere in the universe that are bumping into it and that constant monitoring branches the wave 
of the universe and on every one branch it will look to a very good approximation like the dust 
is following a classical trajectory this monitoring this fact that the macroscopic system the dust grain becomes entangled with 
environment as we call it all of the other photons or all the other things you keep track of 
the universe called decoherence the reason why the world often looks approximately classical is because what should be a 
function spread out all over the place is monitored by the environment and decoheres and different parts of the 
function go their own separate way sc so rather than treating the dust grain as something that is in 
sense spread out everywhere on every branch of the wave function on every individual part of reality it looks 
us like the dust grain is following a single classical trajectory and true for you or me or the 
or the stars or any big thing in the universe any big macroscopic system in the universe we are 
being monitored by the rest of the universe by the environment and in every one part of the wave 
every world things look approximately classical and all ultimately because of entanglement okay rant over that was just me 
to get it off my chest complaining about how badly we do when we teach people quantum mechanics as 
get back to the task at hand which is trying to understand how the natural world the world that 
observe with our eyeballs emerges out of this abstract quantum wave function sc clearly decoherence and entanglement are going 
play a huge role but many different ways that different quantum mechanical systems can become entangled with each other 
be a little bit more specific and home in on why we see this particular kind of world and 
answer i wanna give away the answer and then justify it is basically because of the feature called locality 
in this sense says when two parts of the universe say two photons or two electrons or two particles 
any sort when they interact with each other they interact with each other when they bump into each other 
at least when very very nearby in space that might let me just step back a little bit you 
think look the sun is far away and yet the earth feels its gravitational pull so not right next 
each other what is this feature that calling and true but a gravitational field that stretches from the sun 
the earth the sun does not interact directly with the earth the sun interacts with the gravitational field at 
position of the sun and that interacts with the gravitational field just a little bit further away from the 
which interacts with a gravitational field just a little bit further away than that all the way up to 
earth sc the field theory that we use the theory of the gravitational field is of course general theory 
relativity the best theory of gravity we have right now einstein says that space and time kind of have 
life of their own they have a geometry and that geometry changes over time in the famous words of 
wheeler tells spacetime how to curve and spacetime tells matter how to so a give and take between matter 
energy in the universe and the gravitational field around it as specified by the curvature of spacetime so even 
gravitational force obeys this idea of locality you interact with something when you are at the same position as 
other thing is and you might think how else could it and like else would it be when you 
with sc but think about that newtonian version of the world think about classical mechanics i told you that 
state of a particle is its position and also its velocity but two particles interact when their positions are 
same or nearly the same they interact when their velocities are the same or when their velocities are opposite 
that they add up to zero or anything like that velocities have nothing to do with it something special 
the idea of position position is the thing that determines the fact that interactions happen when things are nearby 
each other in other words position determines whether two things are going to interact with each other directly or 
a good example of this in the quantum mechanical context is the famous cat all heard of cat schrodinger 
you put a cat in a box you hook up a complicated quantum mechanical experiments so that there is 
probability that poison gas will be released and kill the cat and absolutely no reason why it needs to 
poison gas in my discussions of cat i like to make it sleeping gas so we can just put 
cat to sleep no reason to kill the cat we need to be violent in our physics thought experiments 
but the point is everyone agrees who does quantum mechanics that if you have some radioactive source say that 
going to either admit a particle or not a probabilistic statement but really what the quantum mechanical description says 
that there is a wave function and part of the wave function says this nucleus of an atom has 
a particle radioactive or it emitted a particle yet and the thing about quantum mechanics is the thing about 
functions is that you can exist in a superposition why a wave function is not just a wave characterizing 
ignorance not that you know whether the nucleus has emitted a particle or not that quantum mechanics says the 
of the nucleus the state of the wave function of the universe is that part of it describes a 
that has emitted a particle and part of it has described a nucleus that has not emitted a particle 
both parts are real and in other versions of quantum mechanics part of the wave function goes away magically 
in everettian quantum mechanics they both remain real there becomes a world in which the nucleus has emitted the 
and a world in which it has not sc so in the cat thought experiment what schrödinger was trying 
do was to bring into question whether or not quantum mechanics made sense you might think schrödinger is one 
the founders of quantum mechanics of course he thinks quantum mechanics makes but schrödinger like einstein always wondered whether 
not quantum mechanics was really the final story it seemed to lead to some kind of weird counterintuitive results 
what schrödinger does in his thought experiment is figure out a way to get that wave function of the 
that is gonna either radioactively decay or not and amplify the uncertainty in it amplify the superposition to include 
macroscopic system like a cat so if on the branch of the wave function where the nucleus decayed then 
hammer fell the gas is dispersed through the box and the cat falls asleep because sleeping gas now and 
the other branch of the wave function none of that happens and the cat is still awake sc so 
says in the box before i open it up and look a superposition of the cat the cat is 
asleep nor awake in a superposition of both possibilities and then again schrödinger says according to the conventional rules 
quantum mechanics when i open the box i observe inside and crucially i never observe a cat in a 
of being awake or asleep i either observe the cat awake or i observe it asleep the traditional formulation 
quantum mechanics says because the wave function collapses when you observe it says wave function was in a superposition 
awake cat and asleep cat before you opened the box but when you opened the box you looked at 
you performed an observation and the wave function changed suddenly and this is in complete contradiction to what the 
equation would say happens sc this idea of the collapse of the wave function upon making an observation is 
the heart of called the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and it is what has bothered physicists and physics 
for generations now after all what do you mean an of inside the box does it have to be 
human being making the observation what if another cat observed it does the cat in the box observe itself 
that count what about a video camera what if you observe it very all these questions that are left 
ambiguous in the conventional copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics sc so the alternative well whatever it says is that 
the cat can be in a superposition of awake and asleep but you the person opening the box are 
a quantum mechanical system you are part of the wave function of the universe and what happens when you 
the box is that not the wave function collapses but rather that you become entangled with the cat there 
part of the cat the part of the wave function that says cat is and part of your function 
says have seen the cat be also part of the wave function that says cat is and part of 
wave function that says have seen the cat and those different parts of the two different wave functions are 
with each other in the big wave function of the universe so one branch in which the cat is 
and you saw it awake and another branch in which the cat is asleep and you saw it asleep 
both of those branches are absolutely real and again the existence of these two branches is simply predicted by 
schrödinger equation not made up not added in in any way it just results from taking the schrödinger equation 
and taking the fact that you are a quantum mechanical system and can become entangled with the cat also 
seriously sc so fine as far as it goes but now that talked a little bit about decoherence we 
do a little bit better at that description the wave function of the universe really branch when you opened 
box it branched as soon as the cat became entangled with its own environment after all in the box 
these photons and these air molecules and so forth parts of the environment we keep track of as soon 
the cat became entangled with that which is right away which is incredibly fast then the universe branched into 
different pieces and you were already on one branch or the other even before you opened the box even 
you know it so that is how an everettian would describe cat sc why am i pausing to describe 
in the middle of talking about entanglement and the emergence of spacetime because we can still ask the question 
is it that when we open the box we see either the cat only awake or asleep said because 
become entangled with the cat but why do we become entangled in that particular way either a cat awake 
i saw the cat awake or a cat asleep and i saw the cat asleep in quantum mechanics if 
doing the math if just writing down what the wave function could be there are awake cats there are 
cats but also any superposition of awake and asleep i said before we never see superpositions and so now 
can start confronting the question why not why we just obey the rules of the universe open the box 
see the cat in a superposition or for that matter why we believe ourselves to be in a the 
function collapses would be the traditional copenhagen answer the wave function branches is the everettian answer but it branches 
a very particular way sc so why is it in other words that on individual branches of the wave 
we either see an awake cat or an asleep cat not some combination of both and the answer is 
lies in two things already discussed one is decoherence and the other is locality so think about those particles 
the box the photons the atoms that we said keep bumping into the cat and therefore decohering its wave 
branching the wave function of the universe well if the cat is asleep a certain way that certain photons 
the box will bump into it when you take a picture of your cat what actually taking a picture 
is the photons that have bumped into your cat and entered your camera or your phone or whatever and 
would bump into the cat in a different way if the cat was awake and walking around if you 
a picture of your cat awake you see it somewhere different than if asleep not of course strictly true 
the cat metaphor is getting away from us a little bit because an awake cat can look very very 
like an asleep cat sc imagine for the purposes of this thought experiment that the awake cat is up 
meowing and wants to get out of the box and asleep cat is in a different position lying on 
floor of the box peacefully snoring so the thing about the awake cat and the asleep cat is that 
describe different positions in space and therefore the photons that bump into them are different a photon bumps into 
cat when it arrives at the position of the cat or at least the position of the fur or 
like that and the set of photons which bumps into the awake cat will be different than the set 
photons that bumps into the asleep cat that is why these two versions of the cat that are observable 
will see an awake cat or you will see an asleep cat you will never see a combination of 
if the cat was in a superposition of awake and asleep as soon as any photons hit it they 
know did i hit the awake cat or did i hit the asleep cat or both or neither or 
and the universe would branch but on any one branch when i have a cat that is asleep all 
photons are hitting in the same way not further extra branching over and on top of that sc so 
reason why according to everett or at least according to everettian quantum mechanics the reason why you see the 
as either awake or asleep is because those are the two possibilities that are spatially coherent those are the 
possibilities that describe a system that has a welldefined configuration in space and why is space so important here 
not about outer space i mean the space in which we live the three dimensions of space up down 
right forward backward space is important because interactions such as the interactions of the photons with the cat are 
in space so there is a deep deep connection between locality which is a feature of the laws of 
and the emergence of the classical world the emergence of the fact that when we open boxes we see 
awake or asleep but not a superposition of both locality and the process of decoherence that together make the 
look approximately classical to us so a crucially important fact what locality is doing for us helping decoherence proceed 
a particular way to give us a particular classical world sc now all of that of course does what 
said we really wanna do it starts with classical notions like locations in space and uses those to develop 
picture we ultimately want to go the other way around we wanna presume the existence of space and particles 
anything like that because in the fundamental way that we have of talking about reality according to everett what 
world is is a quantum mechanical wave function sc the world is not particles and fields spread throughout space 
are what we see when we observe the world but the world is much richer than that the world 
this quantum wave function in this very abstract highdimensional mathematical space okay we want to make the journey from 
abstract quantum mechanical wave function to the world that we see what arguing is that a crucial role is 
by the fact that interactions are local in space but a cheat a little bit using the notion of 
and supposed to be deriving the notion of space okay the trick is to just reverse the logic rather 
saying interactions are local in space what you should say is space is the property with respect to which 
are local okay a little bit of a mindbender right there but gonna be the fundamental driving idea that 
us talk about how space emerges from the wave function in other words we have some abstract quantum mechanical 
we even have the vocabulary for this thing in ordinary natural language in the english language we have a 
wave function sc technically for the mathematically inclined out there it is a vector in a gigantic mathematical space 
hilbert space and when i say gigantic you know how we have three dimensions of space around us up 
left right forward backward any vector space has a certain number of dimensions the number of dimensions of hilbert 
is at least ten to the ten to the a very very big number okay a one followed by 
number of zeros and that number of zeros is ten to the which is one followed by one hundred 
zeros a huge number and maybe hilbert space is actually infinitely big we know about that but we wanna 
from this incredibly abstract mess to the specific idea of particles moving in space and what saying is that 
the emergent space the thing that makes space special is that interactions are local in it sc so what 
wanna do in other words is say of all the different ways there might be in principle to describe 
abstract crazy quantum state this wave function there will be certain special good waves the good waves are those 
make manifest the idea that different parts of the wave function interact with each other only when they are 
and again reluctantly even saying those words because gonna be defining nearby to be when the things can interact 
each other okay so let me stop a little bit to give one little footnote here this is already 
and hard to follow enough i mentioned that hilbert space the space of all possible quantum wave functions is 
very highdimensional it might be infinite it might be ten to the ten to the or it might be 
number in between but i will be assuming further more that finite okay this is a big assumption this 
number that is finite is the dimensionality of hilbert space the number of completely independent quantum wave functions that 
can possibly contemplate a huge number but still a finite number that is by no means settled as a 
fact about reality physicists do not know whether hilbert space is finitedimensional or infinitedimensional we do not know whether 
is only a finite number of different possible quantum wave functions that are independent from each other or whether 
an infinite number okay sc the reason why you might think a finite this would take a whole podcast 
talk about and i did talk about it a little bit with lenny susskind but it all comes down 
the entropy of black holes black holes stephen hawking pointed it out all the way back in the have 
entropy and entropy you know is a way of characterizing the messiness the disorderliness the randomness of a system 
the black hole entropy like the entropy of any other quantum mechanical system in some ways is telling us 
number of different possible arrangements of that system that are contributing to the macroscopic reality of the system all 
different possible arrangements that matter for this particular thing sc so two things about black holes that are very 
one is they are maximum entropy configurations for any one region of space if you take a region of 
and try to fit more and more entropy into it eventually the more entropy is associated with more energy 
the whole thing will just collapse to make a black hole and the black hole will always have equal 
or more entropy than the stuff you made it out of in fact it always has more as a 
of fact sc so if you try to fit more entropy into a region of space than a black 
would have all you do is get a bigger black hole that fit into that region anymore so this 
to be telling us that according to gravity which is necessary for making black holes only a finite number 
different states that you can ever have in a region of space which we turn quantum mechanically into the 
that a finitedimensional hilbert space only a finite dimensional set of different quantum states that could possibly describe what 
happening okay so that finite number of degrees of freedom if you wanna call it that a finite number 
things that could go on in any particular region of space that is a completely different conclusion than you 
reach in conventional quantum field theory sc and you know those of you that have been listening to me 
for many years know that quantum field theory is the way the best way that modern physicists have of 
the world if you wanna talk about the standard model of particle physics the higgs boson quantum electrodynamics quantum 
these are all quantum field theories they start with the idea a field in space and they quantize that 
they follow this paradigm of starting with a classical description fields moving through space and quantizing it it is 
true when you quantize a quantum field theory the resulting space of wave functions is infinitedimensional there are an 
number of things that can go on when you have a field theory because literally the field has a 
value at every point in space and an infinite number of points in space really just that simple sc 
i want you to figure out what is being said here kind of big and important on the one 
our best current way of describing the world is using quantum field theory quantum field theory directly implies that 
are an infinite number of degrees of freedom in any one region of space an infinite dimensional hilbert space 
you need to describe all the possible quantum wave functions on the other hand remember gravity fit into quantum 
theory gravity general theory of relativity is the one part of modern physics that seem to be able to 
described by an ordinary quantum field theory and i mean the reasons why true is because both technical problems 
blow up and become infinity and also conceptual problems sc typically in quantum field theory you say things like 
just said right there are fields that have values at every point in space if you try to quantize 
gravity describes spacetime as having curvature and if you quantize gravity presumably that means that a superposition of different 
that space and time could be in but if true we know how to describe point in what you 
finger as a single point in space around you right now might be in a different location or might 
even be mappable to a single location in some different part of the wave function of the universe sc 
is my feeble attempt at making understandable in real language the fact that quantum gravity makes locality very very 
to talk about because points in space be singled out in any simple way anyway the point of all 
was to say there are both technical problems and conceptual problems with quantizing gravity that means that quantum gravity 
not well described by a quantum field theory so on the one hand quantum field theory says there are 
infinite number of states possible in every region of space gravity seems to say there are only a finite 
of things that can possibly happen in any region of space and the number ten to the ten to 
one hundred twentytwo comes from the fact that our universe only has a certain observable part of it right 
universe is expanding and the expansion of the universe is accelerating so if a black hole has an entropy 
therefore a finite number of things that can happen inside because a horizon around the black hole and the 
of the black hole is just the area of that horizon in planckian units sc well guess what we 
the universe are inside of a horizon because our universe is expanding and accelerating there is a horizon around 
and an entropy of our observable universe that turns out to be about ten to the one hundred twentytwo 
you go through the numbers so if this gravity hint is pointing us on the right track the observable 
only has a finite number of things that can possibly be happening within it a finite number of degrees 
freedom a finitedimensional hilbert space very different from the quantum field theory story and to be perfectly honest this 
a fork in the road for physicists who would like to quantize gravity one fork in the road says 
hints from black hole entropy that the number of degrees of freedom is finite in the universe are just 
misleading quantum field theory is more successful than anything we know about gravity we should follow down the road 
quantum field theory and imagine there are an infinite number of things that could happen in any sc but 
whole way to go which says quantum field theory is only a pretty good approximation quantum field theory takes 
very seriously puts it front and center fields exist throughout space quantum gravity take space nearly as seriously because 
is gonna be in a superposition of doing many different things therefore we should take the hints from black 
entropy as foundational as central here and in that case we should be dealing with finite numbers of degrees 
freedom in quantum gravity finitedimensional hilbert sc we know which road to take in this fork in the road 
direction to go in going to choose to go down the road that says only a finite number of 
of freedom in every region of space okay that quantum field theory is not the final story that something 
than quantum field theory and in some sense simpler right a finite number of degrees of freedom is simpler 
an infinite number of degrees of freedom so maybe a good thing there are problems that come up talk 
what some of those problems are how you map onto the successes in experiments of quantum field theory if 
only have a finite number of degrees of freedom to play with but there we go that is the 
going to make so where does that leave us where are we we imagine that the universe is described 
a wave function at least the observable universe is described by a wave function in a finitedimensional hilbert space 
we want to take advantage of the idea that locality determines how the laws of physics work that is 
say space locations in space are the things with respect to which interactions between different parts of the universe 
local okay sc i think i probably messed that one up space is the thing with respect to which 
look local so that might just seem like a happy motto to put forward but very difficult to deal 
in practice and it is hard so the task before us is to go from this abstract quantum wave 
and find the universe within it find the universe that we know and love this is not a task 
has been getting a lot of attention in the history of physics right like i said before no matter 
good you are at quantum mechanics the traditional thing to do has always been to start with a classical 
and to quantize it this whole project of starting with a true quantum mechanical description and seeing how the 
world emerges has simply not been the focus of research for generations now sc so we are finally beginning 
take this question seriously so baby steps right at the beginning of something that is very exciting but not 
fully developed by any stretch so a little bit of progress was made just a couple of years ago 
a group of students at stanford university cutler et al gonna forget all their names sorry about that so 
said the following thing imagine you really did have the most abstract description of a quantum system you could 
so not the quantum system of particles moving in space or of springs or of spins or anything like 
not the quantum mechanical description of anything just a quantum theory all by itself you have wave functions and 
have equation the schrodinger equation says how the wave function evolves with sc and they asked the question given 
that information could you reverse engineer could you go backwards could you figure out what this was a quantum 
description of could you figure out sort of the precursor classicallooking theory that had you quantized it would have 
you this quantum mechanical description and in particular they focused in on the question of locality so you have 
wave function as i said wave functions are typically even if finitedimensional the number of dimensions is very very 
so you can divide it up you can choose to consider this wave function to be the combination of 
many little subsystems interacting with each other and becoming entangled and what locality means in this context is that 
different subsystems will interact with their neighbors but not interact with other things in fact if you even wanna 
it by using the word neighbors different subsystems will interact with only a small number of other systems in 
bigger wave function and those other subsystems will interact with just a small number of other subsystems etcetera sc 
is the way that locality can emerge rather than saying this little piece of the universe only interacts with 
neighbors you say this little piece of the universe only interacts with a small number of other pieces of 
universe which we will then call its neighbors what it means to be a neighbor rather than saying two 
interact when neighbors two things are neighbors when they interact and what cutler et al were able to show 
that for a given abstract quantum system usually no way of doing that at all usually no way of 
an abstract quantum system and dividing it into a bunch of little local subsystems just talking to their neighbors 
sometimes there are and when there are when there is that way is usually unique in other words not 
ways of dividing the big quantum wave function into many little local subsystems more or less one way and 
footnotes about what more or less means in that context but the point is and this is just really 
and exciting and crucial that you need to start with space and locality sc you can start with an 
quantum mechanical system ask yourself the question there any way of describing it so that it looks like a 
of things interacting locally in and the answer when the answer is a unique way more or less of 
it you can take away function and chop it up into local pieces okay how space in the sense 
things that are next to each other or far away etcetera can emerge from the quantum mechanical wave function 
now a good step i like i said is i think crucially important fascinating going to be the basis 
a lot of work going forward but just a very first tiny step these folks were not thinking about 
they were thinking about space but they were not thinking about the much richer set of things that happened 
universe einstein says not only there is space but space is part of spacetime and that spacetime is dynamical 
it moves around and it warps and it has geometry and that geometry gives us the force of gravity 
we know it so we wanna go from simply the notion of locality and interacting in space to the 
richer notion of a dynamical curved spacetime geometry how do we do that the answer you will not be 
again if been listening to my rants over the years is to be found in the notion of entropy 
no big surprise sc entropy is the answer to everything is the short motto for all of my discussions 
just about everything where does that come from what does entropy have to do with anything i breezed over 
idea that black holes have entropy and that that somehow tells us how many degrees of freedom there are 
a region but be a little bit more specific okay remember we said that entanglement between different parts of 
universe different subsystems of the universe is at the heart of quantum mechanics so forget about our ambitions for 
moment to talk about emergent spacetime and so forth go back to our quantum field theory way of thinking 
things or even better what we call regularize our quantum field theory which is to say take apart the 
number of things going on and imagine a lattice imagine literally some network of little quantum mechanical degrees of 
maybe electrons or something that are interacting with each other in some lattice structure okay and you let it 
down so you imagine that this system is in what we call its vacuum state its lowest energy state 
an amazing thing that is true you can take some subsystem some region of space so some degrees of 
inside and some outside going to be entangled with each other this is a generic feature of quantum field 
that degrees of freedom in any one location in space are entangled in the vacuum state with degrees of 
all over the place everywhere else in the universe they are highly entangled with other nearby degrees of freedom 
they are only a little tiny bit entangled with degrees of freedom far away but everything is a little 
entangled with everything else and you can go through the math okay you can say i have a region 
space so an inside an outside and a boundary between this region the region has a volume and the 
has an area okay how things work if space has three dimensions remember we are assuming space for the 
just to get some lessons to build on later down the line it turns out that the entanglement between 
the inside the boundary and outside the boundary gives rise to entropy sc the entanglement entropy of a system 
described by john von neumann early on in the days of quantum mechanics basically because you know if you 
of entropy as saying something i know something that the system describing is in a superposition or a combination 
many different possibilities even if you know the entire wave function of the universe if you only keep track 
going on on one side of a boundary the inside or the outside then for all intents and purposes 
know going on on the other side and you can describe you can assign that lack of perfect knowledge 
entropy so unlike classical systems where entropy really comes from some ignorance something you know in quantum mechanics a 
kind of entropy an entropy that just arises from entanglement the von neumann entropy or the entanglement entropy okay 
and furthermore you can calculate what it looks like and in the system that describing where a region of 
with an inside and an outside it turns out that that entropy of the region inside is proportional to 
area of the boundary which makes perfect sense right because if there are degrees of freedom that are deep 
the interior of the region mostly unentangled i should say entangled but only a little bit with degrees of 
very far away most of the entanglement is between nearby degrees of freedom which means most of the entanglement 
happening just across the boundary and therefore the bigger the area of the boundary the more entanglement gonna be 
the more entropy going to be so this is a very general feature that has nothing to do with 
yet this is just a feature of quantum field theories or theories on lattices that you could then take 
limit as the lattice gets very very close together to make a quantum field theory regions of space have 
entropy that entropy is proportional to the area at least when the system as a whole is in its 
state in its lowest energy state sc a crucial footnote actually because i could invent different states in which 
entropy was much higher because i said different parts of the system are entangled with each other with their 
neighbors mostly and only a little bit with things further away i could invent a different state where things 
my region are highly entangled with things far away so if i have gravity if i just had a 
spacetime and i took a region of it the maximum entropy i could put in that region is not 
to the area of the boundary proportional to the volume of the region because how many degrees of freedom 
inside sort of one per every little part in space one per every cubic planck length or whatever it 
okay so without gravity the maximum entropy in a region goes like the volume of the region but the 
entropy when the whole system is in its vacuum state goes as the area sc now in ted jacobson 
is an ingenious theoretical physicist at the university of maryland made a bold suggestion he said what if you 
that kind of discussion take a region of space calculate its entropy but you turn on gravity you say 
gravity is and of course we know how gravity works einstein gave us an equation okay equation tells us 
spacetime responds to matter and energy what jacobson and this is how theoretical physics works you make up an 
you make a suggestion see where it goes he said maybe something special about gravity which makes it work 
the following thing in the nongravitational context the entropy of the vacuum state is proportional to the area but 
principle it could be much higher what if in gravity the entropy of a region is always proportional to 
area of its boundary in other words i could imagine trying to increase the entropy of a region by 
the entanglement of things inside with things outside but jacobson suggests what that amounts to is also increasing the 
of energy inside the region sc and we know from general relativity that if you have energy in a 
the geometry of space is going to change and that includes the area of the boundary so jacobson says 
look maybe in general relativity or at least in a theory with gravity there is a feature a new 
of nature that says that the area of every region is proportional to the entropy of the region inside 
even if you try to excite or change a system in a certain region of space spacetime has a 
that adjusts to make sure that the area of the surrounding boundary is always proportional to the entropy inside 
a suggestion you can imagine something like that but what jacobson showed is that if you take that suggestion 
face value you can derive an equation relating the entropy to the geometry and then you could derive another 
relating the entropy to the energy and by doing that you get an equation relating the geometry to the 
which is exactly what you have in general relativity sc and in fact jacobson argued it is exactly equation 
general relativity so einstein in some sense simply assumed his equation he proposed it he said if the geometry 
spacetime is related to energy and matter in a certain what jacobson says is if the geometry of spacetime 
related to entropy in a certain and he claims that he can then derive equation from that new assumption 
is a program called thermodynamic gravity or entropic gravity erik verlinde and others have worked on later versions of 
gravity basically imagining that even if we know going on in quantum gravity there are some degrees of freedom 
the universe that interact with each other in some particular ways and from the properties of entanglement and entropy 
those degrees of freedom we can derive the geometry of spacetime and the natural thing for that geometry to 
is to obey equation this is just a wonderful idea very creative and very novel and has very farreaching 
consequences even though it was so over twenty years now pushing twentyfive years my goodness still something that physicists 
not quite yet come to terms with sc thinking about it trying to get our brains around it this 
idea that from entropy and area we can derive all of gravity okay now jacobson of course doing quantum 
you might think he was talking about quantum mechanics and talking about gravity but he assumed that there was 
spacetime that basically a classical spacetime and that spacetime was responding to quantum mechanical matter living within it so 
is what is called semiclassical quantum gravity not true quantum gravity in true quantum gravity spacetime itself should be 
but in theory spacetime was classical and matter was quantum so what we would like to do the ambition 
is to derive spacetime itself from something purely quantum mechanical and we now know from cutler et al that 
could imagine that the idea of space itself could emerge from the quantum mechanical wave function sc so what 
we basically took these two sets of ideas locality and position emerging from the wave function and the geometry 
spacetime being driven by the entropy of different degrees of freedom and combined them this is essentially what was 
in a couple of papers that written with charles cao and spiros michalakis charles and spiros and i wrote 
paper and then charles and i followed up spiros his name you might know like me he has not 
is he a mathematical physicist but also served as a consultant on movies he was in particular a consultant 
antman and fault that something called the quantum realm that plays such an important role in the marvel universe 
got antman to start talking about the quantum realm and it was all over once that happened okay but 
not palling around with hollywood celebrities a physicist and charles was a graduate student who is now a postdoc 
the university of maryland sc and we put together this idea of spacetime emerging from hilbert space so in 
we really talk about time that much to be perfectly honest but the geometry of space emerging from an 
quantum mechanical description so basically what we said is again if you think about how things work in the 
cases where we understand going on in the vacuum state of a quantum field theory you have this idea 
two degrees of freedom that are nearby will be highly entangled two degrees of freedom that are far away 
be less entangled cutler et al showed that you can use that kind of thing and turn it around 
can define what you mean to be a nearest neighbor by having a lot of interaction what charles and 
and i suggested is you can extend that what you can say is you can define the distance between 
parts of the universe between two parts of the wave function of the universe to be inversely proportional to 
amount of entanglement so if two degrees of freedom are highly entangled they are nearby if not very entangled 
are further away sc in the followup paper that charles and i wrote we did this much more respectably 
a much more respectable mathematical way really looking at areas that you can define in this emergent spacetime and 
them to entropies basically math here you can read our papers i encourage you to do that but the 
is we asked if you let not just a notion of locality emerge from the quantum wave function but 
fullblown geometry of space let that emerge from the wave function a natural way to define it and then 
could follow logic and you can say are the equations that should be obeyed by this and guess what 
find equation you find the same equation relating geometry to matter that albert einstein proposed back in sc now 
need to immediately jump in here and point out that i wanna overclaim because it sounds amazing and it 
amazing but amazing with a lot of footnotes okay we made a lot of assumptions and the biggest assumption 
we only worked in the weak field limit of distortions of the geometry of space so a mild not 
noticeable gravitational field not like a black hole or the big bang or something like that okay so we 
that under certain very explicitly delineated assumptions in the situation where gravity was weak the relationship between entropy and 
that defines geometry naturally led to equation in a purely emergent spacetime so unlike jacobson who started with spacetime 
then got equation we start with a quantum wave function and we say that the natural geometry to be 
on the space that naturally emerges from the quantum wave function naturally obeys the equations of gravity as we 
and love them sc this i think as exciting as it sounds i think very very interesting because nowhere 
nowhere in that description did i use words like or quantum or or any of those things all of 
ideas which may very well be important and relevant to the final answer but all of them start from 
classical description of the world and then quantize them okay that is what everyone has done at every other 
to quantize gravity in the history of quantizing gravity we are really doing something different by trying to start 
the abstract wave function and rather than quantizing gravity we are finding gravity within quantum mechanics even if our 
understanding of how to do that is very primitive and limited i think that the prospect for doing that 
extremely exciting sc now one of the reasons why limited is because in fact not just we done it 
but the thing that done cannot possibly be the entire story and i think that our papers have been 
and people have cited them but not lit the world on fire and i think i know why i 
know why a couple of reasons why but the big one is one of the things we do think 
learned about quantum gravity over the past twenty years is that locality is not fundamental everything that i said 
the past whatever it is twenty minutes about finding the emergent spacetime geometry within the wave function of the 
is based on this idea of locality based on this idea that you can define a position in space 
the fact that degrees of freedom can only interact when at the same position or at least right next 
each other in the space and that seems to be an absolutely crucial part of quantum field theory but 
of quantum gravity sc so in the weak field limit theory of general relativity looks very much like an 
classical field theory but when things become strong such as when you have a black hole the locality that 
know and love from field theory seems to break down seems to be somehow avoided in certain very very 
ways and this is not something we understand very well and it might even go away but i think 
i think on the right track sc so the basic idea involves words like and so let me just 
you the very very briefest introduction to what those words mean in this context we said that a black 
has an entropy and the entropy is proportional to its area okay so back when people first started thinking 
this they were surprised by that if instead of a black hole if you have a box of gas 
box of gas has an entropy that is proportional to the volume of the box of gas if you 
the volume while keeping the density of gas inside the same the entropy goes up with the volume going 
so they were confused as to why the entropy of a black hole went as its area now with 
story just told you with entanglement and degrees of freedom and nearby locality etcetera it is less surprising to 
that the entropy of a black hole goes as the area of its event horizon but they were surprised 
then okay sc so we thought a lot about how to make sense of this idea that somehow a 
hole was a maximum entropy state and yet its entropy only went as its area not as its volume 
and it was suggested by lenny susskind among others gerard hooft was one of the other ones that there 
something holographic going on in the following sense that you think that the interior of a black hole is 
forget about extra dimensions of space or anything like that a black hole is a twodimensional event horizon around 
threedimensional interior and so the theory the sort of physical description of happening inside the black hole you might 
describes different objects different things that fall into the black hole bumping into each other in this threedimensional space 
but the holographic principle says another way of thinking about the black hole which just sort of puts everything 
the boundary imagines that what is really happening inside the black hole can be entirely described simply by giving 
that is located at the twodimensional boundary of the black hole in other words rather than thinking of the 
hole as a set of degrees of freedom scattered throughout the three dimensional volume inside you should think about 
black hole as a set of degrees of freedom scattered across the twodimensional horizon the boundary between the inside 
the outside the idea of holography and maybe the idea goes this extends far beyond black holes maybe all 
reality that we think of as threedimensional is somehow encoded in some twodimensional thing we know where that thing 
be or what kind of surface it would be but it would be like a hologram a twodimensional hologram 
you shine a light on it gives you a threedimensionallooking image sc maybe the holographic principle suggests the whole 
world around us is just a reflection of or an emergent phenomenon from some underlying twodimensional description still a 
we know about holography there is one context in which extremely wellunderstood which is the antide sitter spaceconformal field 
correspondence the adscft correspondence i really wanna go into the details about that right now i did talk a 
about it with susskind on our mindscape conversation but basically a model for quantum gravity where you have an 
boundary where a theory without gravity and an interior with an dimensional spacetime so a duality a relationship between 
ndimensional spacetime without gravity and an dimensional spacetime with gravity sc holography in action just no question this is 
very vivid calculable useful laboratory for exploring the ideas of holography the problem is and rather than extolling the 
of the adscft correspondence gonna go right into the problem with it it is not the real world this 
that has gravity in it in the adscft context is a spacetime with a negative vacuum energy a negative 
constant why it is called antide sitter space de sitter who was a collaborator of einstein was the one 
first really sat down and thought about the cosmological ramifications of a positive vacuum energy a positive cosmological constant 
he found a solution to the equations that were given by einstein which we now call de sitter space 
you have a negative cosmological constant you get antide sitter space and people figured that out sc the problem 
antide sitter space uses a negative cosmological constant the context in which we best understand holography but the real 
seems to have a positive cosmological constant we discovered in one thousand nine hundred ninetyeight that the universe is 
expanding faster and faster that corresponds to a positive value of the vacuum energy so even though antide sitter 
is crucially important as a worked example of holography in action not the real world and i do i 
feel like maybe i say this very hesitatingly but i do feel like maybe spending too much time as 
field investigating and exploring the implications of antide sitter space sc you know the old joke i say this 
the book the old joke about looking for your keys under a lamp post right you meet a drunk 
lost his keys looking for his keys and at some point helping him and you see the keys anywhere 
you say you sure you lost your keys and the drunk guy says no i lost them over there 
the light is much better here under the lamp so antide sitter space is a really bright lamp post 
it comes to holography and quantum gravity but not where we lost our keys not the world we live 
so what doing with charles and spiros and i and other people are doing is trying something that is 
than antide sitter space in some sense less welldefined but at least the real world we are not taking 
of the negative cosmological constant the adscft relies on so heavily sc anyway that was one thing holography the 
thing so sorry to complete the thought adscft is evidence that locality be purely fundamental you have two different 
of the world with different numbers of dimensions of space i mean how different could that be something that 
local in one description on the boundary say is widely nonlocal in the other description and viceversa but both 
good so one locality is another nonlocality this is a reflection of the fact that locality be quite as 
and fundamental in quantum gravity as it was in quantum field theory sc complementarity is an idea that takes 
one step further complementarity arises from the idea that we want to allow black holes to evaporate to give 
hawking radiation and disappear without destroying the quantum information that falls into them this is the black hole information 
problem another thing that i wanna get into right now in the book i talk about it with susskind 
i think that little bit with penrose but hard to get the information out of black holes you throw 
book into a black hole it falls into the singularity if you want to allow that information to be 
somehow the information in the book needs to escape in the outgoing radiation and there are very good arguments 
that simply cannot happen if locality is respected if the book has a location in space you can follow 
gonna hit the singularity its information is not going to escape into the radiation sc so susskind again and 
suggested this idea of horizon or black hole complementarity complementarity was used in this context first by niels bohr 
in the pioneering days of quantum mechanics and complementarity refers to the idea two different ways of looking at 
and neither one of them is right or wrong both true but they both be true at the same 
so what bohr would say is something can have a position or it could have a velocity but it 
both at the same time something could be a particle or it could be a wave but it be 
at the same time sc what susskind wants to say is that going on in the black hole could 
described by ordinary local quantum field theory inside the black hole or it can be described by a set 
degrees of freedom scattered across the boundary the event horizon of the black hole but not both at the 
time in particular if you fall into the black hole you notice anything when you fall across the event 
everything looks normal and ordinary and three dimensional to you but according to complementarity from the point of view 
an outside observer not what they see in fact they never even see you cross the event horizon they 
you just get red shifted and move more and more slowly and what susskind says is what they see 
your quantum information becomes spread around the event horizon you get sort of smeared onto this twodimensional surface so 
look like local threedimensional quantum field theory to the infalling observer but it looks like a twodimensional membrane just 
the black hole from the point of view of someone outside the black hole that is what is called 
complementarity sc now again even compared to adseft we have much less understanding of how to make this evocative 
into something specific and rigorous and quantitative people have done work on it made progress etcetera but still a 
handwavy a little vague but the lesson seems to be clear if you buy any of these arguments at 
and again not everyone does i do i tend to believe they are on the right track if you 
these lessons from black hole physics what they seem to be teaching us is that the idea of describing 
as a set of degrees of freedom with definite locations in space is not the final answer not the 
once and for all way of thinking about the emergence of the universe from a quantum mechanical wave function 
this is big news if true right this says that where you are in space is not a fundamental 
in the best theory that we have of reality okay a little bit hard to wrap our minds around 
this is why still struggling with it but that seems to be the implication sc the stuff that charles 
spiros and i and others have done to think about the emergence of spacetime and the emergence of gravity 
assumes that you can describe the emergent spacetime using locality using locations in space as a fundamental building block 
it only works in the weak field limit of gravity when gravity is not that strong a black hole 
exactly where gravity is very strong so no inconsistency with what done and what we want to do what 
want to do is extend our philosophy of starting purely with quantum mechanics and deriving the emergence of a 
spacetime from nothing other than the entanglement properties and the intrinsic quantum properties of the system and we want 
be able to do that not only when gravity is weak but also when gravity is strong sc no 
to doing this in principle this is one of the wonderful things about quantum mechanics the different ways of 
a quantum system can get you different looking answers right so the idea that a system might look threedimensional 
you look at it in one way and look twodimensional if you look at it in another way this 
very natural from a quantum mechanical point of view it takes the idea that we observe something very seriously 
puts it front and center this is a perfect system to think about in terms of everettian quantum mechanics 
the emergence of spacetime from something more fundamental there might be more than one way to chop up spacetime 
make it look local depending on how doing your observations sc so the frontier what working on right now 
try to take this idea of emergent spacetime from entanglement the geometry of space as something that is defined 
post facto from how different degrees of freedom are interacting with each other and extend it away from weak 
to the whole universe to include the big bang black holes etcetera there are a large number of challenges 
right this is not built on firm ground this is built on a chain of speculations and guesses and 
could blow up at any time life in the fast lane theoretical physicswise but see where it goes let 
just mention the most obvious failure mode for this whole picture which comes back to this idea that there 
only a finite number of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom in any one region of space in every region 
space for that matter sc again i said that that idea only a finite number of degrees of freedom 
in conflict with what we would expect from quantum field theory in quantum field theory always an infinite number 
degrees of freedom in every region of space and quantum field theory just a guess quantum field theory is 
some sense the natural maybe even arguably the unique way to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity right special 
came ten years before general relativity special relativity says that spacetime but all just one thing okay and he 
special relativity einstein does not let spacetime be curved spacetime but flat sc special relativity is the theory where 
say you go faster than the speed of light and also it says that no such thing as an 
velocity through space right a relative velocity of two different objects but no such thing as your absolute frame 
reference frame of reference is equally good and if true if those basic features are true you can kind 
see why you need an infinite number of degrees of freedom a little bit of a leap but you 
get there because imagine that you say well i imagine a quantum mechanical theory where a fundamental distance of 
right a shortest distance past which nothing can exist a minimum distance between any two points in space sc 
according to special relativity the actual size of that minimal distance will look different to different observers moving at 
speeds with respect to each other right lorentz invariance is this idea that distances change and times change as 
move at different velocities and they exactly cancel out so that the speed of light is the same to 
and so if one long distance is another short distance the only way to make that completely compatible is 
distances can be infinitely short because speeds can be infinitely close to the speed of light without quite getting 
so there seems to be an incompatibility between the basic fundamental ideas of special relativity and the simple idea 
there are only a finite number of degrees of freedom in any one region of space sc that was 
handwavy way of saying something much more specific and rigorous and mathematical but the same ultimate upshot which is 
if you have a finite number of degrees of freedom very hard for special relativity to be exactly true 
special relativity is very important to us right very foundational for everything that we do in physics so you 
think well this is just a killer this says that your ideas are on the wrong track however an 
spin you can put on this you can say well like anything else no matter how charmed we might 
by a certain idea in physics the amount that we accept that idea should only be proportional to the 
we have for it and that should never be maybe special relativity is just a really good approximation but 
exactly true maybe lorentz invariance is approximately a feature of nature but not a precise feature of nature sc 
that implies is a possibility of future experimental tests because lorentz invariance is something that has been very precisely 
in experiments both in laboratories and using astrophysical data so absolutely possible if gonna take this lemon and make 
lemonade out of it to say that maybe a feature of this particular approach to quantum gravity is that 
invariance is not exact and that will be observed in some future experimental test a huge problem with quantum 
in that gravity itself is extremely extremely weak and therefore it is very difficult or may be impossible to 
an experiment that we could conceivably do in the near term which would manifest both quantum mechanical properties and 
properties at the same time very difficult to get direct experimental constraints on quantum gravity but maybe we can 
indirect constraints sc if you say a feature of gravity is that it means only a finite number of 
of freedom and a feature of finite numbers of degrees of freedom is that lorentz invariance is only approximate 
that opens up an experimental window and maybe experimental quantum gravity will be one of the frontiers in the 
furthermore there are implications of this not just experimentally but conceptually for hard questions like did the universe come 
happen at the big we know there are different people including myself who have different ideas but let me 
put out one idea that follows from this emergent spacetime picture always been a problem a puzzle a sort 
mild discomfort in the way that we think about cosmology if you think about it in terms of quantum 
theory sc in quantum field theory you have fields filling all of space and these fields vibrate and you 
that there are modes of the field which is just a fancy way of saying vibrations of a certain 
and as the universe expands those modes expand along with it so like a photon in the cosmic microwave 
gets stretched by the expansion of space it goes from a short wavelength to a long wavelength in the 
frame of the universe but weird because you need to imagine there are an infinite number of such modes 
each of them starts infinitesimally tiny and then gets stretched to microscopic sizes as the universe expands so everything 
you see around you right now if you took its wavelength and shrunk it down to when the universe 
it would be shorter than the planck length this hypothetical length at which quantum gravity becomes very very important 
so it sounds as if somehow new degrees of freedom are coming into existence as the universe expands it 
degrees of freedom from below the planck length to above the planck length that just sounds weird not in 
conflict with anything but it kind of makes us uncomfortable okay this picture of a finitedimensional number of degrees 
freedom changes that and gives us a new way of thinking about it the new way says look what 
is is a number of entangled degrees of freedom entangled in such a way as to define this emergent 
spacetime geometry so maybe what we mean by the expansion of the universe is not new degrees of freedom 
into existence maybe the degrees of freedom were always there in some finite number of degrees of freedom but 
happens is that they were initially unentangled with the universe sc if you have a degree of freedom that 
unentangled with everything else then for all intents and purposes not part of spacetime and in this picture as 
expands what that means is that the degrees of freedom that were originally unentangled with everything become entangled join 
spacetime continuum and become part of the geometry of spacetime all around us in fact i wrote a fun 
paper with some collaborators called circuit you might know that now that we do quantum computers a whole burgeoning 
in quantum circuits just like regular computers have circuit diagrams you write down an algorithm in terms of and 
and not gates and so forth you can do all that with quantum computers sc and a very natural 
of thinking about the evolution of a quantum system if that quantum system is number one finitedimensional and number 
has some notion of locality built into it so that one part of the system interact with everything else 
just interacts with some nearest neighbors we are saying that the universe is exactly like that and therefore you 
think of the whole universe as a quantum circuit and the evolution of the universe through time is the 
of all sorts of generalized versions of and gates and not gates and so forth is that a useful 
of looking at the universe i really know have to find out this is again very very early days 
i think an exciting prospect to truly change the way that we think about cosmology at a fundamental level 
so the lesson of all of you know on the one hand we have some specific suggestions for how 
gravity works and how spacetime emerges from the wave function but also i think an even deeper lesson which 
the need to take the foundations of quantum mechanics seriously when you think about hard questions in ordinary physics 
know as we talked about with adam becker a remarkable feature of century physics that quantum mechanics was at 
center of it and yet ever since roughly physicists had this agreement mostly unwritten agreement but sometimes written down 
to not pay attention to the measurement problem and the questions of the foundations of quantum mechanics sc i 
do think that this choice been made by the physics community as a whole has held us back enormously 
looking at questions that are as hard and as fundamental as quantum gravity and the emergence of spacetime in 
interesting to think that hugh everett when he invented the manyworlds interpretation was inspired by the problem of quantum 
so this is back in the they already knew general relativity they could try to quantize gravity and technical 
that immediately arose but also these conceptual problems and one of them was if you only had at your 
the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics then an important crucial part of quantum mechanics is that there is an 
the observer measures the system and the wave function collapses and a crucial part of quantum mechanics and everett 
what if my system is the whole right then no observer observing it just evolving all by itself sc 
what led him to say we just have wave functions evolving all by themself we have collapses or anything 
that what do you and the answer was manyworlds so the beginning of manyworlds as a formulation of quantum 
was inspired by quantum gravity maybe quantum gravity will maybe i should maybe manyworlds will repay the favor maybe 
about quantum mechanics from the manyworlds perspective will help us solve quantum gravity after all if we know that 
difficult to find the right theory of quantum gravity and we agree that been very difficult to find the 
theory of quantum mechanics maybe we be surprised maybe we expect to get the right theory of quantum gravity 
we fully understand quantum mechanics i for one am ambitious optimistic willing to think that we are actually going 
do this if only because finally taking these foundational questions very very seriously see where it goes thanks for 
music wonderful podcast and fairly sure likely to be a wonderful book thank you is it possible to download 
transcript i download the audio by hitting the obvious hint but other than cut and paste i am unsure 
a quick step for the download which i love thanks this is an amazing solo podcast sean you are 
good at explaining what science is all about fantastic podcast is the new book going to be avaible via 
i certainly hope so nothing is showing on the amazonaudible uk site another pointofview httpswwwedgeorgconversationjulianbarbourtheuniverseisnotinabox wonderful podcast looking forward 
reading your book a big fan of your podcasts this afternoon i purchased a copy of your new book 
and am looking forward to a better understanding of the ideas you are presenting i must admit however that 
does seem preposterous that there may be untold numbers of me out there in different universes that i create 
time i make a decision is their history also my history and is their future also my future if 
then each of them is also creating new universes and new copies of me every time they make a 
what do i not understand about my decisions creating duplicates of me in other universes these podcasts are amazing 
can you post a link to the cutler et al paper not being familiar with your field i can 
determine which paper is the exact one you are referencing very interesting i have a difficulty with the idea 
spacetime emerging from neighbouring elements of the hilbert space the hilbert space a space of wave functions if so 
what are the wave functions functions of their domain spacetime the episode transcript prints in quantum field theory you 
fields filling all of space and these fields vibrate and you imagine that there are modes of the field 
we strike off the s on fields the two times it occurs hi sean could you please comment on 
issue with manyworld approach every second the universe branches into five thousand universes as you mentioned in one of 
podcast and each of those five thousand universes branches into five thousand more after one more second now consider 
eighty year old person he has lived close to seconds which is billion seconds so in his life time 
has branched times which is unfathomably and uncomprehensibly large number so close to his death he has that many 
of him in different worlds now if you choose randomly a existence heshe find himself to be in the 
where almost infinite copies of him exist which is close to his death so everyone person should find himselfherself 
to hisher death with almost a probability one infinity we clearly see that is not the case looking forward 
your comment on what is wrong with this argument thanks sajid terrific discussion while degrees of freedom make my 
spin i think i grokked what you are trying to do the book is in my possession and read 
on vacation thanx i am just grasping the beginnings of understanding the connection between qm and the emergence of 
nad other things my question is classically i associate space and time with measurement so we need some fabric 
stitch coordinates and measure events on the other side before the emergence of spacetime you have a state wave 
that somehow i understand they use no matter if it is on hilbert space some kind of coordinate system 
to that apparently is not spacetime becasue it emerged yet am i in a wrong interpretation or is some 
of paradox thank you brilliant podcast sajid well for one thing you randomly choose a random person from a 
point in time from a random universe so an experiment that be done for another thing when the universe 
it literally create more universe remember the schrodinger equation is timereversible if you run it back in time every 
has a past but those pasts become identical as we approach the big bang so if you fill a 
bucket with sand and then empty the giant bucket into two big buckets and then empty each big bucket 
two medium buckets and then empty each medium bucket into two small buckets then choose a random grain of 
you have eight times as much sand to choose from in the small buckets than you did in the 
bucket ps no physicist but confident that the gist of what said is right axel krüger thanks for that 
current link the point with the box because thermodynamics was developped in the context of the steam engine and 
reminded me of bob doyle who also emphasises the importance of inflation for resolving certain quantum puzzles not that 
would understand that part i mostly read his stuff because he is historically very accurate like most philosophers and 
to the typical habit of physicists to history to better fit the story they want to tell and provides 
original reference documents i wondered whether he is still alive since the last entry on his blog is from 
and was delighted to find out that he has published a new book in march two thousand nineteen httpwwwinformationphilosophercombookseinstein 
the podcast as always are the concepts of dimensionality of hilbert space and the number of degrees of freedom 
the wavefunction related this podcast made me wonder if the nonlocality of entanglement is the same nonlocality as in 
holographic principle so that the entanglement of two particles widely separated in space is the result of them remaining 
the holographic wondered for years whether entangled particles might be local in some other way of describing spacetime jim 
the wavefunction branch when you make a decision it branches when two quantum systems interact and decohere by becoming 
with the environment so there will be vast numbers of but they differ in their decisions no no regrets 
enjoyed the podcast i am currently reading your book the big and cant wait to read your latest book 
rider since our brains consist of atoms they are also quantum entities when i am walking and approach a 
i could choose to cross the street straight ahead or turn and cross the other intersecting street if i 
to turn there is another me in another universe that crosses straight ahead when the wave function collapses the 
is made both outcomes are realized sean am i an idiot or is this consistent with the many worlds 
have you read book by blake crouch maybe an idea for a future podcast about science and sciencefiction of 
really liked this solo episode wait to read your new book truly inspiring to see work done in the 
of quantum mechanics great work comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers science 
philosophy culture arts and ideas
