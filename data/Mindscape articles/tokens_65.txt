carroll and you might remember a couple of weeks ago we did a slight detour from our usual topics 
exactly sure what our usual topics are but we took a detour back into the ancient world we talked 
ed watts about the decline of the roman republic and of course one of the interesting things about ancient 
or history at all is its resonances with contemporary history so today gonna go back to the ancient world 
had a good time in that previous podcast i hope you did too so today gonna go back but 
a slightly different twist connecting it to our issues of technology and artificial intelligence in fact gonna be asking 
were robots and ai systems like years ago sc now you might be thinking to yourself any robots or 
intelligences back in ancient greece and and correct but that stop people from talking about them the mythology the 
the poems of ancient greece and rome were in some sense similar to the science fiction and fantasy of 
they allowed the authors to let their imaginations roam free and they would often stop at the point where 
were talking about constructed beings in the shape or manner of humans sc so guest is adrienne mayor a 
of ancient scientist and a classical folklorist at stanford very interesting at this because she not only reads the 
texts but also consults the archeological paleontological evidence so gonna talk about all the different appearances in greek mythology 
robotlike creatures and of course being that with greek mythology there was always a lesson there was always something 
wrong because somebody did something bad and what it reflects is the fact that the worries or the interesting 
that face you when you talk about humanlike machines were just as relevant years ago when there no such 
as they are now sc so at the very least fun and hopefully a little bit more than fun 
think about what was prefigured in ancient mythology about our current worries about artificial intelligence robots and how changing 
so i think this is a fun episode also touch a little bit at the end on a different 
that adrienne wrote previously about amazons amazons of course are mythological female warriors there was no society that was 
female warriors but she makes the case quite convincingly that there were female warriors historically on whom the amazon 
were based so yet another example of how things going on in the ancient world still have their reflections 
so i think this is a good mindexpanding episode even if a little bit off of our usual beaten 
so go music sc adrienne mayor welcome to the mindscape podcast adrienne mayor thank you for inviting me sc 
had plenty of people in the show a lot of scientists technologists etcetera but we have this special time 
gonna have with you because written a book about ancient ideas of technology robots cyborgs artificial intelligence but for 
most part correct me if wrong these are not actual stuff that people built these are mythological tales these 
completely madeup stories is that right am well i wondered whether it was possible that the concepts the ideas 
creating artificial life automatons robots even artificial intelligence i wondered if those ideas were thinkable before the technology made 
enterprises possible and i did find that remarkably if you look at mythology as early as the time of 
and now talking about seven hundred fifty to six hundred fifty bc the first writings in the ancient greek 
a group of ancient greek myths were envisioning how to imitate nature and make automatons by means of bio 
and a greek word that means life through craft that would be what we now call biotechnology and they 
them beings that were made not born am so in these myths and talking about myths popular very famous 
myths like jason and the argonauts stories about the sorceress medea and the bronze robot talos who guarded the 
of crete the legendary craftsman daedalus and prometheus who was known as the fire bringer and then pandora the 
female who was created by the god of technology and invention hephaestus and these were very vivid myths and 
think of them as sort of ancient thought experiments kind of set in an alternate world where technology was 
advanced because divine so the gods making these beings that are made not born made by bio techne but 
the last chapter of my book i do talk about the genuine selfmoving devices and automatons that were actually 
and made by real inventors and craftsmen beginning in the century bc so even that goes back much earlier 
people have recognized sc yeah i we wanna hear all these stories all these stories are fantastic but just 
set the stage a little bit maybe what would be the way that a person who lived in the 
bc thought about technology did they think of machines as a thing there was obviously simple machines levers and 
forth were being invented back in those days but these days in our lives technological advance is very important 
us is that a concept that they would have had am interesting what their technology and machines was used 
in the practical world amusing that they use them in their everyday life but they used them in warfare 
in the theatre so there are machines to raise curtains and to bring things onto the stage so that 
looks sort of magical and then there are torsion catapults and other siege machines that use technology but for 
life not so much unless you consider things like the bow and arrow and things like that as human 
machines in a way they sort of are but i think most people when they thought of technology they 
of people doing metalwork and things like that and the god hephaestus of course was a blacksmith god the 
god with a job if you think about it always described as sweating over his work and surrounded by 
tools and interesting is that when described in the in the myths or in the literature or depicted in 
vase paintings hephaestus is always shown working surrounded by his tools and he was thought of by ordinary people 
using the same tools the same materials the same methods that an ordinary craftsman would be using in his 
on earth but of course a god so that his productions are gonna just be marvelous and awesome sc 
i mean a very interesting point that they would have been used to the products of craftsmanship right am 
sc but the something that is like a machine in the more modern sense would have been limited to 
they went to the theater or when they went to war or something like that so they knew about 
but they household devices i guess we should say am generally true on the other hand they probably saw 
moving statues of gods in temples because we do have some descriptions of animated statues at a very early 
and that would be feasible either with or if a machine it means that no one there actually moving 
parts but you could use steam or levers springs weights things like that to cause a statue to blink 
eyes for instance or move its arm hold out its hands or cry or sweat or bleed things like 
they could make statues that were animated in that way and if you think about it almost an uncanny 
effect that goes all the way back to these times of homer sc yeah that been very spooky to 
a suddenly moving statue especially back in the days when the idea of machines was not commonplace am right 
uncanny valley effect was first identified i think in one thousand nine hundred seventy by masahiro mori the japanese 
and it describes that eerie sensation that we have when we encounter really hyperrealistic robots but found many examples 
odyssey and iliad of people who have that same eerie disquieting but sort of religious awe about hyperrealism of 
statues and paintings in antiquity and of course now we know that all of these statues not just the 
ones but even the bronze ones were painted realistically and they painted with these garish colors that you see 
the reconstructions now that they know what kind of paints they were and colors they mixed wax with with 
pigment so that it had a warm look so that it looked real sc oh i see i was 
the impression from these reconstructions that seen that they were fairly cartoonish in some way but saying we were 
lot more realistic than that am they were much more realistic the recreations are just taking the most strict 
of the pigment that they have found but we know that they were very realisticlooking and they even had 
eyelashes and eyes and pupils and inlaid fingernails these were realistic statues if you think about seeing these in 
temple lifesize painted realistically in a realistic pose and if you go there at night no light except from 
oil lamp or perhaps the moon so you would have that uncanny valley effect sc yeah so the audience 
the audience for these stories would be familiar with the ideas of artificial creatures artificial human beings very telling 
course that as soon as we imagine making artificial machines we immediately imagine making artificial people of course what 
do am right chuckle sc and so they start telling stories about them my idea was just to start 
the story of talos because clearly one of the stars of your book and it made me go back 
watch some youtube clips from the famous jason and the argonauts movie from the am i love that movie 
in fact the first image in my book is an image of the the great bronze robot from that 
because someone made a bronze cast of the original model and it shows him crumbling and jason and the 
is really a cult film though it was i think but based on ancient epic poem called the argonautica 
jason and the argonauts some scholars think might be as old or even older than homer so we have 
story of a great bronze robot created by hephaestus the god of technology talos was a huge you could 
giant android made of bronze he was charged with defending crete against invaders and he patrolled king kingdom of 
by marching around the island three times a day someone has calculated that he would have to travel about 
hundred fifty miles an hour to accomplish this feat sc yeah well he was a big guy am yeah 
talking about ancient science fictions here right and so yeah and talos was kind of programmed by hephaestus to 
invaders he had several capabilities he could pick up large rocks and throw them at intruders he hurled boulders 
sink any foreign ships that he saw approaching crete shores and in close combat he could heat his bronze 
to red hot and then grab up a victim and hug them to his chest to roast them alive 
he does act like a robot he fits the definition of a robot in that he can carry out 
activities but even more remarkably we know about his inner workings and this is the this is the first 
of a robot in greek literature and we know the details of his inner workings apparently he was built 
an internal artery or vein some sort of conduit that went from his head to his feet and we 
know his power source his power source was ichor and ichor of course is a mysterious life fluid of 
gods what makes them immortal so got ichor pulsing through this single vein from his neck to his ankle 
this bronze you could call it a biomimetic vivisystem because it is actually described as an artery using a 
term the biological term for a vein or artery and yet made of bronze and the whole system is 
by a bronze bolt on his ankle and so this is a mythological product sc sorry just yeah no 
but just to put ourselves in the mood here i guess people at that time realize that even for 
organisms blood circulated it went around and around it came and went rather than just going in one direction 
quite figured out if putting my history of biology correctly is that right am right but really interesting is 
i think i cited a study in my book that shows that people still have that kind of vision 
electricity or the body but especially like electricity we know that it takes two wires to transmit and conduct 
sc like a circuit yeah am and yet people still think of it as a single pulsating fluid or 
so interesting that we still sort of have that sort of primitive view sc so the who is the 
of the argonautica am the argonautica was a set of oral legends and myths and tales or stories before 
was ever written down the first time it was written down in its entirety in a surviving form was 
apollonius of rhodes a poet from the century but he was writing down what were very old oral traditions 
but it does seem like whoever invented this story puts a little bit of brainwork into figuring out how 
would work kind of impressive that it just magic it really was a machine am yes and one of 
distinctions that i wanna make clear when we talk about these automatons and robots is that they are imagined 
products of technology if you think of metal metalworking and the way made of bronze and has inner workings 
brought to life by magic every culture has these stories including greece but every ancient culture has stories of 
matter magically brought to life by some sort of spell or maybe a command you think of adam and 
or even pygmalion and his ivory statue she was not made as an automaton or a technological being she 
magically brought to life by the goddess of love so what interested in is how these mythological stories actually 
technological products synthetic androids and artificial men and women and animals sc yeah is it fair to imagine that 
categories here sort of living organic beings there are magically created creatures and then technologically created creatures am yes 
think a pretty good distinction the fact that they describe talos and pandora and other of these artificial entities 
made not born i think a really important distinction because it really draws the line between as you say 
nonhuman artificial and natural and i think that really emphasizing the manufactured nature of talos and then pandora sc 
sure that the boundary lines here are a little fuzzy they exactly know what technology could do so a 
bit of magical thinking going into it but also there seemed to be a little bit of ambiguity about 
human some of these machines were i know in the ray harryhausen movie it seemed like talos maybe has 
or at least has some he feels bad when being defeated is that fair to say am right in 
original myth of talos which was actually the first written description of talos comes from hesiod the poet hesiod 
lived around the same time as homer so talos was first described in about seven hundred bc and he 
described as a kind of i guess you could say cyborg because he is sort of half human half 
and that line is as you say blurry and never really resolved whether he is all machine a sort 
soulless machine or whether the has a kind of consciousness or emotions and yeah the way destroyed we can 
about that too that sort of brings that all into question too sc well definitely one of the ways 
of the many ways in which the stories you recall in your book prefigure debates having right now right 
is the dividing line between an artificial intelligence or a conscious creature like an organic being and they maybe 
know i should ask you rather than just guessing did they ever wonder about that was there any ancient 
about at what point would an artificial being count as human am well i think the story of talos 
brings that to the forefront in the way he was finally destroyed he was destroyed because jason and the 
were lucky enough to have medea who was kind of a technowizard she had fallen in love with jason 
she was along with them and the one who figured out how to neutralize talos otherwise jason and the 
would have been killed by this killer robot medea figures okay she knew his inner workings and she knew 
he was powered by ichor and that ichor bestows immortality on the gods but she figured out the whole 
depends on that bolt on his ankle and if i can get him to allow me to remove that 
then this immortal ichor the power fluid will bleed out and he will be destroyed and so she plays 
his emotions she persuades him she tells talos that she can make him immortal am and of course a 
of human desire it he wants to become invulnerable he wants to go on forever and she says can 
you immortal but only if you allow me to remove that bolt on your and he agrees to that 
stepping out of the role of a pure machine making a decision that his makers and the people who 
him they expecting him to be able to have this kind of agency this kind of desire and this 
of human ability to make a bad decision sc it seems like bad programming honestly all he was supposed 
do was run around crete and throw boulders he supposed to be thinking about immortality am yeah right but 
persuaded him and she she and jason remove the bolt and we know that this is a very ancient 
of the story because we have face paintings from the century bc that actually show jason kneeling by this 
bronze man and using a tool to remove the bolt on the bronze ankle and talos is swooning falling 
reeling off balance and you can see that made of bronze painted like ancient artist painted statues or bronze 
and yet very humanized his eyes are rolling up and one artist actually painted a teardrop falling from his 
so they really did humanize him even though they thought of him as made of bronze so got all 
questions that seem so modern to us are kind of embedded in this story sc well one of the 
that it seems absolutely characteristic to me of greek stories and not an expert so again fill me in 
people trying to do things and then getting their comeuppance one way or the other being hubristic trying to 
or achieve immortality and then paying some sort of terrible price so i love the fact that even the 
even talos the robot still has this kind of human failing am right yes medea is kind of like 
hacker she figures out his point of weakness the vulnerability and she exploits it and i think an interesting 
modern lesson for us too a product or technology but taken down by technology sc yeah it was a 
solution to a technological problem it was very clever am exactly everyone should have medea on their side if 
be facing things like this sc well from reading your book i definitely get the feeling that medea deserves 
credit than she gets in the popular imagination i think of the play the euripides play and killing her 
and is a tragedy and things like that but she clearly was over and over again saving jason from 
things in the journey to the golden fleece am right and as i like to call her a kind 
technowizard because she is a sorceress she has all this arcane knowledge of drugs and biotechnology and she could 
people in her famous special golden cauldron by boiling powerful herbs and other drugs one story that she was 
by jason to restore his elderly youth and all cultures have these stories of the fountain of youth or 
stories but the greek story about medea doing this really has a lot of biotechnological details in it somehow 
drew all the blood out of the old veins and then replaced his blood with a sort of secret 
of plants and other ingredients that she brewed in her golden cauldron really really quite amazing sc i think 
on that in silicon valley right now they am exactly yes they really are this they are not just 
about rejuvenation and extending human lifespan but trying to think about immortality too historians of surgery have pointed out 
sort of imaginary experiment this is a myth of course that it kind of foreshadows modern blood transfusions i 
she withdrew all of his blood and replaced it so sort of a prefiguring of what is called exchange 
substitution transfusion where a blood is completely bled out and then replaced with a blood and in the past 
think fifteen years some blood exchange experiments have been carried out with young and old mice and been shown 
rejuvenate the muscles and the livers of the older mice when their blood is replaced with that of young 
and so there are some startup companies here in silicon valley that are pretty excited about this i think 
just issued i think some large health institution issued a warning saying that this probably not a good idea 
sc yeah not yet forwardthinking people are always gonna take the risks but i wonder again in contemporary culture 
think of science fiction as trading back and forth with technological advance sometimes a technological advance is inspired by 
fiction sometimes the other way around do you think that any similar dynamic going on back then do you 
that there was any slightly overly ambitious doctor who might have tried a blood transfusion based on stories like 
or was it just a guess on the base of the poet am i really know how they would 
be able to try a blood transfusion like that i think pretty imaginary in this myth but there are 
of people making models of wings or kites in order to fly and if you think about the story 
daedalus and his son icarus daedalus wanted to escape with his son he and his son were imprisoned by 
in the labyrinth that daedalus had built himself but then now a prison for him he wants to escape 
a legendary brilliant craftsman not a god imagined as a human he makes imitation bird wings and he and 
son fly off he anticipates the weak points of his artificial wings he tells his son fly too high 
heat will melt the glue or the wax fly too low near the ocean the ocean dampness will weaken 
and of course icarus he experiences the rapture of flight and he flies higher and higher and of course 
all know the story that he plunged into the sea am and sometimes taken as a story of hubris 
that they got what they deserve for playing god by trying to fly but if you think about it 
little deeper daedalus mourns his son and then he flies on he ends up in sicily he escapes and 
his wonderful resume of marvelous animated statue so they both did succeed in flying but at a very high 
i think maybe that would be the lesson to take from that story sc yeah i mean daedalus sacrificed 
son in the name of scientific experimentation where sometimes you make an omelette without breaking a few eggs i 
something we all understand am yes right and interesting that he anticipated the weak points of his invention too 
yeah i think that these days romantically invested in the icarus part of the myth but you gotta give 
credit he really figured a whole bunch of stuff out at least according to the stories and one of 
things i wanted to ask was at least something where a chance that he was based on a real 
or real people right am yeah some some scholars have suggested that daedalus was sort of meant as a 
of conglomerate of all the brilliant craftsmen who did actually invent technologies or animated statues things like that and 
he sort of stands for all of those real artisans and crafts people and everybody wanted to claim daedalus 
claimed him and then sicily claimed him and then athens the city of athens actually revised all the myths 
make athens his birthplace chuckle so everybody wanted him as a sort of founding inventor sc and so what 
the inventions credited with the wings obviously the labyrinth which seem like as hard as making wings that will 
people fly but he has like you said a long resume of inventions to his name am well one 
the most infamous of his inventions was the artificial cow that he made for a queen pasiphaë sc oh 
the cow chuckle am she was cursed with a perverse desire to mate with a bull in her husband 
pastures she felt the gods made her fall in love with the bull and so she asked daedalus to 
her an artificial cow so that she could enter the cow and in that way fool the bull into 
sex with pasiphaë inside the cow this there are hundreds of images of this myth sc yeah a favorite 
for artists am yes and really interesting in the middle ages it was also also popular and but they 
on the actual love story between pasiphaë and the sc oh nice am so they would show her bringing 
to this sort of lovesick bull but a kind of sex toy if you think about it she animates 
by getting inside so a kind of animated statue anyway that was one of marvelous inventions sc but then 
gave birth am yes unfortunately she gave birth to the minotaur and a vase painting showing the baby minotaur 
have very many images of baby monsters but there is a vase painting that shows the baby minotaur sitting 
lap and she has a very startled look on her face and her gesture is one of anxiety chuckle 
a good reminder that even the monster minotaur was a baby once too am i know chuckle sc he 
a mommy who loved him and what else did daedalus do after that am so daedalus then invented the 
as a place where king minos could imprison his stepson the minotaur sc this is very interesting to me 
your book how much of what we know is not just textual but based on these artistic depictions on 
and so forth clear that there was a set of stories that every artist in the ancient greek or 
world knew and just loved painting am yes and it very helpful because we have to think of just 
realize how much of greek literature has been lost a lot of these myths we only have incomplete texts 
fragments and so the vase paintings can give us hints about what has been lost and versions of the 
that have been lost they can also confirm things like the vase painting i mentioned of jason using a 
to remove the bolt on ankle important for showing just how old that story was sc right right but 
goes back even further than that right so a section in your book about prometheus the titan constructing if 
wanna put it that way the human race itself so is there a sense in which we human beings 
as robots in the sense that we were originally created rather than born am of course a very deep 
question there chuckle sc yeah they even knew about evolution so they had to have some stories am and 
are we all robots and in fact plato does bring that up in one of his dialogues he says 
imagine that we are puppets made by a capricious so they thought about those questions and of course i 
that in buddhist cultures they have different ideas about robots and automatons than western cultures i delved too deeply 
this but the few ancient stories that i did find that were buddhist texts about automatons the messages seem 
be something like are all robots robots have souls and neither do so i think that that would be 
interesting to look deeper sc always a little tricky right obviously they have the exact words robots and androids 
cyborgs or something like that so we have to sort of remember that they were just talking about exactly 
same concept in different words than we would use am right and recently i was writing about the ancient 
from india about relics his bodily remains being guarded in antiquity right after he died by a set of 
warriors and they did have a word for what we would call robot or automaton and they called them 
movement machines they had a word for machine they had a word for and they called them spirit movement 
and they had a word for robot makers so yeah really hard to tease these words out have to 
a lot of reading these things are not indexed sc do you think that spirit mover what is the 
doing in there am i think that that emphasizes the mysterious origins of their movements sc okay yeah am 
the fact that they are machine the third word is machine which means some mechanized entity sc well clear 
your book that many of the uses that people imagined for these artificial beings is wartime fighting battles i 
not sure whether there were lots of battles being fought or whether just when he went down to write 
it was the most fun to write about battles but clearly stories of artificial soldiers and elephants and a 
of fun really am yes well and as we mentioned earlier a lot of the greek technology was focused 
making novel war machines so various rulers did actually hold contests for artisans and inventors to design and make 
in war machines and how philip ii came up with the torsion catapult he held a contest for that 
this brings us to the question that many people are worried about today is does technology favor tyranny or 
sc yeah i went into a much more benign direction i thought of the xprize am oh you could 
about that too yes you know interesting if you think about hephaestus the wonders that he made in his 
many of them were for the gods and goddesses they called on him when they required devices with some 
features and magnificent beauty and craftsmanship he created talos but he also had a big list of wonders a 
resume he made golden hunting dogs animated statues of watch dogs that were described in odyssey and iliad tells 
that hephaestus made a set of automated bellows for his forge these bellows could obey his commands and regulate 
blast to blow more or less air as he worked and then he devised a wondrous fleet of these 
or tripods threelegged tables on wheels that were selfdriving carts they brought nectar and ambrosia to the gods and 
at their banquets and they returned when they were empty and he made automatic gates for mount olympus the 
that would automatically open and close am these are driverless carts and automated garage doors and he also made 
team of lifesized golden maids to serve as his assistants and homer describes these robotic servants as looking exactly 
real young women but that they were endowed with sense and reason and that they were equipped with all 
knowledge of the gods and in other words that amounts to a mythological version of artificial intelligence and written 
than years ago but just as you said when you first asked this question these things are all very 
and harmless and kind of charming kind of fun to imagine when these made not born things come down 
earth like talos or pandora that well laws get broken chuckle a lot of chaos a lot of destruction 
chaos sc well very interesting to me that hephaestus clearly based on a super blacksmith someone who would forge 
and armor and things like that clearly i guess they imagined if a god and a blacksmith then also 
wizard inventor even at a time when inventing new things was not common currency am yeah and as you 
before i think there was a lot of overlap between magic and technology in antiquity especially with metalworking because 
the things you could do with bronze to an ordinary person would seem like magic using fire and molten 
and forging something that can move or look real and you could even use real things to cast bronze 
one of the things that daedalus was famous for was that he made a golden honeycomb that looked exactly 
a honeycomb well what a goldsmith could do if they cast the gold on a real honeycomb but it 
like magic in antiquity sc i have more things about hephaestus to talk about but i before i forget 
wanna go back to jason because i forgot about the teeth story which is a great one and again 
amazing modern resonances am yes it does jason had to accomplish these impossible tasks in the myth of the 
for the golden fleece and one of them was that he had to tame or somehow subdue a pair 
robobronze bulls these were robot bulls made of bronze created by hephaestus for the king who happened to be 
the one who set this task for jason and he said need to yoke these bronze firebreathing bulls and 
plow a field oh and a helmet full of teeth you need to plant these teeth in the furrows 
from these teeth will spring up an unnatural army and the crop that you will have to harvest you 
to cut down that army if you can accomplish all that by nightfall then tell you where the golden 
sc we make fun of james bond movies for having the villains come up with these cockamamie schemes but 
clearly goes back a long time before that am absolutely absolutely medea creates a special drug once again made 
ichor to give jason superhuman power this is like a human enhancement that she makes in drug form for 
so that he can overpower those bronze bulls that are snorting fire the effect only lasts one day but 
gives him superhuman strength and the description in the myth is quite interesting he sounds like turning into the 
normally a very skinny guy as we see in vase paintings shown as a very unassuming physique but she 
him him this drug and he turns into a strong man able to do all these tasks and sure 
by dusk they see that these soldiers are popping up fully armed unnatural army popping up out of the 
that he has plowed and planted the dragons teeth and now these soldiers fully armed and they are programmed 
attack they be commanded or led and they stop or halt or change direction they can only attack am 
once again medea to the rescue she figures out their vulnerabilities and she advises jason to throw rocks into 
midst and he does that and it works just like medea said it would they feel the blows or 
the blows on their shields and believe that being attacked and programmed to attack and so they attack closest 
them they attack each other so just in a frenzy hacking at each other and then jason and the 
go and finish them off so once again the one you want on your side sc and a very 
sort of technological worry about slightly bad programming i know if you know the story of the lord of 
rings movies am yes sc so they had all these armies of orcs that were all cgi and they 
them individually to make it look realistic but some of them would just sort of look for the nearest 
to fight and see anyone so just would run away from the battle so it looks like the whole 
army was just running to the three winds so programming these instructions accurately is a harder trick that it 
seem like am right and what happens if you want to if the circumstances change and you need to 
them or interrupt their train of behavior pretty difficult one ancient writer said every general would want an army 
but i think so sc yeah they need some judgement am they are very very difficult to control if 
circumstances suddenly change and some people have said we need to make ai artificial intelligence that knows when to 
for help from a human chuckle sc i mean i probably know the answer to this but did any 
these ancient sources go into any detail at all about programming or how the instructions were put into these 
am once again going to appeal to the fact that we have such incomplete record we do have so 
details about talos and yet for many of the others we have the details that might have existed in 
i found any examples of details of programming sc yeah that would be pretty advanced i be surprised if 
there but it would be curious am well there is an interesting recent discovery of a papyrus that it 
founded in the i believe that has a story of a guardian lion that was built by hephaestus to 
an aegean island and the papyrus says that special instructions for the benefit of all mankind were placed in 
lion so the most beneficial ai robot that i know of from antiquity that came to earth that was 
on earth the only beneficial one i can think of actually chuckle but was programmed by hephaestus to be 
benefit to all mankind sc yeah so speaking of hephaestus and speaking of benefits to all mankind i was 
to think of how to sort of characterize all of the different kinds of robots and ais that you 
about in the book so androids robots in human form human enhancement like what daedalus does with the wings 
the various attempts at immortality through blood transfusions and then of course there are sex robots am yes chuckle 
and we can thank hephaestus for that is that right am right hephaestus once again is commissioned by zeus 
is always portrayed as a very vindictive harsh tyrant in these myths so once again there you have tyrants 
out people who can make technology he wants to punish human kind for accepting the gift of fire from 
prometheus not only made humans but then wanted to defend them and compensate for their vulnerability by giving them 
technology of fire well he was punished for that and zeus then wants to punish humans as well so 
asks hephaestus to make an artificial woman as beautiful as a goddess but he specifically says that this entity 
is made not born will arouse lust in men and she will be evil disguised as beauty so an 
fembot who is created by hephaestus specifically to carry out a mission on earth she has this sealed jar 
urn it later became a box in the middle ages because of a mistranslation but she has a mission 
earth she is to insinuate herself in human society and then unseal that jar releasing all the miseries and 
of mankind and then we never hear of her again sc well i had this vague feeling that i 
taught that pandora was the first woman almost like a precursor to eve in some versions of the story 
there different versions or was she always robotic or once again the boundary line is just very blurry here 
in the very earliest text we have of the story of pandora comes from hesiod the epic poet hesiod 
wrote the story twice in two different works in about seven hundred bc he lives in around the time 
homer so this is an extremely ancient story and once again drawing on oral traditions and he does not 
her as the first woman he describes her as made not born and a product of technology from the 
beginning not said to be the first woman but i think she gets sort of overlaps with eve as 
story gets perpetuated and we all think of a very benign fairy tale version of pandora that she was 
innocent young woman who just restrain her curiosity and that is not the original story at all sc yeah 
return to this theme once again because i think very interesting about how many of these stories are ultimately 
tales and weird to think that they were cautionary tales about the dangers of technology since those dangers were 
very manifest at the time am right but as i say these are kind of science fiction so they 
imagining what wonders could be created if only possessed the creativity and the divine abilities of the gods or 
like medea yeah right it is interesting that they seem to be cautionary they do have lessons for us 
is it just the idea that reaching too far and being hubristic is something to be warned against and 
idea of manipulating nature through technology is just one illustration of that am well i did notice that and 
think i just mentioned earlier that these selfmoving devices and automatons that hephaestus made for his own use and 
use of the gods and goddesses in heaven are all harmless and benign and charming but the ones that 
sent to earth to interact with humans are dangerous got the killer robot talos and pandora and then the 
guard dogs and lions and creatures like that so maybe this lesson in the myths or something that we 
draw from them is that maybe trying to say that interesting to think about in a sort of abstract 
but if these technologies are going to interact with humans we need to think them over and of course 
story of pandora really emphasizes that when you think about the relationship between prometheus and his brother epimethius in 
story sc that was what relationship was yeah am yeah brothers prometheus and epimethius prometheus is the one who 
the humans and then gave them fire his name means foresight he looks ahead his brother epimethius his name 
hindsight shortsighted he never looks ahead sc okay am the greeks are capable of humor in these myths sc 
i was just gonna say predestined by your name to have certain characteristics a tough life am maybe there 
named later i know so epimethius is the perfect patsy for trick on humans this cruel trick that going 
play he sends hermes the messenger god to escort pandora down to earth and he presents pandora as a 
to epimethius and epimethius is dazzled by her beauty but prometheus tries to stop him from accepting this gift 
says a gift do not accept any gifts from zeus please do not do and epimethius shrugs him off 
goes for the shortterm gain and as hesiod the poet in seven hundred bc tells us he realized his 
too late laughter sc is there also some sort of warning against the wiles of women going on here 
is it mostly technological you think am i think that it could be interpreted that way but mostly i 
a story of caution when you think about the role of hope in the story of pandora now if 
think of the fairytale version all seen the illustrations of pandora sort of reeling back in horror when she 
this sealed box or jar but actually that was her mission and the last thing in her jar in 
sealed vessel it was hope right sc yeah am and used to seeing illustrations from fairytales european fairytales that 
hope as the sort of beautiful fairy who arise it flies up out of the jar and comforts human 
but once again not what the original myth said in antiquity greeks did not think of hope as a 
thing hope was called blind hope it robs you of foresight it makes you into an epimethean character you 
never look ahead and they really we know that they really thought about that a lot because there are 
fragments of plays about pandora and prometheus where prometheus talks about the meaning of hope and blind hope and 
question unresolved in the play and in philosophical arguments was hope the best thing or the worst thing in 
is hope a good thing for humans or a bad thing for humans sc i mean would it be 
to say that the meaning of hope in this context is closer to something like wishful thinking am i 
so yes we certainly have a lot of epimethean types in ai and robotics who assure us that so 
and creative that be fine be able to solve all the problems as they come and then we have 
who say need to step back and try to think about unexpected unintended consequences if we possibly sc yeah 
two attitudes are never gonna go away they just need to be in conversation with each other in an 
way which is all we can hope for am yeah right am now sure many other stories that are 
your wonderful book and i encourage everyone to buy it but in our last few minutes here i wanted 
completely switch topics maybe not a complete switch you tell me but written a whole another book which i 
was fascinating about amazons and seen wonder woman i know about the amazons but i i read that one 
but i think you make the case that the myth of the amazons was based to a surprising degree 
real life events is that right am yes i make that case in my book the amazons lives and 
of warrior women across the ancient world if heard of the myths of amazons then you know that there 
fierce warrior women from exotic lands to the east they lived around the black sea and beyond all the 
to central asia and what i wanted to emphasize is that the myths of the amazons were probably influenced 
real women who rode to war alongside the men in cultures around the black seas on the steps that 
known to the ancient greeks and that their lifestyle was so egalitarian when it came to male and female 
that the greeks really spun many exciting stories about amazons and the reason i feel i could make that 
is that there are some spectacular and recent archeological discoveries of the graves of hundreds of battlescarred female skeletons 
with weapons just like the men given honors like the males and buried with their weapons and their horses 
about the century bc and onwards all across the steps around the black sea and all the way sc 
so not that there was an entire society of nothing but women warriors which sort of would fail to 
reasonable for all sorts of reasons am for all sorts of reasons yes and even the greeks told other 
about amazons who actually did have relationships with men in their myths but the exaggeration of the egalitarianism led 
stories of a society of nothing but women sc and part of it was just that the greek fighting 
which was sort of brutish and handtohand would naturally favor the taller stronger men whereas the societies the cultures 
the steps were more riding on horseback shooting bows and arrows things that women could do just as well 
men could am absolutely the greek style of warfare was on foot heavily armed all armed exactly the same 
all taught the same tactics hoplite soldiers who would march in a phalanx out to meet the enemy who 
be another force of similarly armed and trained men but the scythians their ancestors were the people who domesticated 
horse and perfected the recurve bow so these cultures of scythian nomads very diverse cultures but they were culturally 
because they all were centered on archery and riding horses and if you put a woman on a horse 
a bow and arrow just as fast just as deadly as a man and their lifestyle was egalitarian because 
was a necessity for their survival everyone in the tribe learned to ride horses when toddlers and they learned 
shoot bows and arrows everyone could hunt everyone could defend the tribe just a necessity they dressed the same 
long pants or leggings trousers because you have to have those to write a horse and long sleeves very 
active wear for both the men and women and their whole society just astounded the greeks because they kept 
women at home weaving and taking care of children they have an outdoor life at all sc and everyone 
that their own local customs should be laws of nature right so the idea that other people do it 
is hard to fathom am right so i think that this outpouring of amazon tales which everyone knew these 
by heart they knew about all the stories of their greatest greek heroes had to prove themselves by fighting 
enemies and among those noble enemies were the amazon queens sc so in both of these big stories the 
about the robots and artificial intelligence ideas in antiquity and about the amazons a wonderful reminder of how the 
that we have in the modern world are prefigured in debates been having for a very very very very 
time and i think just a wonderful example in both cases of how we can still learn and expand 
minds and maybe make ourselves little bit more cultured by remembering what people were debating about and years ago 
absolutely sc alright adrienne mayor thanks so much for being on the podcast am thank you como bem diz 
exemplos para nós já debatidosconcretizados há mais de anos e que cheguemos a conclusão que nossos ancestrais eram pessoas 
e imaginação fértil einstein e imaginação nossa continuidade de muitas das suas ideias mitologia tecnologia ao serviço das nossas 
passado presente e futuro obrigada sean have you read the big nine by amy webb how much i wish 
could hear you interview her on mindscape it would be in my opinion a perfect sequel to this interview 
adrienne mayor about technology and now the book was reviewed by kaveh waddell on axios around or on march 
book has way more than the review captures however it was the review that said to me you must 
this elizabeth hi sean i suppose that i should have posted this in december on your holiday podcast but 
only discovered mindscape a few days ago and only listened to that podcast last night now you have closed 
on that episode that episode struck a chord with me because i am in the middle of setting up 
own podcast i am a retired professor of psychology who taught and published in the field of what is 
called but used to be called my main interest was in the field of drug effects and addiction in 
mid wrote a textbook on drugs and behavior that is still available in its edition over the years it 
obvious that we would never be able to understand or treat addiction until we completely revised the way we 
about human behaviour most definitions of addiction involve the fact that addicts of drug consumption i was always puzzled 
how we were supposed to tell the difference between controlled and uncontrolled behaviour it presumes free will and that 
big problems for anyone wanting to study human behavior using the scientific method if the will is really free 
means that it does not follow natural laws and is therefore not predictable and consequently it is not possible 
make testable hypotheses ie hypotheses are not falsifiable coming to grips with this insight has led me on a 
journey through philosophy neuroscience genetics quantum physics complexity and emergence i have kept track of this journey in a 
of podcasts i call grand scheme of which i launched last week i would appreciate it if at some 
your busy schedule might permit you to check out my podcasts and offer any advice you may see fit
