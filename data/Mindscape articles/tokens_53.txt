and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and of the opinion that we talk about games 
at least we talk about games enough in an intellectual sense in a sort of the theory of games 
are games why do we do them clearly a whole bunch of people playing games i just looked up 
numbers online and we spend over twice as much on video games these days as we do on movies 
the fact a lot more coverage of movies in tv and magazines twothirds of american households play video games 
at least have someone in there playing video games for more than three hours per week so video games 
our lives as do games more generally right chess go card games etcetera but what is a game the 
of it and why are we so attracted to them why do they fascinate us so sc i think 
my cats ariel and caliban in some sense play games ariel at least plays fetch but we human beings 
to great lengths to invent completely arbitrary rules play by them and then invest enormous amounts of emotion into 
we win or lose or how we do playing this game so today we have on one of the 
people who does think about these issues in detail frank lantz is a very active game designer designed a 
of video games gearheads which is a famous iphone mobile phone game csi crime city as well as various 
games where people are out there in the streets actually playing by certain rules but also the director of 
game center at nyu so part of his job is to take the bigger picture to really ask what 
are where going so this is a very fun conversation sc i do have to admit that it was 
an extremely unusual setting that we had the conversation this was a live recording at the santa fe interplanetary 
in santa fe which is a very fun event but to be honest the recording was in a big 
in a big tent with lots of other things going on so the amount of background noise is considerable 
worse i using my own equipment i was using the local equipment there and the good news is that 
was really good so hear him well my microphone sadly was not as good and also i because of 
trying to project so it sounds like shouting the entire time for the entire podcast but done what i 
to save the audio file make it as listenable as possible and like i said frank the one there 
listen to is actually very clear in this recording so i think such a good conversation on the substantive 
that well worth listening to so go music sc alright frank lantz welcome to the mindscape podcast frank lantz 
great to be here sc so i wanna put into words what it is you do although already done 
in the intro but you both design games and have this sort of academic position so why you tell 
a little bit about who you are what you do what are the games that been responsible for fl 
yeah a game designer been making games for a long time and also teach game design at nyu i 
of do both of these simultaneously the game design department is in the tisch school of the arts sc 
fl which is the same school that has the film school and acting and things like that and the 
is that the instructors there are also practitioners so we are professional game developers and people who have an 
career and a practice and so what been doing for many years now and as a game designer in 
york i made a lot of weird experimental games i had a small studio called we specialized in locationaware 
and street games games that took place in physical spaces that incorporated computers but on computers sc so they 
games in the traditional sense fl yeah instead we were sort of taking advantage of the emerging kind of 
computing technology to create new kinds of game experiences that brought back social interaction into the mix so i 
a lot of games like that i taught a class in that style of game at nyu and the 
in that class made a game called which was chuckle translating the game of pacman onto the grid onto 
street grid of new york city sc cool fl so the kinda thing that we did my studio did 
bunch of games we made a bunch of largescale social games for facebook we also did a game called 
you maybe familiar with sc an old favorite of mine fl okay good sc i spent many hours playing 
the iphone fl nice nice and yeah so made lots and lots of games over the years and then 
a couple of years ago i made a game called sc right fl which was the first time that 
had sat down to program a game myself from scratch and so that was a fun experience and the 
recent thing made sc they take over your life programming something like that fl yeah it was deeply satisfying 
and a learning experience sc i should mention very new at this in the sense that this is the 
ever time that mindscape has done a live podcast so for those of you listening over the podcast radio 
network we are here live at the santa fe interplanetary festival it will also explain why you may hear 
in the background like what i think was a theremin was just going on but it may very well 
been an alien creature talking its special language here at the interplanetary festival anything can happen so okay all 
experiences and nuance and seeing how things go so one of the wonderful things i like frank about your 
is that you have designed games programmed games coded but you also think carefully about the bigger picture which 
my favorite thing and our favorite thing here on mindscape so just be as big as we can what 
a game what qualifies some activity as being a game rather than being something else fl well i think 
game as a cultural category so it have a very precise definition that will allow you to distinguish between 
that are games and games in some kind of automatic way by looking at their internal characteristics and identifying 
instead it you know it represents a kind of a broad category of human action and i think of 
as being a creative form and something like an art form an aesthetic form so something like literature or 
or film dance that kinda thing and so gonna have all the same kind of ambiguity to precisely identify 
is or a game but to me it is the art form of interactivity it is the creative form 
designing experiences for people still trying to create something meaningful beautiful interesting popular expressive but doing it by crafting 
by crafting their choices and their actions sc so i like that the art form of interactivity so i 
to the audience an audience in front of me so i feel i should project my voice to them 
the podcast listeners are gonna be like is he shouting on the podcast he do sorry take it into 
but interactivity then so the thing like it matter that a goal matter that you can win or lose 
matter that there are other people it matter that not just looking at the work of art you are 
with it what makes it a game fl yeah and i think things like having a goal win state 
loss state those are the kinds of things that lots of games do have so when looking to identify 
a game or not having those qualities make it more likely that a game in the same sense that 
is about sound but in some cases music might be about silence right so the absence of sound mean 
not a piece of music sc sure fl this famous john cage piece you know chuckle it just is 
these are the kinds of things by which like a family resemblance thing you know wittgenstein famously sort of 
game the word game as an example of how hard it is define to anything sc yeah fl because 
know but yeah these family resemblances they do tend to be about goals but not always and sc not 
fl game designers have really been exploring the space of games that are explicitly not about goals so interesting 
you know i went through a phase when i was quasi active in second life i know if you 
did second life fl no i myself but familiar with it yeah sc well i got into it because 
was a podcast that was in second life so there was an interviewer and so forth jennifer my wife 
was one of the many hosts of this podcast and i gave public lectures in second life my impression 
always for those of the who know a massively online game in some sense but they so you had 
avatar there was a world you built a virtual world there goals though it was an open world in 
broadest sense it was like it is your play box your sand box go play with and i think 
kind of faltered because of that other virtual worlds like world of warcraft other games that are much more 
you can still build the world but also a way to win or lose from moment to moment fl 
actually fascinated by second life i think more interesting now in moribund state as this like abandoned virtual world 
the ghost world yeah fl yeah you see people like take tours of it like going to chernobyl and 
these big strange decaying ruins of corporate sponsored like sc yeah fl art locations chuckle very weird and cool 
sc well it was weird to me because it is second life it tried to mimic life like you 
have a house we had a house we had a cat in our house fl yeah sc but then 
could apparently just walk into other house and rifle around and that was weird and you know whether that 
okay or not fl yeah i mean i always thought the sort of fascination with virtual worlds was it 
in and early sc yeah fl it was a little bit misplaced the for me as a game designer 
was interesting about world of warcraft was not that it was a virtual world that happened to be a 
it was that it was a game that incorporated a virtual world right and the fact that it was 
game i thought was a really important part of that experience because a like a virtual world has the 
that this is just another type of social space but a game is a kind theatrical kind of like 
like we know entering into a kind of performance sc performative yeah fl and yeah so important in world 
warcraft that it just things like race and politics this strange representation of race and politics and then i 
a hoard i was sc okay fl i was a troll in world of warcraft and of course it 
a hoard versus alliance and it was this big kind of underlying motivation for your play and i hated 
alliance sc of course fl but it real hate right not real hate taking place in a virtual space 
was this strange kind of performative hate which is similar to what you get when you are performing a 
or looking at a painting or reading a poem you know what i mean i think the important thing 
but it can also bleed over into the real world i mean fans of one sports team can be 
not friendly with fans of another sports team fl true and i think when you get violence in sports 
is where you see a failure of the kinda ritual transformative aspect i think when working sports fandom gives 
this kind of strange toy version of the kind of totalitarian identity that we get when we just feel 
disappearing into the mob i become a mets fan or i become a yankees fan and i get to 
the pleasure of what it feels like to get rid of my actual identity all the nuance and subtlety 
being a person and being part of all kinds of different communities and instead i get to plunge into 
simplistic i and kinda beautiful because not real sc you could be a member of a tribe without all 
the terrible baggage that can sometimes go along with that in real world fl yeah yeah and it works 
we know and as even when we commit fully to it it is bracketed in a way and that 
me is part of what makes sports and games in general feel like they belong alongside the arts sc 
one of the things i noticed in second life with this podcast that jennifer was a host of so 
would interview people like you interview people in a podcast she would invite them on and they generally have 
life characters all ready so they would design it from scratch and you saw there were only two types 
were like the people who designed the most sexually attractive version of themselves right fl yes sc like buff 
and glamorous clothes fl right sc or people who went completely crazy they were a unicorn or they were 
flock of butterflies and that freedom to be something completely different was very valuable to them fl yeah sc 
still expressing something that was inside their real overlapping conversation fl yeah and i think you see that in 
playing games as well when people design avatars for themselves in morrowind or any kind of rpg kind of 
with identity in that same way sc and it brings us i should have asked this even before what 
a game what is playing like cats and dogs play right not purely human fl mmhmm sc i actually 
a cat who plays fetch like a little puppy fl sure yeah sc bring it back and her brother 
that so somewhere along evolutionary time our presumably like everything else in evolution we develop some mental machinery for 
reason and then repurposed it for another reason fl yeah sc so the hunting and the gathering or whatever 
repurposed as play do we know a lot about the evolution of play and what purposes it serves fl 
i mean i think a deep scholarship about play that comes out of anthropology and also sociology and psychology 
development science and i think one of the things fascinating about games is that it taps into this deep 
ancient form of behavior which is not only there at the beginning of human culture but really predates human 
sc right fl the sociologist huizinga who wrote this famous book called homo ludens which is about how play 
is the origin point of human culture like sc really fl yeah human culture and civilization comes out of 
and the play instant sc this sounds like one of many grandiose claims that you could either believe or 
equally well fl yeah it is chuckle but we like huizinga so gonna give him the nod in this 
but yeah i so as for what it is i think it has something to do with the power 
free exploration a lot of what we do is kinda bound and guided by our goals and our rules 
interaction and then some things we do are more exploratory more improvisational more unbounded they involve the things that 
maybe random or trial and error and you know if i pick up this bottle i know what supposed 
do which is hold it up to my lips and drink it but if i just pour some out 
the chuckle sc oh my god you did it laughter fl playful right sc right fl because exploring the 
of possible actions i can take with this bottle and not just the ones that we think of immediately 
kinda programmed to behave in certain programmed ways all the different ways like all the different things that i 
do with this bottle right so play and i think one half of games i think super interesting is 
in games you get this idea of play wild improvisation kind of unbounded energetic excess and imaginative kind of 
and in conversation with the opposite with structure sc structure yeah fl rules with goals with arbitrary goals like 
to tie one hand behind my back and now what can i do with this just and so these 
things are kind of in conversation in games right play and rules kinda freedom and structure sc rules seem 
be one of the things that goes almost inevitably along with the concept of games right and like you 
we make them up and always been psychologically fascinating to me that we invent rules and then we stick 
them like we invented them or the goal like win your golden prize for playing the game a certain 
of times on your iphone this but then they become very important to us despite the fact that we 
entirely arbitrary sc yeah and in games we get to play with rules and we get to submit ourselves 
them we get to experience the pleasure of being bound by a little arbitrary system and there is a 
kind of pleasure there but then we also are given a chance to recognize how rules are constructed like 
a game designer my job is to make rules and as as a player we encounter a game we 
step into it submit ourselves to the rules but then we finish we stop playing and we step back 
we realize the characteristics of this little set of but it could have been a different way and even 
a player you get to play with the rules you say if we do it again but this time 
both hands behind our or time not try to do this thing try to do this other and so 
gives you a sense of how rules are pliable sc and if playing solitaire say playing with real cards 
just on a phone and if i lose if i finish the deck i feel bad tempted to cheat 
why is that fl well because i think part of what you get from a game is this little 
that being tested and that a little puzzle solitaire is like a little puzzle and when you do well 
solitaire partly a reflection of the fact that smart and so when you do poorly sc lose your self 
fl yeah so almost wanting to take your temperature again to see if maybe you could get hotter sc 
gave this wonderful talk for the audience out there you should look online for a talk that frank gave 
involves two games that he compares and contrasts go and poker and take them in order because both fascinating 
their own reasons go of course is japanese originally is that right fl chinese originally sc chinese originally fl 
sc okay to asian cultures what chess is to western cultures and very formal and rigid and the rules 
very clear and people get into it and you make this wonderful analogy that it becomes like a martial 
in some sense a form of discipline to be in a good goplayer fl yeah go is an example 
the kind of game that is a very hard deep cognitive problem like the kind that scientists wrestle with 
totally separate from the idea in science that working on a problem for a particular reason because it fits 
some larger framework because by solving this problem be able to solve this other problem it might lead downstream 
some engineering breakthroughs in the case of go you are just wrestling with that problem for own sake sc 
invented it yeah fl yeah and a very deep and beautiful game and been for thousands of years and 
great example of how strange games are as an art form because we have not that many works of 
or music that people have been interacting with for thousands of years and still doing it in the same 
still getting the similar kind of value out of it still thinking about it and participating with it in 
similar way yeah and a remarkable game sc be remiss if we mention the computers are now better than 
fl yes just a great example of how games are often the ultimate test bed for artificial intelligence and 
is this iconic quintessential ai problem which just recently tumbled and maybe is the last sort of the last 
the last kind of fullfledged human game that humans are really good at sc well get to poker in 
second fl yeah sc but it took longer for computers to win at go against the best built players 
at chess fl it did and people i think a little bit overinterpreted that they were like well chess 
course of course computer is gonna go to chess because look at it you can see that combinatorial and 
can just crunch through and look at all the possibilities but go go requires intuition and deep insight and 
these kind of chuckle sc really did they say that fl i think there was a sense of that 
especially among game designers for whom one of the beauties of go is that it does require intuition and 
there is an ineffable quality like you talk about things like shape and these kind of nebulous concepts not 
sitting down and crunching through if i go there you go there i go there you go there you 
do have these hardtopin down concepts and so i think people thought oh well this will be our bull 
against ai and last for a long but of course it it last long sc so for those who 
never seen it how big is the go board fl nineteen by sc so nineteen by nineteen grade and 
put either white or black pebble stones fl yeah you can alternate blackandwhite stones sc so part of me 
to say be a scientist here for a second a finite game only a finite number of things that 
happen fl sure sc but the other part says but that number is really really big so of course 
real human beings play go just like playing chess we in our brains try to go through every combinatorial 
we use heuristics we use our intuition we look at the shape of the board we get a feeling 
talk about the energy that comes off of different configurations of the pieces and of course then you ask 
computer to do it it was i heard a talk here at santa fe institute fact by former professional 
player who like many professional go players gave up when the computer won because they compete now with the 
but one of the things we learned was one of the things that holding the artificial intelligence back from 
a really good go player was that they trained it on human games first and it actually turned out 
be much better if they just let it play against itself without ever poisoning it with human intuition fl 
was the real headline with alphago was that it got so much better when we stopped trying to seed 
with the centuries of knowledge that humans had developed with all of our insights all of our heuristic all 
our ways of teaching go we just left that out and instead we gave it the rules and then 
gave it a technique for playing against itself and a preference for winning and it did so much better 
was really kind of an interesting lesson there about humility sc and some of the players used words like 
playing against an because the computer used concepts that the humans thought of before fl but it was still 
the thing is that the go experts who are watching alphago still found the moves that alphago made that 
surprising to be exquisite and so that was exciting to me sc a beauty there absolutely yeah fl yeah 
a beauty that is on one hand nonhuman or inhuman because it surprised us and it came out and 
the other hand deeply human because it is go itself expressing itself it and a project like alphago is 
result of hundreds of people thousands of people collaborating and working together and building on each insights and knowledge 
make this piece of engineering so in some sense deeply human and i think a nice thing sc it 
humans who had the motivation to invent the game if the computer never got to play another game it 
frustrated but we what comes from us human beings and why i like this idea of using games like 
almost as a tool of selfdiscipline as a almost like a meditative monk like or martial art like practice 
training ourselves to be a slightly better people than we are fl yes the way i like to think 
it is that a way of thinking about thinking go itself is a way of thinking about thinking and 
intelligence is also a way of thinking about thinking and when people play go i think this is true 
as long as people have played go been doing the kind of artificial intelligence research chuckle sc okay fl 
know what i mean because sc i know what you mean explain what you mean fl well been thinking 
if i take this little isolated problem and devote all of my thinking in fact devote my entire like 
serious go player like a serious player of any truly deep competitive game gives up the rest of their 
to explore this thing sc and if that were world of warcraft we would say terrible but if go 
think beautiful or chess fl yeah and so in the case of a game like go which is about 
making what doing is saying going to sacrifice my life in order to explore in the deepest possible way 
it means to solve problems what it means to apply every fiber of my cognitive ability to solving a 
precise and specific kind of problem and to go deep and to watch it unfold and it turns out 
fascinating and beautiful not trivial even though a an extraordinarily simple game with only a handful of rules sc 
maybe this is a good place to mention the idea that if you just say games especially in our 
culture where that has slightly the connotation of video games people worry it has a slightly disreputable connotation this 
something that kids do distracting them for more important things if you had said chess or go maybe they 
get the fact that a more elevated sublime thing fl yeah sc but is it really different or all 
have an aspect of this fl i think people are right to be suspicious of games a game designer 
my life to making games and playing games and i love them very deeply but games by their very 
have to live outside of ordinary life and we should be suspicious of them laughter fl i think art 
the same way right people are also suspicious of art we spend all your time reading these stupid books 
just reading comic books or obsessed with music and hanging out with your friends playing that noise instead of 
something practical and useful sc yeah fl so i think in that sense yeah games occupy this weird space 
of our kind of ordinary system of values and they should their job is to be out there doing 
stuff and exploring the edges of what we know and think and imagine sc so part of my job 
the podcast host is to be slightly contrary and play the advocate a little bit here fl okay sc 
go or chess might be very beautiful even world of warcraft can be beautiful in some way there are 
games that are really really simple and yet hard to ascribe the same level of beauty to them and 
they really get us they get their hooks into us and they become addictive fl yes sc a one 
the gaming companies is called addicting games what they shoot for maybe tetris was the first very well known 
on the computer fl yeah sc but this is definitely a goal of certain game designers to make a 
simple game that will prevent people from ever putting their phone down fl and i think we can look 
slot machines as a case in point of this right slot machines are games i would say and there 
a very dark energy to slot machines slot machines ruin lives not everyone some people who have a healthy 
to slot machines and they actually get some meaning and pleasure and joy and beauty out of slot machines 
literally no skill by the way right essentially pushing a button or pulling fl yes yeah the kind of 
the quintessential version of a slot machine no skill and you can be an advantage gamer who finds slot 
and sc sure fl certain payoffs and use your intelligence to actually get a little bit of an edge 
just say in the case in the classic case a slot machines just pure randomness sc i love the 
there are slot machine tournaments fl there are i mean yeah there are people to make a living playing 
machines you know but anyway the thing is so slot machines do have a kind of dark energy and 
are right to be anxious about that and i think good game designers know that they have a kind 
aversion to that type of game they recognize that they could do that you can put that into your 
but most good game designers want to make a game that is more than just compelling that does more 
just the player to wanna keep doing it they wanna make the kind of game that they themselves love 
kind of game that after you played it happy that you did and you look back and you say 
added something of value to my not god sick to my stomach because just wasted my time and energy 
but never that simple right sc yeah fl because sometimes great games can have a little bit of dark 
in them just like great art can have a little bit of dark energy a little selfdestructive energy right 
so we wanna we wanna be careful not to be too dogmatic and to say well we can apply 
moral filter to games and understand good and bad about because the role of games like the role of 
is not just to be good or bad but to explore what being good or bad means right and 
do that if you start from a starting point where like i know what bad is bad slot machines 
bad what addiction is bad right sc yeah fl no so part of what a game like my game 
i hope which i think is kind of addictive has addictive elements what i hope i really hope is 
not just addictive but it is in a sense about addiction like it gives people kind of a toy 
of a thing that is a little bit like heroin laughter fl but also a little bit like sudoku 
a little bit like like tetris and a little bit like a painting or a little bit like a 
or a little bit like weaving and it takes all of these things and combines them in a way 
i hope gives people some insight and perspective into how their mind works and why they enjoy it and 
just a kind of like a black box that they disappear into does that make sense sc it makes 
lot of sense but i wanna say parenthetically for the cosmology aficionados in the audience that this is a 
sense of the word dark energy than we use in cosmology fl oh or is it sc or is 
laughter sc yes it is it definitely is fl okay it is sc but do we know anything about 
neuroscience of what makes it addicting is are there some games that just poke your dopamine receptors fl we 
the psychologist know a lot about sort of reward schedules and in the case of slot machines for example 
makes them so powerfully compulsive is that the rewards are intermittent that yeah not able to predict them and 
these famous experiments where rats if they push a button and they always get a pellet do that until 
their fill but if they push a button and occasionally get a pellet do that until they die sc 
fl yeah do that sc yeah fl and so this kind of intermittent reward schedule is a big part 
what makes something truly compulsive but i tend to be a little bit skeptical of that sometimes i will 
calls from journalists and be like me how these evil corporations making these addictive mobile games are using these 
and i have no doubt that these big companies do employ psychologists but i actually think that easy and 
i think if it were everyone would do it sc yeah fl right i think even in the case 
slot machines if you talk to people who design slot machines they always know what is going to be 
try a bunch of different kinds of slot machines and it turns out this golden girls machine is doing 
well this batman machine is a turd sc you have to be an empiricist not all pr yeah fl 
exactly so still this sense of trial and error and in some sense still a kind of a creative 
and i think for me in terms of games the important thing to remember is games are culture games 
not primarily technology games are a form of culture that has this deep relationship to technology but they are 
simply technology not simply devices not things that you plug in and then you get a hedonic pulse and 
like a coffee machine instead they are more like hats you know what i mean why did everyone wear 
for a while why did every single man in every social space wear this same hat for a while 
was all people did right is that addiction weird so i think games even addictive games have that weird 
in them which makes them hard to you just plug in a formula and guarantee that have something popular 
compulsive or successful sc never happened to me but has it maybe happened to you that been playing a 
so much that you fell asleep and while you were dreaming you kept playing the game fl yes in 
tell you the game that did that to me in the most powerful way was a game by david 
everything sc okay fl a beautiful game if never played it i really recommend it you can play it 
the playstation and an exploration of the thinking of alan watts the great zen philosopher and david this brilliant 
made the game in such a way that if you stop controlling it for a while it sort of 
starts playing itself chuckle fl and so if you just put it the controller down after a while slowly 
to just kind of randomly do actions and move through the space and explore it and i was playing 
very late one night and i was very tired and i was already kind of in this loopy kind 
state of mind and listening to the voice of alan watts talk about transcendence and mindfulness and i was 
out of consciousness and then occasionally i would wake up and the game would be playing and i even 
whether it was me or not sc was it you or the game yes fl yeah it was a 
beautiful experience sc wow yeah i think that a lot to learn that we yet know about the psychology 
this my personal theory about tetris and even and these other games where that some threshold where every time 
lost you felt if done one little thing better i would have won so therefore i should play fl 
think the mark of a good game in many cases sc yeah fl in many cases what trying to 
as designers is create just that experience where lost but there was meaning to my loss i understand now 
i should have done and so what the player is doing is building up a little model of the 
that you designed and they have hypotheses and then they do little experiments and i think a lot of 
of like toy science in a lot of games sc oh absolutely experimenting yeah fl and so yeah this 
of the player kind of wanting to understand what made and going deeper and deeper so that feeling of 
i know what i wanna try differently this time ooh i love i also love it in a game 
i get this feeling that something here is broken i bet i can exploit i bet a thing here 
the designer has not thought of and so going to use an axe and not gonna wear any armor 
i bet gonna get this and so that feeling of something being almost broken or the potential of it 
broken to me catnip sc well it goes back to your selfimage right fl yes sc playing game to 
reaffirmation that actually pretty clever fl i am pretty clever laughter sc speaking of being pretty clever switch from 
we got off go a little bit but this idea of a sublime martial art that we use to 
ourselves to poker which is actually one of my favorite games and you wonderfully contrast this idea of sitting 
the tranquil zen garden and playing very slowly and deliberately and engaging your most rational mind to the degenerate 
that we get in the poker community in vegas fl yeah these sc or on a mississippi riverboat fl 
two games that played most deeply in my life in some ways are very similar but yeah they have 
go is sort of like the beloved of game design snobs and it has this ancient game and kind 
like a sacred ritual and a lot of respect and a kind of deep culture and then poker of 
is the game you play when crouched down next to the slot machines and you know set up a 
table and yeah listening to the chime of the slot machines and bringing you free drinks and not even 
whether good or not because you think cleverly exploiting some edge that you have but maybe not maybe you 
suck and you even know right so it puts you in this totally opposite frame of mind sc one 
those fascinating things about poker for me is that it is clearly advantageous for you if your fellow players 
an idiot you can exploit that but such an enormous psychological desire for your fellow players to think brilliant 
you resist taking advantage of that fl yeah and such a beautiful game because it involves all of the 
of problem solving that cognitive problem solving that goes into go still lots of math in poker and lots 
ways to apply yourself and develop a kind of serious scholarly discipline to really plumbing the depths of how 
thing works as a system and at the same time deeply social so much about tapping into your ego 
the ego of other people also how we predict each other the models that we have for each behavior 
sc the most social thing having a model of what your opponents are going to do and then manipulating 
model by talking to them by not talking by hiding fl right but it involves a kind of empathy 
you be good at poker unless you can put yourself into the shoes of your opponent and think what 
they and then doing the same thing to you so you get this strange chuckle reciprocal quality are they 
and just mindblowing one of the things that led john von neumann to invent game theory but he looked 
poker and sc one of the smartest people in the century fl yeah and he was like oh he 
poker to go sorry go to chess and he was like chess is not really a game chess is 
just a math sc yeah we just solved it yet fl poker now a game because it involves this 
between people where all about what i think you think i think this deeply convoluted back and forth of 
each and what he wanted to understand sc and yet jim mcmanus who is a writer who wrote a 
book about poker pointed out that at least for a long time every poker book had six shooters on 
cover of the book even though they have nothing to do with playing poker this image of outlaw of 
of living on the edge that is the opposite of the image that we have in chess or go 
but i do love the mythic figure of the gambler and to me always been a sc an archetypical 
yeah fl it really is a romantic ideal because i think what the gambler sc the aliens are landing 
somewhere nearby but gonna press on chuckle fl what the mythic archetype of the gambler represents is the person 
has trained themself or by their very personality has a taste for variance a taste for risk if willing 
eat risk you can profit from it and so something powerful and strange about that because i think randomness 
probability these are things that as humans still trying to wrap our heads around we still quite understand how 
think about sc terrible at it yeah fl even in physics this deep debate about how to interpret randomness 
whether it exists sc or philosophy we know the definition of probability fl yeah exactly and here we have 
poker an art form devoted to it which in its own way is about getting at some of the 
questions of how does the world work is everything deterministic or not sc yeah but the idea of expectation 
the idea of not being resultsoriented is one that i love in go or in chess a right or 
move in every circumstance even if you know what it is but in poker you might make the best 
move and still lose fl yes and which is what makes it so incredibly maddening you can work so 
and you can be sitting at a table of people who are only there to party and never once 
about how to play or what the right move is and you can be playing at such a high 
and they can just be making the donkiest moves ever and they can take all of your money and 
can do it over and over and over again and just soulcrushing but what makes it to my mind 
because you have to overcome that kind of soulcrushing quality and then the sense in which poker can be 
spiritual discipline just like go was sc we should give some practical advice to the audience if you want 
make money playing poker vegas am when not been drinking is the best time to play be plenty of 
who are there just to have a good time fl yes chuckle fl if you wanna make money at 
come play me tonight john and i are gonna have a game and just terrible laughter sc but it 
a different kind of game because in some sense more realistic than go it been abstracted down to this 
set of situations a game of incomplete information we know going to happen and that some of the fun 
and i also think a harder ai problem for that reason too sc empirically it is yeah fl because 
does involve this kind of reciprocal modeling and guessing and the same kind of ai problem if all trying 
do is develop a cast iron strategy that is not exploitable in other words if all you wanna do 
develop a strategy that no one else can have a strategy that will get money from it sc on 
you can tie at worst fl yeah yeah a perfect strategy in that sense just a a hard problem 
in some sense a knowable problem that we understand how to solve that kind of problem and but if 
problem trying to solve is how can i make a strategy that is flexible enough to adapt to the 
play of my opponents in a way to maximize the edge i have against other players who are not 
perfectly then you have a higher level problem then you have all of the psychology of interpreting people understanding 
their strategy is from their actions and they might be doing it to you at the same time sc 
go is human then poker is even more so for exactly these reasons fl yeah yeah poker is superhuman 
and you have this wonderful quote from phil ivey who is arguably the best poker player in the world 
now i just saw it last night so i know if you remember the quote or i should give 
fl you give it and tell you if right sc roughly speaking phil ivey just chitchatting with other poker 
in the middle of the game said know when you lose so much money that you breathe i love 
fl yeah he said what addicted sc what addicted to right yeah fl and it was beautiful because this 
i think in poker after dark or one of these other great tv shows and so he even aware 
necessarily it was kind of like in the background in the chatter and it was very honest and as 
as i heard that i got chills this idea that that weird feeling of being sick to your stomach 
pain that is the thing that he was addicted to i was like recognize and again there was a 
there that there was a kind of destructive energy not a good thing not here to tell you this 
all sweetness and light and poker is wonderful and you no this is horrifying and it is destructive but 
also can be deeply meaningful and deeply beautiful so that what addicted to chuckle sc but also a central 
of gaming not just poker where you lose a lot of money but even if a spectator we just 
the nhl and nba playoffs right most teams end their season on a losing note most fans are disappointed 
the end of the season they win the championship that sense of loss being maybe not ineffable but at 
likely is a big part of what brings us to these games fl yes unless like me you are 
north in which case i was very happy sc oh okay well there you go but you know that 
of time fl no i sc as a philadelphian i would say that you kind of got lucky that 
embiid was sick during the playoffs fl perhaps perhaps yeah sc alright despite all of this masochism and love 
variants and losing and so forth games are art how should we societally change our view fl the word 
is so overloaded that sc no lets go there lets just lean into it fl something similar to an 
form in the same sense that pop music is an art is an art form a creative form an 
aesthetic form in that sense i think you can dictate to culture how culture should interpret things i think 
is so complicated and nebulous this process i try to contribute in my work as a teacher or as 
designer as someone who is out giving talks and stuff i do try to get people to be aware 
what it is that people who love games what it is that they love because i think it can 
confusing if outside of the world of games looking in it can look like nonsense it looks like an 
in a cartoon factory like what is happening this weird violent junk that my kid is obsessed with and 
do hope that i can help people who look at that understand no part of what your kid is 
is deep problem solving part of what your kid is doing is exploring a complex system and forming hypotheses 
trying to get better at it part of what your kid is doing is developing discipline part of what 
is social and collaborative sc a big part these days yeah fl yeah and so that and in some 
yeah some most kids play too many video games laughter they probably do sc sure always a balance fl 
but understanding what is happening under the hood and what is valuable about that i think is the first 
toward developing kind of collectively evolving into a more sophisticated audience that demands better games that has a more 
and refined sense of taste for what makes a good game and pushes the art form in the right 
sc i was at a conference maybe fifteen years ago so just to put it in social context but 
was about science and drama and narrative so it was mostly about scientists talking to writers and english professors 
some conversation was happening and i came up with the idea i raised my hand and said we gonna 
a few decades from now that the newest most exciting form of story telling is and everyone said no 
not stories stories only one thing that happens you have a story where not sure gonna happen i think 
we know better now fl yeah i think some of the most interesting stuff happening in games is these 
forms of storytelling and both in a traditional sense where you just have great characters and rich world building 
into game experiences and also in the kind of avantgarde sense of exploring what a story is what a 
can be and new forms of narrative and new forms of storytelling yeah a lot happening in that world 
interesting sc and for the audience maybe not everyone is calibrated here compare the size of the video game 
to the size of the movie industry right now fl bigger i know chuckle fl this is contentious sc 
spend a lot more money on videogames than on movies fl contentious but i think by most measures it 
basically the sort of biggest pop cultural industry right now so when a game like red dead redemption two 
out not just the biggest game launch in history the biggest entertainment launch in history so yeah in terms 
overall scale as a commercial industry immense which is great for me because as someone who is excited about 
creative possibilities i get to kind of tagalong i get to hijack this rising tide this commercial tide which 
not my primary interest i wanna make games that make money i want people to buy my game but 
interested in the creative potential and so good a good healthy i think mix honestly sc but a difference 
other forms of mass market entertainment in that some barrier to entry siloed a little bit when a really 
movie comes out everyone knows about it whether or not they go to see it whereas huge numbers of 
who have no idea what talking about when you talk about red dead redemption fl yeah but maybe less 
less so over time maybe just a generational thing and maybe those sc does every know about red dead 
fl i think a pretty wellunderstood touchstone of culture as much an i guess maybe the avengers yeah maybe 
as well known as that but partly because the avengers lives or dies as spectacle whereas red dead redemption 
it is an activity and a hobby almost lives and dies by a slightly different cultural logic not just 
imprinting itself as an image sc a little bit less ephemeral as well fl yeah it is about creating 
place and a space that draws people in and so maybe part of the difference right sc and highlighted 
interplay of emotion and logic i think is how you put it fl yeah sc and certainly a way 
a video game can be where purely pristinely logical right adding up numbers or getting the shortest path and 
a way a game can i have said video any game fl right sc where more experiential more emotional 
about how feeling in the moment and is it slightly overgeneralizing or is it okay to say a sweet 
where both engaging fl you know i think of it in terms of a sweet spot where you have 
two things and in conflict instead i think you have these two different mindsets the kind of logical rational 
of maybe reductionist and kind of conscious problem solving and then you have the mindset of this kind of 
intuitive imaginative improvisational mindset that is more fluid and less kind of logical and analytical i think of those 
as being opposed necessarily i think kind of woven together in a game and so for an example you 
the game chess which in one sense is this kind of purely logical exercise of problem solving analytical problem 
and yet the chess itself is something like an art form doing this analytical problem solving because you find 
beautiful because there is an emotional connection to it because you find it expressive and meaningful and beautiful in 
that you precisely articulate fl and so in a sense this logical problem solving is embedded in something that 
entirely illogical not logical to devote your life to playing chess highly illogical laughter sc depends on what your 
are right fl yeah sc yeah fl but we do it because we find it beautiful and we find 
meaningful and so these things i think are wrapped around each other more of a fractal structure than it 
a kind of a dialectical structure sc certainly something even with chess or go there are styles of play 
if you thought of it as a purely logical expression of trying to win you might not think there 
be styles fl what makes magnuson thorny in his play i forget how they describe his play but like 
as someone who is stubborn and all doing is solving a math problem sc yeah fl but it shows 
that even in the realm of solving math problems there is nuance there are deep kind of heuristics that 
will never get to the bottom of right even when problems are welldefined the path that you take through 
space can be totally irreducible sc and individualistic fl yeah and an expression of who you are as a 
sc i remember i was on a panel once with garry kasparov who i like to introduce him as 
last human being who is the best chess player in the world fl right yeah sc now computers who 
the best but he said something i thought that was very interesting his personal style was very aggressive very 
and there was a conventional wisdom that that was not the right way to play fl yeah sc and 
said when the computers came along they played that way he felt he felt redeemed fl yeah sc he 
vindicated that way fl you know funny when professional chess players talk about play they often use concepts from 
this is another thing i love about games is that when you go deep on any one system you 
these resonances right and so they talk about a lot in professional chess tournament level chess play a lot 
predicting what your opponent is gonna do what openings are they gonna bring what things are going to work 
against them sc you wanna spend your time thinking about the right pathways right fl yeah and you can 
have bluffing in chess right you can make a move and hope that your opponent thinks a good move 
in fact you know for sure whether it was or not but trying to kind of like rattle them 
i just love i love this mix between we think we have these categories we think we know the 
between logic and emotion but i think games highlight the ways in which these things bleed into each other 
and i like the idea having styles in these different kinda games a different aspect of this fact that 
help with selfdiscovery right not just selfdiscipline but selfexpression sort of figuring out who we are fl yeah i 
agree and i think any game that you play is an opportunity to learn something about yourself an opportunity 
be on this path of selfimprovement selfovercoming you know what i mean like this path that i personally wanna 
on as a human where where not just good at what doing but kind of improving my idea of 
good means like what type of person am i trying to be and i think games give you an 
to do that and you have to and most games are not like that most people who play games 
that and many people who play games just wasting their time and just disappearing into a pleasant experience and 
but i think along the way always this potential and that what gets me excited sc if we think 
the history of game design are we getting better at connecting with the sublime in our games is that 
that is valued in the community fl i think we are i think we are getting better and better 
is not to say that like a simple straight forward path that over time we just get better at 
yeah fl instead this weird circuitous thing like all forms of culture are we getting better at music sort 
and yet there are ancient pieces of music that i find deeply moving and so i think games are 
as a design discipline i do think we are developing new methods and better kinds of best practices and 
sense of how to do this really difficult challenging task slightly better but it is irreducible yeah sc yeah 
aspect of the selfdiscovery is given that there are an aspect of being addicted or being in a zone 
losing yourself another aspect of games that let you become more conscious of processes that were unconscious right you 
that wonderful example of a game where you tried to just walk with four keys on the keyboard and 
that walking is really hard if you have to tell your legs what to do fl yeah this wonderful 
by a close friend of mine bennett foddy who also teaches at nyu yeah qwop which is just a 
where walking chuckle sc harder than it sounds fl and hilarious because what he did was create this incredibly 
control scheme where you control different limbs and so it turns this trivial thing into this deeply complicated thing 
you can get good at it sc i did not get good at it in the ten minutes that 
spent fl give yourself time sc okay maybe i do it chuckle so what do you think we should 
up in a little bit two things you can answer which one first you want one is speculate crazily 
the future of gaming will it become a bigger and bigger entertainment behemoth or will it sort of blur 
the cultural milieu so that games are everywhere in some sense and the other is sure we have a 
audience in terms of some people are avid gamers some people have never done it for those who have 
done it how should they approach games are there certain games they should think about playing is there a 
drug fl i wanna answer the second sc okay fl okay the first question too hard to predict culture 
well you have to answer both you could just choose which ordering is all you can choose fl do 
first one first and just knock it out of the park and then move on the job of a 
designer is to answer that question right every game designer is trying to figure out what the future of 
is and is going to be and what it should be and so in the process of making games 
are actively fulfilling that kind of role of predicting what the future games is gonna be so my short 
to that sc fine fl the second question of yeah a lot of times people come up to me 
of game should i play how do i get into this what i like to tell them is find 
game that your friends are playing and play that so much more important that you play a game as 
of a living community than that you play the right game play a game that other people are playing 
you can then talk to them about it you can learn from them you can say what did you 
what did sc yeah fl get very far stuck or that you can play with them and think about 
game as being part of a social practice where people communicate with each other through the game i think 
think more important than playing just the right kind of little masterpiece going this whole idea of masterpieces you 
what i mean we have a running joke in game design about citizen kane chuckle fl this citizen kane 
games but i think games by their nature are so squirrely right they are so evanescent and so weird 
they fit into that little tidy box of what a masterpiece is right they fit into this thing where 
i can take an object and put it on a pedestal and look at it and see its characteristics 
thereby get some aesthetic experience because and so less important that you play cinco paus the greatest game that 
could play right now a game i love my game designer named michael brough more important that you play 
that you have a context a social context for and that you can talk to people about and learn 
be motivated to participate in sc so an introvert part of me inside that says i just wanna ignore 
people when playing but then i remember a really good poker table really matters the other people playing with 
a huge part of the experience fl yeah really true i often think if i were in a place 
i was given an i was with a bunch of people and i was giving an option you can 
into room a and play this game that you know is a great game but play with these people 
are maybe a bunch of jerks or you go in this other room and play a game that maybe 
not so good on its own but with these wonderful people that you love and you think are really 
and clever always better to do the second thing sc a lot to think about about the future of 
i think that just starting really with where games can go so frank lantz thanks so much for being

audio conference scheduled for oct this year in los angeles the game industry itself seems to debunk the idea 
the gaming industry is bigger than the movie industry there are several reasons listed one of which the usual 
deflate movie industry revenues by only including box office receipts while including every revenue source for games headsets playstations
