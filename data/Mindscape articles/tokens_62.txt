people never drink wine for others an indispensable part of an enjoyable meal whatever your personal feelings might be 
seems to exhibit a degree of complexity and nuance that can be intimidating to the nonexpert where does that 
come from and how can we best approach wine to answer these questions we talk to matthew luczy sommelier 
wine director at mélisse one of the top finedining restaurants in the los angeles area matthew insisted that we 
drink wine rather than just talking about it so drink we do therefore in a mindscape first i recruited 
third party to join us and add her own impressions of the tasting science writer jennifer ouellette who i 
would be available because married to each other we talk about what makes different wines distinct the effects of 
and the right bottle to have with pizza you are free to drink along at home with exactly these

to close sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and this is 
special episode of mindscape having enough special episodes that you might begin to think that every episode of mindscape 
special and you might be right about that but this one is a departure always wanted to get into 
only sort of academic kind of things but also the realm of ideas out there in the real world 
things like music which already talked about movies and also food and drink so i always thought be fun 
have an episode of mindscape devoted to the idea of wine some people never drink wine for others an 
part of an enjoyable meal whatever your personal feelings might be wine seems to exhibit a degree of complexity 
nuance that can be intimidating to the nonexpert where does that complexity come from and how can we best 
wine to answer these questions we talk to matthew luczy sommelier and wine director at mélisse one of the 
finedining restaurants in the los angeles area matthew insisted that we actually drink wine rather than just talking about 
so drink we do therefore in a mindscape first i recruited a third party to join us and add 
own impressions of the tasting science writer jennifer ouellette who i knew would be available because married to each 
we talk about what makes different wines distinct the effects of aging and the right bottle to have with 
you are free to drink along at home with exactly these wines or some other choices but i think 
podcast will be enjoyable whether you do or not support mindscape on patreon or paypal mattew luczy is a 
sommelier as judged by the court of master sommeliers he currently works as the wine director at mélisse in 
monica california he is also active in photography and music click to show episode transcript sc now wine obviously 
a huge topic there are many many things you could talk about but ideally be able to sort of 
at the beginning give useful information to people who knew nothing about wine or even had had some and 
it but also give some useful insight to people who are experts and connoisseurs i think that we have 
that this is our very fun episode happily i happen to know matthew luczy who is guest he is 
sommelier at melisse restaurant here in los angeles for those of you who are not locals melisse is twomichelinstarred 
probably the most sophisticated traditional fine dining white table cloths frenchamerican cuisine restaurant that you can find here in 
angeles really not that much competition in fact sc job is both to curate the wine list at melisse 
then to serve the wine in the restaurant so a very influential person in the southern california wine world 
see at a quite young age also very approachable very knowledgeable and very much of the opinion that everyone 
enjoy wine in their own way when i asked him to be on the podcast he was very enthusiastic 
he said course i have to bring so yes we will actually be tasting wine in realtime here on 
episode of mindscape and because we did that i thought it would be fun to do another experiment and 
in a third person for the podcast my lovely wife jennifer ouellette who is a science writer and who 
know from drinking wine with her is much better at tasting wine than i am she is one of 
super tasters who is especially sensitive to cruciferousness and bitterness and so forth so we have some overlap in 
tastes but a little bit different so a new perspective and of course also written articles about the science 
taste and smell and climate change and how affecting wine and so forth sc we have a lot of 
we start at the beginning we taste both california wines and french wines and we compare them and we 
from everything like what you should serve with truffles to what you should serve with cheeseburgers and i think 
an eye opening experience matthew has some he has opinions which is good what you want in a podcast 
his opinions are not the same as everybody which is also very good so gonna learn something gonna have 
i recommend if possible that you have this podcast on at home with some wine in front of you 
you could and if in the car listening then also fine but be sure to remember some of the 
we say bring them back home because this is definitely one of the more educational and useful episodes that 
have here on mindscape so go music sc matthew luczy welcome to the mindscape podcast matthew luczy thank you 
much sean honor sc this is gonna be an unusual episode of mindscape for a variety of reasons one 
just the topic is a little bit different i say no such thing as what we talk about but 
often do a lot of science and philosophy and things there will be science and philosophy but mostly talking 
wine ml yes sc and food in a kind of aesthetic experience that we often get to hear so 
second reason why different is gonna be tasting wine sadly the audience is not gonna be tasting wine along 
us i think probably half the audience listens in the car so they definitely be but ml not recommended 
not recommended but you know look if doing that at home i will list the wines on the website 
they can buy and taste along with us be awesome ml then highly recommended in that case sc highly 
third reason is because we have a special guest jennifer ouellette famous science writer say hi jennifer jennifer ouellette 
everybody sc jennifer is also as many listeners will know my spouse and we brought her here to give 
a little bit of an extra opinion about the wines that tasting famously her palate is much more refined 
sensitive than mine listen to what i say but listen to what she says of course i think i 
that part of our lesson will be that palate is different so be good anyway matthew thanks so much 
coming tell us a little bit about who you are how you got here what does it mean to 
a sommelier ml well okay so a sommelier is one that looks after and serves wine in a restaurant 
i would define it a lot of definitions to it but i think the restaurant aspect of it is 
i got into it young i definitely had three year headstart as far as sc on the legal age 
ml on the legal side of it yeah just to make sure sc from local california ml from central 
yeah mariposa california right outside yosemite national park yeah i got a headstart just to make sure i could 
all the testing as soon as possible sc very good cheating ahead of time ml yes sc and so 
is a specific thing why were you drinking wine rather than the cheap beer that most kids that age 
be drinking ml well just always been interested in and fascinated by things with a lot of variables and 
why things work and always been into music also so kind of an artistic side and it sort of 
clicked with me that wine seemed to be the most artistic way to go about drinking essentially and like 
said from california most of my friends are older than i am and my early mentors were into california 
and where i started and i was kind of in the formative years while working in a restaurant and 
disliking it chuckle ml a lot of people are working in restaurants is while doing something else especially in 
angeles and i was like bad fairly easy way to make solid amount of money and how do i 
deal with wine how do i just isolate and i went to melisse on a total whim with my 
friend and we just had our minds absolutely blown he got super into the culinary world bought the alinea 
and the french laundry cookbook and i spent eight hours making one sc but he was the food side 
just to do it yeah and then i forked off and was like how do i be a and 
it would really be cool to be the sommelier here and that literally happened sc it worked that never 
overlapping conversation ml yeah yeah that actually happened and so yeah i did the testing the first two levels 
the court of master sommeliers as called when i was and went to melisse so over the course of 
couple of years trying to get hired and i was obviously young and at that point have any fine 
experience and one of those things where how do you get experience without having experience sc yeah right ml 
do i break in well go somewhere a bunch of times and bug them until they say yes you 
work one day a week and then that becomes two and then that becomes an assistant and then someone 
and the wine director sc i mean for the people i think that we have an audience where some 
are gonna be wine experts and some will never have tasted say good wine or wine at all what 
it that makes wine wine is it that makes it so special what differentiates it from on the one 
gin or scotch but also for that matter apple juice or diet coke ml well certainly gin and scotch 
a place i think they do it to the level that wine does i really think that an intrinsic 
of locality to wine as in like this vineyard not going across the street to the next vineyard like 
hyper zoomed in combined with that from a vintage from one year and it changes over time some liquors 
but not in the same way that wine does a life span and a trajectory to it that is 
and again with so many variables that go into it a lot of bs that goes into it unfortunately 
it is also unfortunately can be an easily pretentious topic laughter sc i have never heard of that laughter 
and yeah and i really like that and wine is fascinating and wine is cool and some people make 
not that way sc is there anyway to put that in terms of the actual product i mean something 
about wine i mean that in the good way not in the bad way ml yeah sc but something 
wine that lends itself to endless variety in a way that bourbon does not ml yeah well so without 
a biologist but from what i do understand about the way wine works so the grapes that make up 
are called vitis vinifera that is everything that you produce wine from forks off of that so pinot noir 
merlot syrah nebbiolo tocai friulano or whatever it is all vitis vinifera sc a type of grape ml yes 
their berries are about a third of the size i wanna say as of table grapes like concord grapes 
harsher if you just eat one in a vineyard especially red i mean if you understand tannin and you 
get a chance to go walk around a vineyard close to harvest you will understand it better so it 
easily and splits off into different not forms but like pinot noir pinot gris those are linked the sauvignon 
and cabernet franc are the mother and father respectively of cabernet sauvignon they were crossed why it has its 
so a level of complexity from the biology standpoint as i understand it that is i know unique to 
it seems to be spread out wider with wine sc so these are just the basic facts that grapes 
in more varieties than wheat or barley do is an important part of it ml there just be one 
of wheat i wanna say that sure sc okay jo any good brewer is gonna like kill you for 
chuckle ml yeah someone in the comments is gonna destroy me chuckle but i think that part of when 
so in either hemisphere basically the band of thirty degrees and fifty degrees is the goldilocks zone as it 
of where you can successfully ripen vitis vinifera to have sugar levels compatible with fermentation below just getting baked 
although this is changing above struggling to have the physiological ripeness for the yeast to ferment and and nowhere 
makes wine that pretty laughter sc also nice ml it really is like any wine region you wanna go 
if not into it just go and eat there and hang out there it will be a good time 
i think that one of the things that gets in the way of people who are not wine experts 
that it is complicated right i mean this is the benefit this is the wonderful ml yeah sc but 
intimidating ml yes sc so besides red and white what are the basic ways in which we should classify 
wines in our heads like you know high alcohol low alcohol is an obvious one full bodied less full 
ml yeah sc what else is going on ml well so i do think about this in a binary 
and i think helpful for understanding especially if beginning so take red just for now you mentioned alcohol content 
definitely is a factor really more of a factor of climate and winemaker decision which get into but with 
wine the way i look at it the first fork in the road is is it thinskinned or is 
thickskinned sc okay ml so thinskinned varietals are pinot noir gamay grenache saintgervais tempranillo and nebbiolo those are the 
ones other like funky ones but those are the six main ones and then everything else is thick skinned 
cabernet sauvignon merlot petit verdot syrah etcetera sc and this is strictly a matter of what grape varietal it 
ml yes sc if you know the varietal then you know whether thick or thin ml yes grenache is 
funky one that people think is thin skinned but depending on where from it can seemingly wear both hats 
anyway so thin skin thick skin sc and how does that transform into a feature of the wine that 
ml thinskinned makes the lighter wine essentially thick skin will make a heavier wine another one of the weird 
grapes is nebbiolo the only one where basically i call like pinot noir wrapped in fine grit sandpaper tannic 
light usually the thickskinned grapes are gonna have more tannin structure but nebbiolo is this funky one amazing one 
kind of an outlier so thin skin thick skin and then the other really major thing to look at 
earth versus fruit and that is a function of where from and the wine world is roughly divided into 
quite halves but two parts the old world and the new world basically the old world is europe the 
world is everywhere not europe sc quite a eurocentric choice of language but okay ml yeah yeah and blanket 
wines from the old world are grown in a cooler climates wines from the new world are grown in 
climates so they tend to be riper and the riper grapes are getting the more fruit driven they tend 
be if the grapes getting as ripe they tend to reflect more of the surroundings of the vineyard the 
type and tasting more of the earth flavors a generalization exceptions to anything we could talk about here somewhere 
basically old world new world how it shakes out so the matrixes of is it light or heavy function 
the thickness of the skin is it more fruitdriven or more earthdriven within that you have the variables of 
the alcohol content will be and the other thing that plays into that or a function of all of 
is acidity versus tannin sc okay ml again the binary way i describe this is acid makes your mouth 
tannin dries your mouth out that is the easiest way to think about it sc oh very nice i 
that ml over steep a tea sc tannin ml and taste it tannin jo yes all done that ml 
just steep your tea yeah sc whereas lemon ml that is acid sc makes your mouth water yeah ml 
now in the context of wine i hesitate to call wines acidic it just sound great but aciddriven bright 
hightoned those kinda descriptors tend to be describing wines that have a higher level of acidity which makes them 
makes them more refreshing if you will sc would a chemist go along with this would they say that 
you are calling an acidic wine actually is more acidic versus basic in the ph scales ml yeah the 
level you measure it sc yeah objectively measurable ml yeah yeah i mean like a low ph wine if 
even aciddriven and then going up to jo a high ph ml over four yeah sc high more tannic 
ml no not necessarily different and they come together so they work together so the tannin level i know 
a way to really measure it from a chemistry standpoint like there is with ph but like as we 
into these wines we can talk about how they intermingle but basically acid and tannin you kinda taste them 
on top of each other and if you could magically take away the acid from the wine you would 
how much less spine it has called structure what acid and tannin imparts into wine sc but are two 
sort of properties that kind of do opposite things right so the tannic removes the moisture from your mouth 
the acid adds it but in principle you could have a wine that was both very tannic and very 
ml yes again nebbiolo it nebbiolo was raising its hand somewhere going me sc alright so had four things 
keep in mind ml yeah sc light versus heavy earthy versus fruity level of acidity level of tannicness tannin 
just level of tannin sc level of tannin okay good ml yeah and red grapes white you get to 
take out tannin so the juice of all grapes is clear the one thing the makes red wine red 
contact with the skins now there is called orange wine which is white wine made like a red wine 
in popularity a lot of funky bars are stuffed with orange wine jo right ml fine for foodpairing you 
a lot of them in croatia and part of europe but white you still have the acid you have 
tannin you still have body although it sort of manifests differently light white grapes sauvignon blanc all this is 
on how made so you can make a sauvignon blanc into a really rich like oaky style of wine 
you can not so a great varietal makeup with things like muscadet vermentino sauvignon blanc those are light zippy 
zesty white wines marsanne roussanne those are big oily fatter punchier styles of white wine viognier really oily also 
floral so white it kinda has a whole you need a different way of thinking about in describing white 
chardonnay is one of my favorite topics one of the most misunderstood things ever and this applies to all 
i have this conversation at the restaurant nightly ml are there things you like things you do not want 
because you like buttery and i always equate this to good will hunting not your fault not your fault 
not your fault sc people have been exposed to a lot of bad chardonnay right ml yeah not jo 
and i would also people also get exposed to a lot chablis i mean i had a lot of 
white chablis in college and turned me off white wine for a very long time ml yeah well a 
of that the california chablis as it was called jo oh my god ml that is not chablis that 
not from the appalachian origin contrôlée in the laughter northeastern part of sc i see ml not far from 
chablis is a place just like champagne is a place like you see old bottles of california wine that 
california sauterne california burgundy california sc the old days ml before the aocs were formed in one thousand nine 
thirtysix and you do that sc i we have this beautiful lovely wine in front of us and now 
have a little bit of a vocabulary for understanding it ml yeah sc but i know because we do 
a heterogeneous audience i want some takehome messages right away what should someone do if not a wine expert 
they kinda wanna be like they wanna investigate what are the steps they should take in a wine store 
restaurant or whatever to sort of get the basics and find something they like ml i would say find 
local wine shop get a couple of friends and be honest and go in on a few bottles that 
are in opposite styles and start down in what it is you do or do not like sc so 
wine shop you mean not supermarket ml i mean not supermarket yeah sc yeah ml not to you sc 
place where they know and like wine ml yes the money will almost always go farther you will have 
staff specifically trained to talk about and sell wine and also usually love wine minorly helpful chuckle sc so 
something light body get something full body get something earthy get something fruity ml exactly yeah and split them 
get what you might think might be too many glasses at the house but you never have enough sc 
you never do ml yeah and just start learning and pay attention to it which i mean that to 
sharp but think about what it is that tasting and think about how you would try to articulate it 
try to articulate it if you know what to say fine but make notes go back to that wine 
this is what i thought what do you think where do we go now i like that wine it 
dried all it took all the saliva out of my mouth what does that mean that chardonnay that i 
was gonna be oaky and buttery it was like razor blades what happened just be honest be inquisitive and 
really stress enough do it in a group do it with at least you jo one other person ml 
other person but just to bounce off each other and people are gonna pick out things that you notice 
vice versa and the rising tides right sc and it is possible to do okay at the twenty dollars 
level ml yes absolutely glad you brought that up i think there is somewhat of a break there just 
far as what it costs sc hard to do well at the ten dollars bottle ml yeah the exception 
in europe and you ask for the table wine and be sometimes like for a carafe and be awesome 
sometimes jo sometimes ml sometimes but your chances of it being awesome are way higher there than they are 
dealing with the tariffs and all that stuff but like you gotta be able to spend twenty dollars on 
bottle of wine and five drinks like would you complain at a bar if you were paying that for 
cocktail like twenty dollars bucks is where you reasonably should start and yeah there is no quality price ratio 
the wine world there are a lot of ways to waste money really fortunate to work where i do 
to taste a lot of crazy wines and a lot of them that are really expensive are absolutely worth 
if you could afford them and not feel it and a lot of them are just a waste of 
chuckle sc so just for the people who might never actually experience this themselves is there a difference between 
one thousand dollars bottle of wine and a ten thousand dollars bottle of wine ml it depends what they 
laughter sc but there can be ml oh yes yeah absolutely absolutely sc i mean it just seems i 
to a lot of people for whom a fifty dollars bottle of wine is ml totally yeah and it 
sc but the idea that once at a one thousand dollars but it is exactly but the idea might 
well be that at some point a point of diminishing return ml oh no paying for micro percentage increase 
that point and just paying for what it is i mean it is what it is like literally i 
the most famous winery in the world that tends to basically most of the most expensive bottles of wine 
the domaine de la romaneeconti in burgundy insanely good sc yeah ml sorry laughter like they are sc i 
in a physics analogy sort of land kind of like the large hadron collider ml okay yeah yeah sc 
very expensive is it worth literally a million times what what you can do for a one thousand dollars 
mmhmm sc no but if you spend the billions of dollars you get nothing ml do you find a 
boson without it sc yeah you find it at all right you find a of a higgs boson you 
nothing ml yeah yeah i love it sc so if you wanna find that at that level then what 
ml yeah and no drc is not whatever percentage it is better than whatever you wanna compare it to 
only one drc and a lot of things in the middle of that price range and things that are 
to the kinds of money you can spend on those kinda wines that are onedimensional and tasting the and 
ego chuckle ml not tasting this historically consistent place that is just renowned for a reason and everywhere across 
spectrum that exists i mean more and more and more of my favorite wines i call them the beautiful 
from the great producers in places like burgundy where a classification system of the vineyards where you have vineyards 
are classified as regional like from burgundy somewhere or then from a specific little village in burgundy and or 
a specific vineyard in burgundy and then from a really really good vineyard in burgundy the four different levels 
bourgogne the most simple of them from the great winemakers is a fraction of the price of the expensive 
but still getting that expertise in a simple wine and the golden place to be now some of those 
be sixty dollars to start but drinking sixty dollars wine from people who are making six hundred dollars seven 
dollars eight hundred dollars nine hundred dollars bottle of wine sc speaking of drinking ml drink wine sc now 
four different bottles of wine here and you have a theory a system for why four ml a reason 
sc explain the reason ml lot of reasons so all red sc red cause i said only red ml 
yes sc my overlapping conversation ml sean requested red fine no no episode two do all white laughter ml 
yeah i wanted to talk about the thin skin thick skin thing that i talked about and then also 
old world versus the new world so the only way to do that successfully is to have four wines 
excellent math skills chuckle ml from a physicist everyone heard that laughter ml so yeah i have a sonoma 
pinot noir versus a red burgundy so talked about burgundy couple of times but without explaining what that is 
that is a region in the central eastern part of france not far from the swiss border that makes 
noir and chardonnay couple other grapes they grow aligoté and gamay but for the most part pinot noir and 
and it and pretty much the greatest examples of them that is changing there is competition that is mounting 
the time but the competition is still bounced off burgundy just the reference point sc the standard ml yeah 
is sc okay so the california pinot noir ml yes sc and then the burgundy also pinot noir ml 
yeah if red and from burgundy pinot noir no blending everything here is just one varietal no blends the 
pinot noir is made by a winery named cobb and in the sonoma coast so the sonoma coast is 
big place like saying where do you chuckle okay kind of helpful but it could mean a lot of 
so sonoma coast but specifically the vineyards that ross cobb is working with are in this little undefined subregion 
the sonoma coast that working on getting passed through as an official subregion called freestoneoccidental just a few miles 
from the ocean meaning that the grapes are soaked in a marine layer a lot of the time ml 
also in these coastal regions you have really wide what are called diurnal shifts so the difference between the 
time of the day and the coolest time of the night and pretty much categorically across the wine world 
want that they want to be stressed they wanna be bouncing around temperaturewise but pinot noir specifically is kind 
a nightmare really finicky hard to grow grape requires perfect perfect conditions to not be either shrill if underripe 
flabby and sort of no longer a silky pretty sexy textured wine if getting too ripe so this specific 
pocket of the sonoma coast is great for it ross has a really in depth touch very handsoff wine 
as i call him and a great winemaker wanna taste what you can do with a wine i wanna 
the sc the wine right so i wanna actually taste this wine but let me just look forward a 
bit so that our audience knows where going these two the first ones are pinots old and new world 
the next two are ml second two are syrah so again california and sc be the thicker skin ml 
thick skin sc heavierbodied ml yeah fullerbodied especially the california iteration the french syrah really is not much heavier 
the red gonna be but which they do that on purpose a couple kind of almost backwards things in 
flight that i always like to illustrate that these wide brush strokes are not always accurate or there are 
to them i should say so two pinot noirs both from the two thousand fifteen vintage and then two 
both from the two thousand ten vintage two thousand fifteen in california coming out of drought string of drought 
warm but not really warm not to the level of and then in france is really really widely acclaimed 
little bit of a riper rounder vintage sc ml yeah yeah but the yields are down as been in 
for the past basically ten vintages in a row which get into later why happening but basically the california 
noir which typically again broad stroke california versus france gonna get a more fruitdriven heavier style of wine from 
warmer climate and then the european wines typically are more earthdriven and more rustic and here kind of backwards 
of them is necessarily rustic but the burgundy is a little bit more svelte and kinda slick due to 
warmer vintage and different wine making styles between them but both master master winemakers the burgundy is from a 
named bruno clair from a specific little village in burgundy called savignylèsbeaune and then one vineyard called la dominode 
dominode was planted in so the oldest vines in this vineyard date back to then and basically as vines 
older they produce less juice so the juice they do produce is more concentrated tends to give you a 
complex wine tends to give you more ageworthy wine sc literally the same vine like you take a snip 
a vine and plant that ml replant you can do that a point where some of them stop producing 
so always less and less and less and less of the old vines and replanting other parts of the 
so not every vine in this is from sc the arrow of time at work i ml there it 
sc we think of individual animals as having a lifespan but you really think of plants as having a 
ml they have a lifespan yeah yeah sc but they do yeah they give up at some point anyway 
taste sc the new world okay good so this is the california pinot noir jo the cobb ml the 
ricespivak vineyard sonoma coast pinot noir sc and what should we be looking for when tasting this ml what 
do is i always smell first and it first it sounds obvious but a lot of people a lot 
people just go into the glass and just go right in but obviously our sense of taste and sense 
smell are linked and part of especially when dealing with pinot noir i mean just it is lacy pretty 
floral ml understated floral exactly i wanna smell all that and this wine smells gorgeous and more and jo 
it right now ml yeah chuckle yeah that you know and this i always get kinda like pomegranate like 
again that racy high tone bright acidity that see on the end you feel it in your tongue you 
it everywhere really but the way that the finish sings and keeps going that is why you need wine 
has a fair amount of acidity in it if you have that you just get the same level of 
of width and breadth and depth jo yeah actually very surprised this is a sean knows that i like 
wines i like super super fruity wines and i feel the acidity here that makes this so pleasurable and 
drinkable it actually allows those lighter floral notes to come out and it kind of softens the fruit component 
little bit ml yeah yeah i mean you just have a really really integrated wine and for it to 
integrated this well this young this wine even technically released yet this really adamant about holding the wines back 
three four years longer than most wineries do just cause he wants them to hit when killing it not 
this jo but gonna age and in a couple years gonna be perfect ml be better i mean this 
this is an amazing wine ml this is a wine easily easily and the other thing here that i 
is the salinity and another thing a common thread through the wines that i love is here coming from 
i said that marine layer imagine it like eating a perfect dish at a great restaurant just nothing tastes 
mean that not salt in it if you could take it sc an enhancer right ml you would notice 
so i think of wine musically and bass middle treble on an equalizer so acidity is kind of likens 
the treble if listening to a record and you turn all the treble off you hear it no definition 
precision is gone jo all about that bass no treble is not good for wine chuckle ml yeah this 
a great example of a perfect high end in a great record sc when you say something like pomegranate 
i would not have said that but when you say it i can sort of recognize it after the 
ml see what happens sc do you think laughter sc so a psychology experiment going on also but do 
think that there are literally molecules that would be in a pomegranate that are also in here ml yes 
are when we get to the syrah talk about rotundone so the thing that makes black pepper black pepper 
oh ml syrah if it smell like black pepper it got messed up somewhere sc and presumably there is 
scientific research going on trying to deconstruct a wine like this and try to make try to make us 
why it tastes the way it does ml slash recreate it in a petri dish yes sc yes but 
i mean not successful we can make an impossible burger but we cannot make fake wine yet ml coming 
coming yeah ml i mean as you know atoms nothin else it is reducible period sc there is the 
a finite number of arrangements ml as much as i oh man yeah me and friends have talked about 
a lot over a lot of bottles of wine and the moral conundrums of a sommelier yeah sc i 
imagine you could tune whatever wine you wanted that would be kind of awesome ml oh imagined it sc 
ml yeah jo the chemistry is very very complicated but there is in fact a lot of ongoing research 
ml yeah jo uc davis for example but other places around the world are very much looking at the 
composition of these for just that reason the better you understand the chemical components and going on in the 
not just in space but over time the more you can tailor the flavor profiles to your liking ml 
and the more learn about if not making wine in a petri dish the more you could better farm 
mean wine is farminggardening however you wanna look at it but somewhere in the middle of those things and 
doing has an impact all prior causes everything all happening in a vineyard and at the end of the 
you can only make great wine from great grapes you can go the other way you can mess it 
but you just take subpar lazily farmed lifeless grapes and turn them into a complex head spinning beverage it 
work that way so a lot of reasons why that happens there are variables that we do know about 
vine age is a big one i mentioned that with the burgundy of the old vines they make less 
they tend to just have a wine a little bit more concentrated and i look at the structure of 
wine again like i mentioned which is acid and tannin and then vine age plays into that as like 
charging of the batteries of the wine like how long will the charge last essentially sc you mean over 
not over since you opened the bottle and started drinking it ml well both we can talk about that 
more talking about in the bottle but good wine can take way more oxygen than people realize i mean 
have a couple litmus tests for how much i really like a wine and one of them is how 
it on day three some wine some styles of wine are absolutely better on day three in pairings at 
restaurant open wines on my way out the door for the next night kind of thing jo and some 
vinegar after day three ml yeah exactly that has to do with structure and then also the aging of 
wine in the bottle wine that lasts a hundred years there has to be if talking reds some level 
tannin in there some level of acidity the grapes have to have structure which i equate to our skeleton 
mean a reason we can sit in these chairs and walk around and that is the equivalent of that 
wine is the intermingling of acid and tannin jo the oldest wine ever had ml well i have two 
to that one of them is madeira so fortified wine from the overlapping conversation ml cheating because it go 
from late i forget the vintage on it jo late what chuckle ml sc eighteenth century ml yeah it 
a lot of the economy early on sc older than america ml yeah jo like with thomas wine correct 
yeah the fake wine jo the fake wine ml got a couple of those too chuckle sc a whole 
okay but nonfortified ml nonfortified late one thousand eight hundred vintages bordeaux like hautbrion from sc are they holding 
ml yeah got twenty minutes at most sc gotta overlapping conversation ml you know tasting like two ounces if 
an ounce here and there and there and that dries out really quick in the glass sc sorry but 
important lesson right a lot people think the older the wine is the more you have to decant it 
let it air out and that a point of diminishing returns there ml definitely so yeah oxygen helps till 
hurts all the way across the spectrum so if you have what are called good or great vintages and 
dislike the way of describing them which we can talk about later because you have to say what for 
or bad for what poor vintages when they come out that are better to drink young and then usually 
well young because very primary and meant to go the distance like the energizer bunny style down the road 
meant to be drunk but in those ripe those wines take longer to unpack so if going to open 
young decanting them is helpful i decant more white wine than i do red at this point and i 
a lot people misunderstand white can handle way more oxygen than most people give it and i am a 
fan at this point of just letting red wine slow slow ox as they call it slowly come up 
the glass rather than trying to fast forward it sc so we enjoy how it changes over the course 
the meal ml yeah exactly and part of that is pretty ocd about not crossing pours as i call 
so especially if dealing with an older wine you pour two to three ounces never more than that take 
you never want six ounces of wine in a glass if you can unless just ordering wine by the 
sc good tip yeah ml it is just not helpful you get less out of it in the long 
jo interesting because of course america kind of like wanna get our ml oh sure yeah i get it 
and this is a very different kind of aesthetic where to get your worth means you want the wine 
be as good as possible ml yeah jo and not a quantity question ml yeah basically i want roughly 
ounces of wine in a bottle to turn into as many wines as i can possibly let it turn 
so if dealing that happens more usually with older wines but if pouring two people two ounces they get 
wines if playing along and also how the empty glass smells is a beautiful thing and that actually is 
with young wine if had maybe too much oak put on it or a little bit too much treatment 
what you smell in the glass i call it the finish of the nose so people talk about the 
and the finish of the palate and just but not technically finish of the nose but i think of 
that way like what are the remnants all about sc okay so enjoyed ml yeah sc two thousand fifteen 
pinot i mean this is a highlevel one relatively speaking but this is more fruity than earthy because it 
newer ml more fruit driven that earth yes sc very acidic bright light on the palate and now moving 
the old world ml yes to the bruno clair and i lead the witness have you taste it sc 
gonna taste it and who knows what could happen anything really chuckle ml at mindscape the wine edition jo 
very different ml six thousand five hundred miles jo well but more in the way they handle the acidity 
think because here the acidity is very front and center and very very pronounced and here more blended and 
and a little more gentle ml bam yep yep a relatively warm vintage in a place that have a 
of them and definitely to do with the fact dealing with an old vineyard sc so this is the 
where the actual vines are from ml part of them yeah a block i forget exactly what the split 
but one thousand nine hundred eight planting plantings in the usually if vines in this part of the world 
under twenty years old not sell it overlapping conversation sc is this a wine that will age more than 
first one ml hard to not say yes laughter ml although i sc we wanna say anything against the 
one ml no i and not sc awesome jo but the first one is a lovely wine ml yeah 
surprised that both i would have and if i did not know would think that the second was older 
right the first one tastes like an excellent ml yeah jo yes sc the second one tastes older right 
out ml yeah jo absolutely i would drink this with a meal ml totally yeah jo wonderful but just 
a little the edge is off i guess is the best way i can think of it ml sure 
a good way to put it yeah and so you can sort of put wine into three timelines of 
secondary tertiary as far as their lifespans go and roughly take the bruno clair i say primary is probably 
they say in the first ten years of burgundy you taste the winemaker and then after that you start 
taste the terroir the t word the infamous word laughter ml so say ten to fifteen years is primary 
fifteen to twentyfive is secondary and then once past twentyfive or in the tertiary and shedding fruit flavors as 
go and exchanging them for earthy soil tea sc spicy overlapping conversation ml spice yeah and like leather in 
would say even old library like the easiest way to sc musty jo speaking my language ml yeah laughter 
as sean can tell you i love these older leathery smoky wine ml oh amazing and okay so to 
back on what makes wine different about it the time capsule of it i sc yeah ml when drinking 
vintage it is think about going on in the world at that time mindblowing and just cool that you 
do these parallels to draw and a whole other conversation piece and it need to be old not jo 
ml not alienating young wines jo those notes can be there in the young wines for sure ml yeah 
is from when fill in the blank or this or you remember that time definitely a factor in wine 
so the first seems noticeably more acidic to me neither one of them seems especially tannic or am i 
something ml yeah so so thank you for saying that so these tannic pinot noir a tannic grape if 
had a pinot noir that was tannic it would be from oak tannins so new oak barrels can impart 
own tannins which are different than grape tannins and these wines are both made from wine that do that 
i think pinot noir really want to be made that way typically sc so wine is generally aged in 
but some of new some of old is that what it is ml yes you can use cement you 
use stainless and then in oak french american slovenian hungarian yeah everything on the table is french when we 
to the côterôtie they use barrels that are about three times the size of the barrels that every other 
here is using which are two hundred twentyfive liter if you just think of a wine barrel the first 
that comes to your mind two hundred twentyfive liters and the bigger you go the less surface contact with 
wine so the less oak is imparted and i think both of these are actually pretty similar about a 
new oak each the bruno clair might be and then the rest of the oak being used has already 
used one other time so not like old old oak some of these cellars man in france like yeah 
they have coopers they employ just they do not want new barrels and you walk into these places and 
why bruno clair smells the way it does in bruno clair smelling and like yeah the mold on the 
is from every fermentation happened in sc yeah ml yeah sc alright move on to our syrahs ml okay 
the next wine is from favia wines so this is a husband and wife team two really really acclaimed 
makers in california annie favia is the viticulturist so doing all the work in the vineyard married to andy 
the winemaker and if you combined their resumes basically every top culty hardtoget cabernet sauvignon predominately out of the 
valley they have friends that own this vineyard in amador county not far from where i grew up and 
make it in napa and this is a really good example of a fairly fullthrottle fullerbodied style of california 
that go over the top jumped up in alcohol content here the first two wines were about now at 
in thick skin varietal with syrah sc like a completely different beverage really ml no it really is yeah 
this is even i would be able to say yes this is a california right away ml but see 
lift still persistence energy it just go away and that is really the structure what i want in wine 
keeps you coming back to the glass it makes it infinitely easier to pair with food if wine have 
food pairings become jo right ml or just not possible at a high level jo right getting a very 
like olivey note and ml yeah jo a prunish note here ml okay yeah so think of what a 
is jo yeah ml think of the ripeness level jo right ml dealing with riper fruit here and olive 
see that in syrah often i know the name of that compound sean sorry sc neither do i a 
physicist ml okay laughter jo not overpowering but very noticeable ml in there jo very prominent ml yeah jo 
the most prominent note for me ml mmhmm i always like saying remember you said when we get to 
jamet the côterôtie which i find olive in too in a different way in i would say a more 
way sc well even though this is a high alcohol wine relatively speaking you get that burning that you 
in the cheap high alcohol wine ml still balanced still balanced and still young this is i know if 
said that both the syrahs are this ties in to how wine ages but i explained the alcohol is 
gonna change everything else in the wine can shed and change and evolve and congeal and whatever but you 
have this pillar in the middle sc so sorry like unless your bottle is not corked correctly or whatever 
literal amount of alcohol in the bottle never changes not the chemical reaction that happens ml yeah it sc 
other reactions going ml this is ethanol there for the long haul and that if the out of balance 
becomes more obvious the older they get you see this a lot this really acclaimed vintage of the napa 
the wineries dealt with huge yields from the vineyards larger than they could physically handle so they had to 
half the fruits start dealing with it while the other half is in the vineyard getting too ripe and 
bring in the other half and it got just rock star scores left and right just dealing out scores 
now most of them do not show well and you put your nose in the glass and like porty 
child prodigies ml yeah so that never changes and then when you have lower alcohol wines just more seamless 
if more seamless when the you wanna be seamless all the way through right so you notice it and 
a young wine high alcohol better young i just categorically disagree when i look at these drinking windows of 
of these big massive wines like age thirtyfive i it will physically be drinkable but i want what it 
taste like then jo it might not be as enjoyable right ml if you dig that just dig it 
it but i think better young sc so for our nonexpert listeners the best wines in the world like 
classic bordeauxs burgundies or whatever what alcohol level have they traditionally been at ml i say is a good 
basically if below the grapes just not enough energy not enough food for the yeast to ferment into alcohol 
also a sweet spot that you have to meet ml a sweet spot definitely now you i should say 
this is for dry wines most wines produced in the world are dry if you sc dry meaning low 
ml yes yes and no called residual sugar so leftover sugar from the fermentation rieslings from germany in the 
that are that are delicious but sweetness also acidity to balance it out deceptively not sweet when you drink 
lot of them so those are outside of what talking about if fermenting a wine to dryness basically gotta 
or else gonna just be razor blades and then once you get over say or even in the depending 
what the style of the wine is where it starts to be noticeable and i start to get off 
train a place a subregion in provence called bandol whose wines i love and they just overlook right on 
mediterranean and back to the diurnal shift huge diurnal shift ml so a warm part of france but then 
the sea so they come way down in temperature and those wines can be all day and never notice 
just the integration that they have but yeah like i said the two burgundies drinking are the lowest alcohol 
gonna be the fourth wine the domaine jamet côterôtie which is but you look at old bordeaux and even 
old napa cabs from the golden era of when napa was starting to blow up late to the and 
those are alcohol cabernets and they age incredibly well sc yeah ml some of my favorite wines and then 
some of those same producers a lot of them are in different hands but making sc but there was 
jo that seems high ml high sc yeah ml in claiming that they have wiggle room too they can 
about jo oh okay ml to a degree they can be like sc and there was a thing not 
long ago for big alcohol bomb wines like zinfandels and cabs from california would be very highalcohol and probably 
the american palate is not that sophisticated and they like their booze ml yeah so a lot of geopolitical 
going on in the maybe not the right descriptor but a lot of outside factors with that and i 
critics are a big part of this just impossible to not talk about it and basically when you see 
alcohol levels go up and take napa is a really good example of it like i just said late 
in the they started irrigating so everything was dry farmed before then and like in most of europe illegal 
irrigate jo oh ml so the sc if making wine ml yeah yeah sc considered cheating ml basically sc 
alright ml yeah sc no cheating ml and it raises the yield so basically the lower the yield typically 
more concentrated the wine typically the more complex the wine and therefore the the higher the yields the more 
typically the flavors are gonna be so in the they start irrigating and then right after that something called 
hit napa which hit the whole wine world basically in europe in the wiped out the vineyards in europe 
so a disease ml yeah a little microscopic pest that dehydrates the roots and yeah this is interesting so 
rootstock is impervious to it but it was introduced into france from jo oh ml or was brought over 
it traveled with the roots and but impervious to it so of the vineyards in europe are planted onto 
root stock jo okay ml and that happened in the phylloxera hit it took them sixty years to figure 
how to fix it in that time a lot of the vineyards got poisoned actually part of why you 
a lot of organic and biodynamic viticulture happening now is undoing what happened then jo how interesting ml yeah 
macrofarming stuff so that happened in napa this specific kind of rootstock that was susceptible to it that funny 
uc davis recommended everyone use and then before they knew that phylloxera loved it sorry chuckle sc science is 
sometimes ml yeah yeah learning learning so you have irrigation then phylloxera so basically a reset button happens and 
vineyards get replanted so now you have young vines and going into the early into the this is when 
cult cabernet thing happens this is when scores are becoming more and more of a thing spectator robert parker 
that and not that that exist before but really more into the mainstream getting into the dot com boom 
money coming into this part of the world that there before to that level and people wanting to own 
winery and you the way a lot of these tastings happen where doing the scores is tasting one hundred 
in a row so the only things that pop and get high scores are big highalcohol wines just physiologically 
you go to and it created this thing that i refer i correlate it to the loudness wars which 
something that happened in the music industry really in the same time which is interesting where basically just as 
sort of wired to think that louder is better sc it is obviously ml yeah obviously it is yeah 
sc so you want your song to be the loudest right ml yes exactly like this song is and 
nope here you go oh nope here you chuckle sc louder ml and also crushing the dynamics out and 
the nuance out so you get something from nothing you are paying for it in one way or another 
the same thing is totally apt corollary to wine the bigger the bigger the bigger the bigger is not 
and you see the pendulum is definitely evening out i was just up in napa a month ago and 
a lot of the up there and really pretty and tasted some tasted some out of barrel and i 
that things being reeled in definitely sc probably a whole another podcast episode about the relationship of aesthetics and 
happening on different levels different scales right ml yeah sc like the human mind and eye and palate apparently 
attracted to complications in all these ways ml yeah sc the simplicity gets us first but then we wanna 
something a little bit more interesting ml the rabbit hole yeah yeah sc yeah ml yeah sc okay so 
one see this is the california syrah ml yep this is the favia sc clearly ml yeah sc than 
pinots both of them ml well it is also heavier taking a big step in body yeah a concentration 
sc certainly heavier bodied jo i call it fruitier per se i mean the pinots have a little floral 
to ml yeah jo which i think offsets the fruit so maybe it ml mmhmm sc it seem especially 
acidic or tannic to me ml yeah sc california syrah ml again these are all balanced wines at the 
of the day so like poking out totally what going for jo but less acidity ml so i would 
that it is actually pretty similar level of acidity okay same amount of treble but more bass jo right 
you go ml so if again you take out the treble you would notice it this is same thing 
touched on with german riesling some of them can have sugar levels that would shock you but you still 
still pucker at the end of tasting it because acid to balance it out jo right ml so it 
certainly the ph is probably higher than the cabs or the cab and the bruno clair just more oomph 
it sc alright and ml and we should sc our ml so go into the jamet so this is 
one of my favorite wines that exists domaine jamet côterôtie a syrah from the northern rhone southern part of 
the rhone is split into two parts i call them halves the northern really only like the top of 
valley but these vineyards are planted on these really steep precipitous terraced slopes that the romans did a lot 
the terracing and been keeping it up since then and you have this fairly windy place so a fair 
south from where burgundy is which you think be warmer and a little bit warmer but only a couple 
degrees celsius so you have winds blowing through here which cool down the grapes and any time you have 
in the direct vicinity of vineyards especially when the vineyards around the water are on steep slopes it acts 
a solar panel so bouncing sunlight back into the vineyard so you get a level of ripeness without the 
that you think would be necessary the best way heard it explained is this burgundian winemaker he said that 
sun ripens the grapes not the heat sc yeah ml and bam sc not sure if scientifically accurate but 
get it ml yeah getting the point across of like the things that are making up this wine and 
ripening process it does not need to be hot nor should it be and this wine especially on the 
nothing else smells like jamet it has this like peppered beef sc pepper is the thing i ml yeah 
the rotundone this is what i was talking about was the rotundone jo the smell is amazing sc rotundone 
a chemical ml compound flavor compound in black pepper jo an odorant essentially ml yeah jamet is just lights 
and it ml and floral and pepper sc literally is in pepper as well as in this wine ml 
sc metaphorical ml the other big compound that gets thrown around is pyrazine in bell peppers and jalapeños and 
in sauvignon blanc and you see it often in new zealand sauvignon blanc notorious for it you other than 
sometimes like cat piss which it is famous for chuckle not just talking down on it a sc overlapping 
ml a phrase in common usage you can use that in wine scrabble yeah laughter ml but a bell 
jalapeño thing oftentimes in that and especially you see it there sauvignon blanc also makes up sancerre in france 
something about the way that sancerre when it grows in the soil types in the loire produce it in 
high level so in the sommelier exams when blind tasting sauvignon blanc just praying for a marlborough new zealand 
blanc like it jo yeah ml but yeah jo so interesting i mentioned the strong olive note and a 
olive note here but i feel like not overpowering in the same way getting kind of a leathery and 
smoky kinda finish here in addition to the pepper and i think it kind of balances out the olive 
not as overpowering ml yeah i would the way i would articulate that is i love favia i meant 
say that favia quarzo syrah that is literally the wine that got me into wine i had a buddy 
convinced me to part with forty dollars eleven years ago that i had to think about for two days 
the time chuckle and now sitting here recording a podcast with you so that is sc come a long 
ml yeah a good investment but that is the wine that started it all and then jamet is the 
that got me into french wine about syrah so hard for me to say not my favorite grape i 
jo a subjective element here right ml of course yeah jo because sean can tell you very sensitive to 
like olive an amarone that i find absolutely undrinkable because like an olive punch to the face ml yeah 
but if you balance it out a wonderful note ml right say that in the favia the olive is 
one of three or four things that you smell in the jamet if i sit here for ten minutes 
or twelve things i could probably pull out of this so in there but just integrated jo diluted ml 
jo or integrated i think is a better word ml what i love other côterôties have this jamet i 
has it in spades is that also floral so it sort of calls back the pinots and the weight 
is not much heavier than pinots and again mentioned it that this is the lowest alcohol this is sc 
you guess ml no i know funny i think about it because i guess if drinking balanced wines not 
about it sc all great and i wanna say anything against any of them but getting the feeling that 
old world wines are a teensy bit more sophisticated and structured than the new world wines ml yeah i 
more going on per sip in my experience ml right so i think about this a lot in doing 
i do and having this conversation in two thousand nineteen and dealing with roughly chasm of experience difference in 
versus say california in this case but at the same time in a way not really i talked about 
there have been these reset buttons that happen and the first winery in yeah first winery in napa i 
if the first winery in california it had to be one of them charles krug sc a while ago 
ml a while ago and then you have prohibition you have a couple of world wars to deal with 
have the depression you have these setbacks that happened in california wine and then not until the with the 
the wine world infamous judgement of paris which i could touch on really quick just to give you some 
where there was a tasting organized in one thousand nine hundred seventysix where basically the top bordeaux producers were 
of pitted against this handpicked lineup of california cabernet producers mainly napa but one from santa cruz mountains and 
won sc yay california ml yay california chuckle jo woohoo ml now what you tell you is that france 
lazy at this point and california is hungry so these other factors not as easy as sc ml yeah 
like i mentioned with the phylloxera thing france is reeling from that dealing with that so those vines that 
wines were made from the french wines in the judgement of paris those are all really young vines yeah 
and hautbrion but in this dodgy era of french viticulture when you have california just trying to kill it 
that hunger factor is huge so i agree with you although super important to not just talk down on 
new world not saying you are sc no it is and in ml i love it sc i think 
of the things that is very clear is how much fun it is and how enlightening it is to 
wines like this next to each other ml see yes huge yeah first thing i walked in many wine 
do we have we all need to have four we sc turns out we have enough chuckle ml yeah 
have enough see you can never have too many yeah the context is huge just being able to go 
back and forth between them not have one and then taste this okay dump it or spit or not 
whatever now another not the most educational way to drink wine and that is really what passionate about among 
parts of wine service is that look this stuff is really cool fascinating and some people mess that up 
but a lot going on and there is a wine out there for everyone absolutely people say drink wine 
like wine well go in on that jo interesting i used to be one of those people that said 
like i was never a big drinker and then i realized it was just that i was drinking really 
wine ml yeah sc out there you can get it jo also i wanna touch on this on the 
because picked very different shaped glasses and people see them but we have sort of rounder more bowllike glasses 
the pinots and more the sc the narrower jo the narrower wine glasses and why is that and why 
it important ml the glassware kinda gotten crazy riedel now makes an oregon pinot noir glass a california pinot 
glass a red burgundy glass jo they have to make money chuckle ml i sc i want them all 
i get it i want them all but the answer standard answer is with the back to thin skin 
more delicate styles of wine you typically wanna put in a bulb because that bulbous shape helps contain the 
versus a bordeaux glass basically like burgundy or bordeaux glass the bordeaux glasses kind of funnel out more powerful 
so they kind of emphasize them more roughly the way it breaks down i definitely use different kinds of 
you see more and more companies just making the one glass i think there literally is a company that 
is the name laughter where just like wine should go in this and i necessarily disagree with that kinda 
in the middle ml i think i could definitely run a whole wine program on three glasses just one 
like a smaller version of the bordeaux glass for bright clean crisp zippy white wines i would use this 
same glass that we have the pinot noirs in for chardonnays whether rich and toasty or mineral and clean 
marsanne roussanne those bigger whites and i also use these for champagne a huge thing if i have to 
ask me like your favorite wine i hard not to say champagne chuckle sc but this sounds like sacrilege 
put champagne in a in a burgundy glass jo yeah you supposed to either use the flute or the 
antoinette glass ml yeah i vehemently disagree with both of the two most popular champagne glass choices the flute 
you see the bubbles and cool sc if what into yeah jo visually striking ml yeah and then the 
has the legend hard to divorce from it the coupe is a great martini glass i would say sc 
you say the legend out loud supposed to be based on the shape of marie breasts ml yes sc 
ml i dig it i like it as a martini glass sc this is a grownup podcast ml yeah 
no a great glass shape but it gives all the bubbles away right ml so talk about that so 
bubbles going anywhere just you see them so champagne is a wine that is also sparkling but it is 
wine first and foremost also logistically either the hardest or maybe the second hardest however you wanna view dry 
production but basically a nightmare to make in a really precipitous climate becoming less and less so the grapes 
use predominately are chardonnay pinot noir and pinot meunier those are the burgundian varietals so to me champagne goes 
a burgundy glass i wanna smell it again the nose is maybe not everything but at this point for 
i could just smell all these for a couple hours and be all good and great i think a 
of champagne is not enjoyed to the level it could be enjoyed solely to due to the glassware and 
people serve it way too cold we can talk about serving temperatures jo actually a very good point ml 
so most people serve whites too cold and reds too warm sc we definitely had a lifestyle upgrade when 
got a little refrigerator for our red wine ml bam lifestyle upgrade yeah sc because they meant to be 
in dank cold french cellars ml yeah which is the average is around jo and in california ml yeah 
jo it never gets that cold here ml so what goes along with that storage temperature and service temperature 
two different things storage the caves in champagne and the caves in burgundy and the caves in bordeaux sure 
difference but at the end of the day call it fiftythree to typically you see lighter brighter cleaner white 
served cooler and then richer white wines served warmer the charts you see especially in the sommelier exams when 
get grilled like the proper serving at this point i would just fail all that because be chuckle sc 
ml well care because to me if balanced if bright if complete then i can drink it i can 
champagne at fiftyfive and get way more of a nose off it and taste it more like a wine 
the people that are drinking it when they put it in their fridge which is legally has to hold 
which is jo to me a great example of like mastering the rules so you know how to break 
ml love it thank you thank you jennifer laughter take that with me i love it yeah i i 
to enjoy each wine as best i can and you can mess with temperature and if there is take 
hot alcoholwise red wine if i put it in a decanter and spin it in an ice bucket for 
minutes and then pour it you will notice less of the ethanol tricks that temperature can be used to 
wines along especially in a foodpairing restaurant setting sc wait going through your mind when you do that foodpairing 
setting so you are working at a restaurant as you already said a sommelier should do i think that 
of the intimidation factor with a lot of people is feeling like they need to know which wines go 
which foods and they jo and they have a vocabulary to articulate what they want ml yeah so touch 
that real quick and then go right into pairing about the vocabulary so we were talking earlier how should 
get started and i recommended to go to a shop get some friends put it up talk about it 
be honest i would say the goal is to be able to go to a restaurant and say to 
waiter bartender sommelier whatever yeah we would like a clean crisp dry mineraldriven white wine and a medium body 
red wine that have too harsh of a tannin level could you help us with that is a you 
killing it you are killing it sc this is what the sommeliers want to hear chuckle jo most of 
do not speak that language ml yeah and not that far away to be able like maybe three trips 
a couple of friends to a wine shop you could get at least half of each of those sentences 
successfully and that helps everybody and you it will only help sc right ml right at the end of 
jo well you have to figure out what you like it took me a couple of years to figure 
that i could go into a restaurant and say want like a medium to fullbodied red not too fruity 
a little on the older side not too young and i want kind of these leathery smoky long finish 
of ml like percentile right there and that is killing it jo and not an expert but i basically 
a vocabulary i need to learn to communicate with my ml exactly so yeah not knowing how to say 
a lot actually well this just came to me when asking about the food and wine pairing thing a 
way to learn if you go to a restaurant and they offer a wine pairing do the wine pairing 
yeah ml make let someone i always call it the wanna think about option jo and take an uber 
be really plastered chuckle ml yeah yeah sc take a lyft uber is evil but okay ml yeah especially 
coming to melisse laughter sc or if in the airport go to the vino volo and get a flight 
different ml done yeah sc taste them right ml totally much rather have three twoounce pours than one sixounce 
jo so what do you look at when looking at pairings because difficult ml yeah a whole episode but 
say the number one thing i like to explain to people is that the protein necessarily drive oftentimes the 
thing i look at jo so not a white wine with fish and chicken and red wine with meat 
ml sc what been taught ml yeah well not untrue just like good exceptions to that like the fish 
like salmon is always the blaring example i always describe salmon a ribeye that chuckle got fat content and 
cooked properly medium at most even medium rare sc raw pretty raw ml yeah there it is okay so 
in champagne or dry riesling at a sushi bar and pinot noir to take a that i get with 
a couple of exceptions is pinot noir and salmon got really popular and it theoretically i get it you 
a lighter usually brighter red wine with the richest of the fishes shall we say but pinot even when 
burgundy and even older still a fair amount of fruit to it and fruit and fat butt sc i 
think you want acid right ml you want acid but i want tannin i wanna i like the gritty 
you tasted it on its own maybe your gone like is dry man i know if i dig but 
you have the salmon and bam overlapping conversation sc with the ml yeah the ribeye or the ribeye of 
sea it works really well one example of it i look at limiting factors is it spicy for real 
actual heat the bandwidth gets pretty narrow as to what you can use and you want sugar to counterbalance 
you also refresh the food that way for the most part dealing with pairings on long at least four 
but sometimes seven or so trying to keep your palate alive the whole time taught that you go sparkling 
light white into rich white into light red into medium red into heavy red into dessert and then done 
i agree because by the time twothirds of the way through the trajectory physically tapping out sc exhausted yeah 
and affecting how the food tastes not just what does the food taste like what does the wine taste 
you should be able to go to a great restaurant and have a menu like that if you drink 
and be happy theoretically you should be able to sit down at a table and just have ten wines 
a row and be happy and then when the two come together and when the food is no more 
ever of the equation and the wine is no more ever than of the equation and everything is killing 
the optimal situation so start with a light white or a champagne maybe to start off and then go 
into an offdry wine if the course merits it i like going right into a red wine at the 
and then right back to a white then if using aciddriven wines which i typically am that cleans the 
wine out of your palate on the menu oftentimes at melisse i look at it like two fivecourses backtoback 
have champagne in the middle so just trying sc this is a good sales pitch from melisse right here 
ml the philosophy of how to bounce around and people expect it again i wanna think about an the 
are high important to be able to do the pairing thing well so like how i try to structure 
menus but a few things like beef take beef especially since we have two syrahs in front of us 
is beef this is definitive jo this meaning ml the two syrahs jo okay sc what is it about 
syrah that makes it good with beef ml well just smell it that especially the jamet like an animalistic 
thing to jamet and what you see all the time is steak and cab steak and cab and cool 
i kinda preach the syrah gospel a lot of the time i think that that is a lot of 
sc syrah seems to comes to me as more ml yeah sc than the cabernet overall ml typically and 
for it to get out of the wine hands with ripeness sc becomes unbalanced ml yeah yeah and then 
wines stop being food friendly right so things that are still bright and not a big heavy cakey oily 
of syrah but that with beef is great fun chicken is kinda like the coin flip i literally just 
white and red side by side white burgundy red burgundy have fun it depends on is the skin on 
it herbed or are there truffles involved talking obviously the context of this is fortunate to work in a 
restaurant it does pizza and burgers either the great wines of the world or entry level wines that is 
great sport a really fun thing sc is there anything specific i should have in mind if i know 
the nice pepperoni pizza allowed to have wine i know that done it ml definitely sc what should i 
for obviously sort of fatty ml yeah well this kind of cheesy saying no pun intended with that of 
it grows with it it goes with it you hear so sc okay ml why barolo and the piemontese 
became popular from the same place so medium body but still bright fairly earthdriven but still fruit to glue 
together that works well with that kind of pizza good white burgundy and a good burger i love i 
i use more whites than reds with paring which i sc i can imagine a not done it but 
can imagine a good white burgundy with a burger would go well ml cheeseburger sc cheeseburger ml yeah cheese 
a lot of people do cheese and red and only a couple of times it works to me cheese 
a white jo interesting ml part of the meal to me and especially some sweet wines if they are 
like harder styles with really suckyouin juicy bright red wines are fun also a cool application for the funky 
wine thing like i mentioned yeah cheese is a when we say cheese that is like jo a lot 
cheeses ml sc like wine ml yeah exactly yeah jo some cheeses that go beautifully with reds ml yeah 
yeah i guess trying to refresh always i like when things go up when the treble is there jo 
a couple of years ago i did a piece for gizmodo where we did a girl scout cookie and 
pairing ml awesome jo they actually have worked this out ml oh i wanna do that jo and it 
was a lot of fun and sc it was educational jo it was extremely educational it works less well 
halloween candy i recommend it too much sugar ml oh candy corn dough with jo with white wine or 
wines go very well we found with a short bread or a fruit we found that a very plummy 
went great with a peanut butter cookie like eating the peanut butter and jelly sandwich ml okay jo but 
thing is the thin mints so those girl scout cookie thin mints go with anything they paired it with 
amarone which was dreadful ml was it that jo that oliveladen heavy ml yeah jo very sugary i like 
sean does ml with you i apologize to anyone listening jo i think a palate difference wine is very 
and for me amarone is like a that olive punch to the face and combine that with a thin 
which i normally love and it was just like kungfu fighting in the mouth ml yeah i was gonna 
that it sounds like wrestling yeah the pairing wrestle sc part of loving what you love is something you 
love overlapping conversation jo is there anything that goes with mint chuckle in the ml i was gonna say 
although i said it with candy corn that would probably work like chocolate right jo yeah ml yeah so 
specifically tawny port or old madeira jo but the mint seems to be what makes it hard to pair 
well i would wanna wanna play acid off mint you could that might be a man i can we 
this i a were they was anything sweet that you used or was it all dry wines jo no 
use any dessert wines they were mostly dry wines ml were they all white any white wines or no 
there was some white we pair we try that with the mint ml so yeah jo perhaps we should 
ml i almost think like a really good pretty sauvignon blanc could attack that sc little bit of acidity 
yeah jo little bit acidity ml yeah jo someone suggested a beer would go well with a mint but 
seems to be a very difficult pairing and that struck me as very curious ml so yeah this is 
to get your hands on but old cabernet always a there could be like a eucalyptus kinda thing going 
interesting ml with that old bordeaux old bordeaux with a mint girl scout sc i love it i love 
ml okay this is what talking about overlapping conversation ml yeah exactly exactly jo perfect old worldnew world ml 
yes jo an old bordeaux with a girl scout cookie thin mint ml high brow and low brow and 
i mean it is just totally all jo what about ml that yeah i love that if red it 
to be old i would say gonna you need the fruit to be shed which i think was other 
the olive jo was probably the problem there ml the olive problem like concentration and kinda cakey almost like 
nature that a lot of amarone has i mean why that jo i like them ml yeah hot yeah 
sc not a huge fan of amarone to be honest more than you but still anyway two big looming 
here that i gotta get to before we finish up ml yeah sc one is a bit of mystery 
only with wine but this process of being a sommelier of being a wine expert you can forget about 
certification and so forth a lot of people like to make themselves feel better by telling themselves that all 
wine tasting is a bit of a hoax right what in your mind goes how accurate can you be 
a wine in a blind tasting how much of it is expertise how much of luck how much of 
how much of perception ml okay well so blind tasting in the context of wine tasting in an exam 
say deductive what is it not what is it not what is it not what is it not if 
that four times my world is small enough to where i have a pretty good idea of going on 
take the reds in front of us so again thin skin thick skin thin skin it can only be 
of so many things so i can before smelled it walking up to the table and sitting down i 
that not a fair amount of things sc so basically saying looking at it and go thin or ml 
so thin yeah thin tend to be lighter thick tend to be heavier like i said that grenache that 
straddle both zinfandel can be kinda screwy too and then age factors into this so i tested at the 
levels i really care to i just sort of sc you have your job you have your dream job 
now doing it ml yeah i have my gig and i like french wine and i like california wine 
i just straight up wanna end up hating wine and i wanna have to memorize all these things that 
passionate about what i do and i defend that so what i was gonna say is that when dealing 
old wine things get kind of screwy with the color red wine gets lighter and white wine gets darker 
basically sitting down and okay thin skin bright ruby almost magenta kinda color okay almost certainly not a syrah 
anything thick skin i can throw out smell it is it fruitdriven is it earthdriven and these are broad 
but just to illustrate the process if earthdriven it probably is from the old world from europe if fruitdriven 
could be but probably not so right there in two steps yanked out a lot of things it can 
if white wines i immediately taste and see if residual sugar if there is then my world just got 
small sc that helps yeah ml or smell and hope that marlborough sauv blanc and to go back to 
i was talking about with the acid level the tannin level the balance between the fruit and the earth 
i mean you can triangulate a lot of things through that and not trying to screw with you not 
not gonna serve you santa barbara county tempranillo serving you classic sc yeah jo mmhmm ml of wines sc 
wanna test your actual knowledge not just like trip you up ml yeah yeah it is hard because you 
you mentioned vintage is it is it that is part rote memorization of classic vintages and just how vintages 
in different regions and a learning curve to that and really hard to taste those wines you have to 
have a trust fund or you have to be a sommelier basically chuckle sc or become an expert on 
ml or well but not even just expensive but getting your hands on old wines that have been stored 
that are gonna show like they should show which they tend to go up in price but not even 
about the astronomical stuff a hard thing to come across and hard thing to have an extensive mental rolodex 
be able to dial through and go i think forty years old i think bordeaux okay so i got 
showing more tertiary flavors than something like a ripe would i think it could be weird going like that 
through the hurdles but if with the deductive process you can get pretty close and you have to show 
work you just show up and overlapping conversation ml had it i killing it i had this last night 
thousand nine hundred ninety domaine jamet boom why long division and it is useful humbling oh my chuckle sc 
overlapping conversation ml real yeah i know it sc more than enough evidence ml yeah of course i sc 
are people who are good at it and people who are not good at it jo ml yeah and 
what so i so this makes me think i get this a lot at the restaurant like you must 
a great palate to do what you like well i think my i split hairs well and the if 
do it enough a scene in the somm documentary where they thought the best way to describe it no 
naturalborn samurai sword maker you had a teacher that had a teacher that had a teacher and if you 
twentyfive wines a night five days a week for even a month much less a couple of years and 
attention at all your palate will exponentially you just have more things to play off jo right sean mentioned 
sort of backlash against one that all bs that there really is no difference and a famous example where 
like to cite that sommeliers were blindfolded and tell the difference between red wine and white wine and that 
bothered me because to me the sensory experience of wine is not just the taste or rather taste is 
vision everything that goes along with it ml yeah jo a much more complicated thing and the minute you 
somebody tying both their hands behind their back ml yeah i mean i just think what are you trying 
a chuckle what happened to you that really against jo who hurt you chuckle ml yeah like what is 
problem man and a lot of people take this way too seriously sc yeah supposed to be having fun 
supposed to be having fun not forget it is a fascinating subject matter no one ever is gonna know 
about it chasing the horizon of trying to learn have this perspective on it people screwed up people know 
or are insecure about it and sc i mean having said that okay be ml yeah sc been in 
where there have been better and worse sommeliers ml totally sc and partly in ability to distinguish wines but 
sort of a human interaction like what do they want kind of thing ml yeah so it is hospitality 
anything else and entertainment especially that when actually not i was gonna say at the level of these michelin 
fancy restaurants no i rescind that statement sc at every level yeah ml at every level it is entertainment 
going out to dinner should be fun and if you are privileged enough to get to say that you 
your money from being a sommelier there is a ideological philosophical weight on your shoulders to not be a 
laughter sc yeah ml please please true sc which is probably incompletely satisfied by the set of sommeliers in 
world i mean i ml i think the somm documentaries have done a lot to help it sc good 
always say like being a cosmologist should make you humble ml yes yes sc compared to the universe very 
and yet there are plenty of cosmologists chuckle who really fulfill this expectation ml yeah figure out what how 
we know sc yeah right ml that is at the end of the day be a last time you 
wine and not something that is this competitive thing is this lorded over people culture that i unfortunately see 
from clientele or not even client from sommeliers like drinking this drinking like then be sc right yeah ml 
right ml and a lot of us get to drink wines that kings of countries are never gonna taste 
like cool right on fortunate enough to choose this path and fortunate enough to get to pull it off 
have to wield that with humility and empathy for not your dinner sc yeah ml it is your dinner 
is the dinner it is what do you want if you want barolo and oysters do it if if 
were in piemonte and you had this barolo that lit your whole world on fire and you were eating 
and you wanna recreate that and just going like that is nothing is gonna work about everything works about 
if sitting there with all the systems go everything firing this is about having fun and not forget consuming 
why are you becoming more of a douche everything is all good jo right sc except that the world 
falling apart so the final issue that i wanna talk about is the idea that our climate is changing 
already indirectly hit upon the fact ml it is sc it is it is changing this is not up 
debate here at mindscape how does it i can see at least two possibilities if there is an effect 
sure there is one would be wine throughout the world gets worse because growing it in climates that not 
to but then the more optimistic possibility that wine just changes we make champagne in britain rather than in 
ml make sparkling wine in britain sc sparkling wine yes chuckle ml yeah yeah yeah sc but maybe the 
will change but be just as good i know how should i be optimistic or pessimistic here ml well 
mean i after having said what i just said i think i have no choice but to be optimistic 
it and i know what the point would be it is changing already changed been involved in wine and 
in wine loving wine for eleven years and even in that amount of time changed looking we already talked 
alcohol levels and regions they are going up and not just due to the critic thing like i mentioned 
of it but just things are heating up and vintages especially in the marginal places become more erratic you 
that in burgundy you see more hail in spring and in the summer which they deal with a fair 
but that reduces the yields so less wine a whole other thing that get talked about a lot with 
climate change is gonna do obviously heating up ripeness levels are gonna go up but each there needs to 
vintages that let the vineyards reset in i was at this producer in volnay in burgundy the marquis this 
winery and the proprietor was talking about where situated in this specific place in volnay where ml these basically 
cut into the hill that makes up burgundy called combes and winds come through there and cool down the 
on the edges but then also bring in storms and he said a lot of cyclical storms they know 
get hit one year at one time like so the next sc now we know ml so happening more 
going down while things are getting riper so that right there just the straight math of that i think 
because been mentioning how wine ages and older wines are beautiful well okay so time is ticking the arrow 
time sc passing ml as someone i know said the wines are being made now are going to say 
these top top level burgundies and bordeauxs from like two thousand fifteen vintage those are at least probably wines 
really firing on all cylinders and those are being made in a time where we know more about viticulture 
we ever have and less of them and because riper more accessible young so people get triggerhappy so the 
that used to be cases are now bottles and people are popping them ml so when you extrapolate this 
the amount of people that are really gonna know what two thousand fifteen richebourg is drinking like is smaller 
then you combine that with the way the markets have gone crazy the prices have just gone through the 
this unsustainable in certain regions i know if a correction gonna happen or just things there are talks about 
the marginal places not even the marginal places but what are now in the goldilocks zone you fastforward the 
the grape makeup might have to be replanted this sacrilegious sentence is pinot noir really what should be in 
in fifteen years sc are the winemakers really facing up to this you think ml well also dealing with 
in places in certain times certain people like a kind of dogmatic way overlapping conversation sc yeah a traditionalist 
ml the european wine world works but yeah a couple of avantgarde people experimenting with syrah and burgundy and 
like the willamette valley in oregon that would be good for a minute but then maybe some syrah there 
a bad thing but then you look at napa already at cab sc where do you go ml where 
you go what are to some jo and i assume cab is just that really ml cabernet sauvignon sorry 
yeah cabernet yeah ml oh yeah it handles warm climates well jo yeah what trying to get at here 
yeah a resilient grape can handle a lot the way the canopies are trimmed is another thing heard people 
talk about where depending on which if in the northern hemisphere for example the vineyard faces south you get 
exposure to the sun than if the vineyard faces north so if planting northfacing vineyards and not trimming the 
as much so that you have more cover things like that but a bandaid if really looking at this 
view another thing that no one knows how to deal with it all the way these experiments going on 
already much different than it was if you even just take the century sc it sounds like people are 
things reasons to think that there will be changes but not the end of the world kind of changes 
it would be nicer if we did not destroy the planet chuckle ml yeah no true and the reality 
forget what the exact stat is but you just take gasoline cars for example you just snap your fingers 
no more made and electric still thirty years out before those are in the junkyard the obviously left the 
i think that not as simple as like so we pick well you also have to physiologically ripen the 
again bandaid not sustainable yeah you already see it the main way i see it is in the production 
is ironic like getting warmer the yields can be but not necessarily especially since dealing with mainly european wines 
erratic nature of the vintages is the kicker sc i always like to end the podcast on optimistic note 
make a slight exception here had plenty of optimism there is plenty of optimism but also we have to 
up to the reality that this is part of the complexity and joy and pleasure of wine compared to 
things is the ancientness of it the tradition of it the fact that so much knowledge is just empirical 
exactly sure why we point to the right chemical compounds and say is what makes it but we know 
growing it and making it this way makes it good and changing and kind of a shame doing people 
doing things to make it better but a possibility something will be lost and so again more reason to 
it while we have it ml yeah definitely and something will be lost but again being optimistic we know 
now than we did when these storied legendary wines were made so the best wines being made are being 
now period sc yeah drinking better wine than thomas jefferson ever could imagine ml yes yes totally and not 
so there is adaptation evolution that will happen by choice or not basically and what are we gonna do 
sc also thomas jefferson never appeared on a podcast once in his life laughter ml that is true sc 
bad for him really alright matthew luczy thanks so much for being here ml thank you sc thanks for 
the wine ml been my pleasure sc thank you jennifer ouellette for joining us jo cheers ml cheers sc 
is a great experience looking forward to my next trip to melisse ml all about it i love it 
you sean sc thanks matthew ml yeah music great episode but love to have a version two with four 
that i could actually afford to follow along i was excited to follow along but i looked these up 
and they are way out of my also loved the episode but at sixty dollars to two hundred fifty 
per bottle sampled not exactly reaching main stream while i will certainly splurge from time to time on a 
bottle of wine at the mentioned minimum price point of twenty dollars bottle there must be something similar to 
illustrate the points made in the show otherwise really doing little to help promote image outside of the domain 
the affluent i agree with james and andy need some of the more affordable wines also some wines makers 
would recommend at a good price point yup i love the ideas but who can afford that kinda nice 
live luxury better than nothing i loved this show comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds 
interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts and ideas
