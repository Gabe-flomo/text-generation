today going to talk about space travel one of the things that you necessarily appreciate when you start talking 
space travel is the very different scales that we might be talking about so not talking about traveling to 
stars today anyway not even talking about the very downtoearth mission of taking a gigantic rocket and launching it 
space to put up human beings or satellites what be talking about is once you get there once out 
space say an orbit around the earth how do you move around the big problem with space travel is 
weight carrying mass up into space and if you rely on conventional methods of propulsion once up there that 
you need an awful lot of fuel just to adjust your position in orbit the space age officially began 
one thousand nine hundred fiftyseven with the launch of the sputnik one satellite but recent years have seen the 
of a boom in the number of objects orbiting earth as satellite tracking and communications have assumed enormous importance

transcript sc so guest natalya bailey is an aerospace engineer who has started a new company called accion systems 
named after a spell in harry potter not after the hypothetical small particles that could be the dark matter 
accion systems is doing or building ion drive engines if of a certain age like i am you remember 
drives as being this way that you might investigate interstellar travel because an ion drive can provide a small 
of propulsion but for a very long time with very little fuel being wasted so accion systems is building 
incredibly tiny centimetersized rocket engines that can be put on to little tiny satellites like cubesats that you and 
educational institution could build and launch into space yourselves and then they will help you move them around from 
to place sc this is going to be an important part of a burgeoning ecosystem where we have a 
of new satellites in space that hopefully will not be crashing into each other and hopefully will be organizing 
in the most efficient way also a stepping stone of course once in space at all once in orbit 
to anywhere halfway to mars halfway to pluto or whatever so this is gonna be an important way that 
advance the cause of traveling through the solar system in much more efficient ways so this is a great 
that we did natalya and i are both science fiction fans ourselves so near the end of the talk 
forget about the solar system and think more broadly about traveling through space sc i do wanna apologize because 
audio quality on this one fades near the end fine at the beginning but the last fifteen minutes are 
little rougher i tried to clean them up as much as i could these podcasts some of them i 
at my house or in my office others i do remotely i will travel to somebody place or at 
conference or something some of them you gotta do over the computer right and the biggest challenge been investigating 
software different websites different services to do this sometimes they work really well sometimes not as well i apologize 
the listeners and to natalya that this time work as well but trying to get better at it still 
at this and i think that i am getting better at it so hopefully this is a temporary glitch 
content of the discussion is really really great so i think gonna enjoy this go music sc natalya bailey 
to the mindscape podcast natalya bailey thanks for having me sean sc obviously we all know that the orbits 
us the sky above us is filled with satellites i think maybe people really have a very good idea 
how densely packed the space is with satellites or how not densely packed i mean hearing about the fact 
a lot of space debris up there but on the other hand space is really big right and you 
have a lot of things up there without any of them running into each other could you just like 
the stage for us a bit and what is the current environment up there in near earth orbit and 
nb sure so as far as the earth orbiting satellites that are focused down here at people living on 
planet every year there are around a thousand spacecraft launched that number has increased from the previous kind of 
industry how done things for the past fifty years been increasing every year for the past decade i think 
start to see numbers more like spacecrafts launched annually so now all of those things last anywhere from a 
months on orbit all the way to fifteen or twenty years on orbit and so you can do that 
and figure out how many of those are up there but the other thing that has people in this 
a bit worried is that sometimes satellites collide with one another or hit another object in space and they 
turn into new pieces of debris and that can actually have a kind of water fall sort of effect 
the kessler syndrome where potentially we could reach a point where there are just so many pieces of this 
in orbit that the problem kinda runs away and we keep creating more and more debris and low earthorbit 
a bit unusable for these earthfacing applications so keeping an eye on that but like i said the number 
year is about a and growing and an exciting time in the industry sc yeah i bet that most 
me i realize that the lifespan was only ten or fifteen years so that means that a satellites are 
to earth every year right nb yeah about right sc and is that life span specific to near earthorbit 
earthorbit i mean how should we in our brains visualize the different places that we put these satellites nb 
great question so a satellite launched to about i think three hundred or so kilometers will stay there for 
a year a satellite launched to five hundred kilometers could stay there for about twenty years and actually an 
relationship with altitude between altitude and lifetime so if you go much above five hundred kilometers and the distance 
the earth you end up basically putting things there that for the all reasonable purposes end up becoming kinda 
fixtures which is not a great position to be in so really the un and then nasa and various 
agencies prefer that things only have about a twenty to twentyfive year lifetime in orbit so that either means 
hundred kilometers and below or that these objects have a way to deorbit themselves at the end of their 
lifetime sc and presumably they burn up in the atmosphere not a threat that gonna land in san francisco 
hurt people right nb yeah i think i believe i read somewhere that more likely to be attacked by 
shark and struck by lightning in the same day than you are to be hit by a piece of 
from a spacecraft sc if i take that statistic seriously i presume that means that no one has ever 
hit by a piece of debris from a space craft nb right sc okay good i realize that nasa 
the space agencies actually encouraged people to launch their satellites into lower earthorbit specifically so that they last so 
part of the solution to the problem of overcluttering orbit is make it temporary nb yes exactly things only 
really problematic if up there for five fifteen years otherwise they do orbit on their own sc and of 
a special geosynchronous orbits where you orbit once every twentyfour hours you can hang out above some particular place 
earth or at least some particular longitude on earth but much farther out right nb yeah exactly much farther 
much more expensive to reach so more for the handful of fortune five hundred companies and then the space 
and roughly kilometers versus the kind of four hundred been talking about sc okay and the environment there in 
of what satellites are up there is changing obviously we have communication satellites we have defense department stuff and 
stuff but these days becoming a lot cheaper right to just send something into space nb yes exactly so 
past i guess now maybe fifteen years had this fantastic combination of private money coming into the space industry 
then law making smaller electronics still quite capable and now able to package those into smaller spacecraft you had 
ever increasing demand for the internet and so these various factors have come together and space has as a 
become more accessible and also more desirable for various applications and more affordable so smaller satellites mean that more 
can access space more organizations even working with a high school team and there are also hobbyists in their 
building satellites sc which i will never stop being amused by but is this the cubesat idea explain to 
what a cubesat is and why so fun nb sure a cubesat is kind of the one industry attempted 
more standard form factor for a satellite so as you know or can imagine a standardized anything basically can 
to reduced costs and therefore more users around the world being able to leverage spacecraft so a cubesat one 
one unit is ten centimeters by ten centimeters by ten centimeters so centimeters cubed and to give you a 
physical sense you could fit a soft ball inside of one u a little bit more popular is a 
that looks a little bit more like a shoe box or a champagne bottle and there are actually commercial 
now launching cubesats that are able to generate revenue which is an extremely new thing in the past decade 
and yeah so you mentioned high schools how much does it cost if say i have built the cubesat 
not very good at it i just built it at home but i trust gonna go up there how 
would it cost me to get it on a rocket and launch it into orbit nb if you are 
high school allin probably spending twenty to if an individual or a commercial business spending maybe two hundred thousand 
sc you mean they charge me more because an individual not a high school nb yes there are a 
of discounted launch opportunities for academic projects sc i see well one hundred thousand dollars is probably outside my 
range for building my personal vanity satellite nb yeah well it keeps coming down sc yeah exactly right and 
you say that there are companies doing the launches so building rockets obviously we hear about nasa launches we 
about spacex and blue origin and so forth but how many companies are there launching things into space nb 
have to factcheck me on these numbers but in something like two thousand eight i believe there were around 
active space companies and then two thousand eighteen there were something like and now some of those are not 
ones actually sending things in to space but part of the value chain somewhere so that gives you a 
of the growth in recent years sc okay yeah no i really had no idea and are they launching 
their home base or do they rent the space at cape canaveral or something nb yeah there are a 
launch sites around the world but the ones i hear most about are people launching from india on their 
vehicle in the us the cape like you mentioned and then on the west coast vandenberg also wallops but 
the coast of virginia but that tends to be more of the government launches and then there our first 
was from new zealand so a new thing for the industry sc okay yeah cool i mean it makes 
to have it done near the ocean right in case something goes terribly wrong nb yes exactly range safety 
call it so try not to fly over children and homes and things like that sc and what are 
of these satellites doing these thousands of satellites that are going into orbit every year nb a couple main 
probably the most prevalent one is communication so whether that is directv or sirius radio to broadband internet to 
type of services those all fall under communications the other main segment is earth observation or imaging so using 
spectral images to infer things about the planet for national security or climate agriculture asset tracking things like that 
then of course you have some of the pure science missions looking at the atmosphere looking at icebergs melting 
other types of earth and atmospheric science and then some separate out maybe military applications but really they can 
a combination or one of those three types that i already mentioned sc right and i presume that most 
the high school ones are trying to do some science or are they trying to do communications nb yeah 
are doing science one of the ones we worked with was taking pictures of venus sc oh okay cool 
not just looking at the earth they can make their own little space telescope and send it into orbit 
yeah exactly sc alright i did not know that okay mentioned your own satellites but not so much in 
satellite business as you are in the little rocket engine business so once these satellites are up there you 
be happy with where located or how orbiting but you might also wanna push them around and where you 
in is that right nb yes right so a very typical use case for one of our systems is 
at launch your satellite but maybe you had to purchase it a cheaper sooner launch so not quite where 
wanted to go or you put precisely where you needed to be so you need a propulsion system to 
or lower your orbit initially if you launch a group of satellites you also want them to stay clustered 
in a very tight group so you need to phase those out along an orbit then presumably your mission 
for five seven fifteen years there are all sorts of forces acting on a spacecraft when in orbit especially 
that long of a period of time there is gravity and atmospheric drag and other perturbations you may need 
avoid collisions with debris like we talked about all sorts of reasons over the lifetime you may need to 
and then at the end of your satellite lifetime responsible for making sure it deorbits responsibly and burns up 
the atmosphere so you also need propulsion for that sc okay so what do people usually do these days 
is the most typical kind of propulsion you would hook up to your little satellite nb well the status 
of the industry frankly has still been really large satellites and there are existing ion engines we build a 
of ion engine there are really large ion engines that work on a geosatellite but those scale down and 
the new industry forming around smaller satellites really have a solution today there are several people trying to scale 
the traditional large technologies to fit on small satellites those have some kind of fundamental plasma physics limitations that 
could get into and then as a kind of backup plan possible to use a type of chemical propulsion 
like a smaller same technology as a rocket for launch but a much smaller version those are not very 
efficient which is why not very popular or you could even do something like a can of compressed air 
open that and use that thrust but kind of the least efficient method so those have been backup plans 
you really need something much more fuel efficient to close a lot of to close basically all of these 
models and make these missions viable sc right yeah get into this a little bit i mean i think 
can of compressed air is a hilarious way to push your satellite around but i think probably most people 
in mind the traditional chemical propulsion where you burn some fuel and push yourself around what is an ion 
compared to that the very idea of an ion engine nb sure so chemical rockets that most people think 
when they think of rocket science or propulsion fundamentally you are releasing chemical energy by breaking bonds through combustion 
transferring that chemical energy into kinetic energy to push the spacecraft so you have say hydrogen and oxygen and 
combust those two fuels fuel and oxidizer together you end up with a very hot gas as a result 
that is forced through a nozzle and out the back of the spacecraft and the spacecraft moves in the 
direction so chemical propulsion and fundamentally based on the conservation of momentum stuff out the back pushes the spacecraft 
so electric propulsion which is what we do based also on conservation of momentum stuff out the back pushes 
forward but we use electrical energy to accelerate a charged particle out the back of the spacecraft so electrical 
kinetic rather than chemical into kinetic nb and actually more efficient to do electrical into kinetic in terms of 
unit mass however you need your own power source when doing the electrical conversion chemical carries the power required 
the reaction and so there is a tradeoff there and also a bit slower so you send fewer particles 
mass out the back so you need more time on orbit to accumulate to get up to the speeds 
you would like to reach but we found that most people in the industry actually have that time available 
would trade it to benefit from the fuel efficiency savings sc so the very very basic idea is you 
charge up and atom you ionize it and then you put it in a strong electric field and push 
so instead of burning some fuel you just take some atoms that are lying around or molecules i know 
tell me and then you can just accelerate them as long as you have electricity in a battery or 
power source lying around nb yes right sc and so the idea of an ion engine i remember reading 
least in the this is gonna get us to interstellar space but the technology already exist it predates your 
but just doing a different spin on it nb yeah right ion engines have been used on commercial spacecraft 
on interplanetary spacecraft but near impossible to scale down that particular technology to fit on a smaller satellite sc 
what kind of technology is it that they use in the the big ones nb so a conventional ion 
works by injecting a neutral gas into an ionization chamber so inject xenon or argon into a chamber and 
inject a stream of highenergy electrons and the job of those electrons is to find and collide with one 
those neutrals atoms and to kick off an electron thereby ionizing the xenon atom to know you have a 
ion and then some fraction of those xenon ions hopefully makes it to the downstream grid where actually two 
and an electric field between them so if an ion find way into this electric field accelerated out the 
of the spacecraft producing thrust sc okay i see even though a theoretical physicist not an engineer i can 
the possibility for some inefficiencies in this initial process where just escorting gas into a chamber and ionizing it 
yes so even at the larger scales there are several inefficiencies losing ions into the walls all the time 
then as you could also imagine as you tried to scale this technology down the first thing you do 
you make that ionization chamber smaller because it has to fit on a smaller spacecraft and what essentially done 
reduced the amount of time the residence time that the neutral xenon atoms and those electrons spend in that 
so reduced the likelihood that collide with one another and so you basically form any ions if you make 
chamber small enough so to combat that you have to increase that likelihood again and so you inject more 
electrons into the chamber to improve your odds but now you have so many highenergy electrons and many of 
end up going right into the walls of the chamber and to get back to that same ionization fraction 
actually put so many into the walls that you melt most materials known to man that could be used 
this application so it actually really close on many of the scales of these smaller satellites sc okay so 
company is accion right is that how we pronounce your company name nb yes accion sc it sounds exactly 
a particle physics hypothetical dark matter candidate but spelled differently nb right sc but so you are devoted to 
a better technology that can be made smaller and more portable for the ion engine idea nb yes so 
get away from conservation of momentum and we know that we sc that would be bigger news i would 
had you on the podcast earlier nb that would have been a different podcast yeah and we know that 
want to use electrical energy to accelerate charged particles out the back of the spacecraft so those things hold 
how can we maybe get away from this ionization probability and needing to inject this gas in these electrons 
we looked at using instead a liquid propellant called an ionic liquid actually and quite popular in the battery 
electrochemical cell applications and really just positive and negative ions that happen to be liquid over a wide range 
temperatures not in solution no water or anything just positive and negative ions so we took these liquids and 
said can we apply the same electric field that those ion engine guys apply between their grids to accelerate 
ions but can we not only accelerate ions can we also extract ions of one polarity out of this 
and then accelerate them with that same potential with that same electric and it turns out that if you 
clever with the ways you kind of orient the geometries and design these systems you can nb and so 
need to ionize anything on orbit we already have positive and negative ions so we need this large chamber 
these collisions to occur in we just really need that grid and this source of ion then the reason 
cofounder and i we actually met as grad students in a lab and we have entrepreneurial aspirations at the 
but the reason that there was this need for this and there was great timing was this is actually 
happening on a very small scale this ion emission from these liquids occurs within a region of about twenty 
and so instead of taking something really large and trying to scale it down and basically tinking the efficiency 
started with this mechanism which happens on a small scale and now we can just parallelize it and scale 
up to be able to work on satellites of all sizes sc i see okay and so the main 
here is that in the chemical propulsion the actual propellant is the same thing as the fuel right to 
you burn it and then you expel it whereas here you will carry around this little liquid of ions 
of preionized in some sense nb yeah sure sc i guess with the different kinds of ions gently hugging 
other and you can easily take them apart nb right yeah sc yeah and then but separately you have 
source of power which is electricity so do you carry a battery up there or do is it solar 
typically nb so yeah we draw power from the spacecraft so a combination of solar energy and batteries sc 
and so the limit is basically how much fuel you can bring up the limit for how much thrust 
have over the lifetime of the satellite nb yes right sc and how long do you have i mean 
these into centimeters sized or tens of centimetersized boxes how much lifetime can you have for pushing yourself around 
yes you just nailed the most important metric at accion right now demonstrated that the technique works now to 
it actually useful to various types of missions and customers with satellites lifetime is the key here so when 
spun out of our lab we were operating for ten hours twenty hours recently we just broke a hours 
actually what now ready to go to market with that so on the order of thousands of hours sc 
cool so our audience is visualizing this these rocket engines are really tiny things right nb yes we build 
complete system with the thruster head where the ions are extracted and accelerated but also the propellant supply system 
the tank and then the power electronics for interfacing with the space craft but the thruster head itself where 
of the magic occurs is we build it in thruster chips and each chip is a square centimeter and 
can arrange any number of these chips together in different places on a spacecraft to accomplish your mission sc 
a square centimeter and thinner in the third dimension right so less than a cubic centimeter nb about two 
sc yeah okay so you basically glue these to the walls of your engine and your rocket nb yes 
to the walls of your satellite nb right sc alright that is a very cool idea and has it 
yet are you in orbit nb yes well when we were still at mit we launched a couple back 
and just recently accion launched our first two at the end of last year and now working on another 
launches this year so yes sc but hoping to do a launches a year i presume nb yes exactly 
a growing a booming thing right nb yeah sc and how much thrust are we getting out of this 
this like a g or probably a tiny little amount guessing nb tiny little amount each chip produces about 
and a half to fifty micronewtons so on the lower end of that about as much as a mosquito 
on your hand laughter sc but you keep it up for hundreds of thousands of hours and you can 
move the satellite around is the idea right nb yes and when in space and not trying to get 
of a gravity well or trying to compete against atmospheric drag the force really adds up and producing enough 
to complete most commercial missions today so sc yeah just to be super clear i know clear to me 
you but for everyone nothing doing is solving the issue of getting into orbit right you are not launching 
spacecraft gluing your little centimeter sized tiles onto the sides of something already in orbit and nudging it from 
orbit to another nb right doing inspace propulsion so the satellite has already been launched and then we take 
from there sc and always gonna be true right no version of this gonna help us get into space 
the idea nb there are universes where possible where nuclear or some other antimatter type of energy source is 
to power a system like this right now politically i think that will be possible but as far as 
physics go not impossible sc i see so basically is the limitation just how strong of an electric field 
can have or is it how much fuel you can carry around nb no actually for launch the current 
is in the power supply system so the specific power power per kilogram most power sources that people feel 
launching from a country with people living in it are that number is too low the power per kilogram 
too low but there are possibilities where you could launch small things with known power sources or with some 
theoretical ones in the future sc and have i heard that people are imagining printing launch systems that will 
us into space how close are we to a truly revolutionarily new relationship with getting things into orbit and 
them there nb yeah i think i mean even today some of the new launch companies are printing a 
of the main components or innovating around having purely electric pumps things like that so getting there in terms 
the components then there are things like operational considerations how do you build a factory around this when your 
is quite lumpy or uncertain a bit of a chicken and egg problem if they could be guaranteed launches 
year we could start seeing a lot of innovation on the launch side if we could be guaranteed five 
dollars a kilogram to orbit we could see more innovation on the satellite side so fortunately we have some 
rich people that like launching stuff into space working on these problem so i think heading in the right 
sc and not you not one of those the lucky little upstart nb yeah exactly sc and i presumed 
in space like everything in space a lot of defense commercial customers i guess i mean a lot of 
for existing people i know that just this morning i read an article where india was able to shoot 
a satellite and so now the fourth country that has officially been able to shoot down a satellite and 
makes you think about the future of the militarization of space nb yes so right now about half of 
market is government or military and space in the to was a big asset for spacefaring countries now kind 
flipped into a liability and so dependent on it but now not a rare place that only a few 
can access so how do we protect the things so dependent on now up there and yeah i think 
government and military side of that will change a lot in the coming years and a lot of things 
if following the space force and the things happening in the pentagon versus happening in the air force and 
lot of changes right now sc yeah well not really following it so for the audience is there specific 
that we should be looking out for even if not set in stone but just what kinds of things 
people contemplating nb yeah so the air force has traditionally been where most of the space activity as far 
defense has been housed under and the point i made earlier about it becoming a place trying to figure 
how to protect our assets in means that now the pentagon is considering creating a separate branch of the 
for space specifically in recognition of that and so there are moves happening like that and some reorganizations as 
us tries to navigate our next couple decades in space sc and i help but think as someone trained 
an astronomer one of the great things to do in space is to explore other planets are your engines 
to be useful for that kind of thing either getting once in orbit getting to other planets or once 
manipulating the orbits of satellites and probes that nasa may wanna launch nb yeah absolutely so on our road 
is increasing the amount of thrust or power we can produce per unit area and fortunately the particular technology 
on has the potential to be scaled along those lines in ways that are unlike any other electric system 
today whether flight proven or theoretical this technology has legs and we can certainly see it being used on 
space like missions or interplanetary science missions in the future especially as we continue to improve that metric the 
per unit area sc does it make sense to sort of use conventional fuel rockets to get into space 
then use ion engines to guide yourself to mars or something like that nb yeah until we solve that 
per kilogram issue we were talking about earlier continue to use chemical rockets for launch from a gravity well 
is a planet or a massive planet so continue to do that and then use more efficient means once 
space sc how do you personally see the future in this sense where there was the space race in 
and we went to the moon and that was very exciting but now the united states correct me if 
here we even get a person into space right now right as a country we have that capability nb 
well right we do send up us astronauts but not on our own rockets so looking a little bit 
ahead i think a big question is mars the answer is the moon the answer are stations in between 
the answer and i have my own opinion which is that a bit risky to plant yourself in another 
well once you make it off of one so i mean that if you get off of the planet 
probably worthwhile considering building an orbiting station maybe at around the earth or something at a lagrange point and 
think i would change my mind a little bit more on that if there were planets that we need 
go terraform or that had really wonderful atmospheres and were more homey feeling for us quite frail so i 
being able to design and curate our environment a little bit more will be a more feasible next step 
i like that what you call a gravity well the rest of us call a planet but chuckle nb 
it have to be a planet right sc it could be a moon i suppose yes right but i 
your point especially people who seem sanguine about the idea of terraforming mars it seems always very unrealistic to 
when not even very good at controlling the climate of our own planet right here on earth nb yeah 
always come back to that too and i necessarily view it as a like we messed up this one 
find a different but i do think that if humans are around in four hundred years probably because we 
a way to live off of just this one planet and to diversify a little bit in terms of 
able to support life but yeah i think we could probably make it easier on ourselves by not picking 
already pretty harsh right off the bat sc it did sound like before you were optimistic about just building 
space stations and living there do you think that is a largescale possibility nb yeah and i think i 
a more incremental path to doing that you have to get a lot of humans to a more distant 
you can build it in stages yes i can see that line a little bit more clearly sc it 
of course the hard part of that is that it requires taking a lot of construction materials up into 
right if you had to make something really big if you wanna put a million people on a habitat 
you built artificially in space be quite the undertaking but i guess saying at least you can do it 
by nb yeah and aside from just having something to stand on on mars already you really have much 
we know if we could use the actual materials we find there to build anything so i think the 
in those terms would look that much different in the end sc yeah and so between you and me 
know that the government and not really between you and me on the podcast chuckle but always looking for 
bigger goal should we go back to the moon should we go back to mars so it sounds like 
think that neither one of those obvious goals are the right ones nb well the objectives are a little 
different i think still a lot of science to be done you end up in my field working at 
ion engine company without wondering about the origins of the universe and why here and how planets form so 
think yes of course we understand anything yet and so always reasons to visit and keep supporting those types 
missions but if thinking about it in the survival and longevity terms i think there may be other places 
other ways to consider that sc and what about from watching science fiction tv shows i imagine that in 
future gonna be mining the asteroids for all of our valuable raw materials do you think feasible and do 
think ion engines are gonna help us take an asteroid and push it closer to earth so we can 
it more easily nb yes i do think eventually be able to kind of harness the resources that are 
just our own planet absolutely sc this is a crazy unfair question but what kind of time scale do 
think that would involve nb well i even necessarily think impossible to do today more of a question of 
resources and priorities so given how things are looking today you could say it will never happen but i 
technologically i think there are many parts of a mission like that at least for a very nearearth object 
are actually infeasible sc do you i mean how much we know about what is in the asteroids never 
understood the extent to which it would potentially be worth it in the sense that is it actually easier 
efficient more economical to get certain materials from asteroids than it is just from here on earth where we 
are and we can breathe while doing it nb yeah so kind of a funny economical argument where i 
someone that was looking into mining asteroids for things like platinum but as soon as you start bringing back 
amount of platinum to the earth and inserting it into the market all of a sudden the value of 
has completely diminished and so how do you justify the cost of doing that but i think if a 
of the energy cost of well much more expensive to go back down to earth to grab this water 
to grab these other materials that we can harvest that are passing nearby then i think there are a 
of instances where that equation works out sc okay good to know so as spinning science fiction scenarios here 
science purposes could we imagine using engines ion engines maybe like your own or maybe some other design to 
objects in space capture a comet that is passing by i presume very informally that things that are moving 
are just doing so quite quickly and it would be an impossibly difficult task to slow them down and 
them closer but maybe wrong about that nb yeah so in poor space person form i really done the 
trade through like if you needed to launch all of the propellant from earth and to stage it nearby 
there was something you wanted to go to and attach to and then push it closer to earth or 
a few experiments i walked through those scenarios in much detail but if we go back to the science 
side of things a little bit the asteroid that passed through our solar system not too long ago oumuamua 
was shaped suspiciously like a solar sail that came from way outside our solar system and this is the 
object to pass through that has ever done that and i absolutely think we should have done more with 
one very suspicious and worth studying i think so yes i hope our technology can be a part of 
types of missions in the future but i walked through the full trade study sc yeah okay i think 
to be fair to the audience you should probably fill in a little bit of the details amazing glad 
pronounced the name of it i pronounce the name of it oumuamua is that it nb yeah sc yeah 
was this object which is certainly from interstellar space right not something that was already in the solar system 
it for whatever reason flew through the solar system and it was not in the shape of a little 
ball it was apparently more or less big and flat and i know that avi loeb a friend of 
harvard astronomy professor suggested in a paper that maybe one of the things it could be is a solar 
designed by some alien civilization many other people poopooed that idea but maybe what saying is look if even 
chance it would certainly be worth checking that out nb yeah exactly and well i think you just did 
good overview of what it was but its shape as far as we could tell looked very peculiar it 
shaped in such a way that it could have captured photons from the sun or other stars to give 
the force it needed to actually make it to our solar system and then i think there was something 
about its trajectory that suggested that it had had a burst of thruster or force for some reason and 
best guess as humans is that it passed by something that heated it up and caused gases to expand 
give it a push but i am still hopeful that there is more there that we should have looked 
so i hope we get to the next one and i hope to be a part of that sc 
think giving the aliens credit you think they could have designed a craft that would have slowed down and 
rather than just zooming by spending all that effort to send an object to another star system and then 
have it visit for a few weeks nb well i think that getting into my crazy theories of various 
about the universe so i think gotta be other life in the sense of other selfreplicating molecules so not 
in that other bacteria probably out there but not sure convinced that anybody anyone else that falls into that 
category has solved the faster than speed of light travel problem before they were perhaps hit by a mass 
sort of asteroid or something but say there was other life out there that generated a lot of knowledge 
how to do some of these things then were hit by some sort of impact part of their planet 
off and is traveling through our solar system as oumuamua we could probably learn a lot by studying it 
okay nb if i had to pause at something where worth landing sc no i do think very much 
agreement with the philosophy that if such a high reward kind of gamble then yeah take it at least 
that possibility but i think that there is a solution to the faster than light problem as a physicist 
think that problem is not going away but do you think that if true if we ever go faster 
light what do you think is the prospect for we human beings sending spacecraft to other stars nb well 
mean alpha centauri that far away i love the breakthrough starshot ideas about using lasers to send tiny little 
spacecraft past that star system and maybe take pictures and send them back and i mean honestly the thing 
love about that project is that every single part of it is impossible today and so exciting laughter sc 
yeah i think not everyone is gonna know exactly what that is so this was a proposal i remember 
hawking was part of the pr push for it but it came from a yuri milner and the other 
prize people nb yeah right so there are several initiatives under the breakthrough prize name and breakthrough listen breakthrough 
and there was one other that maybe we can record my voice as knowing later but this particular one 
starshot the goal is to use i know gagillion watt laser to accelerate tiny spacecraft with little solar sails 
speed such that they could reach alpha centauri in i think it was twenty years and so that get 
close to traveling at a respectable fraction of the speed of light and that their signal could come back 
time so that people in our lifetime could actually start to see this data coming back but the laser 
if those tiny spacecrafts were to send that signal back from that far away you would need a receiver 
size of the distance between the sun and the earth to capture the data we know what needs to 
done and none of possible today but i think you have some of the smartest people in the world 
about it which is really exciting sc yeah no really great and i think that personally since i think 
gonna go faster than the speed of light but i also necessarily think that that should be an obstacle 
going to other stars people say if we travel at point one with the speed of light and then 
be dead if a human being or a set of people in the space but number one we could 
sleep right we could cryogenically suspend people or number two we could come up with therapies that extend human 
spans to thousands of years and i think that those are even though those are nowhere near technologically feasible 
much more technologically feasible than going faster than the speed of light so we should just learn to be 
about these things nb yeah right there with you i think humans in our frail biological forms are the 
problem there and so instead maybe we send some stem cells and a robot or something and then see 
happens sc i see so no a new idea so you basically want to have the ingredients for a 
being and send them into space rather than sending the whole human being nb yeah or the other way 
could take it and kind of getting at what you said various therapies to extend our lives but really 
to buy into the idea that really our memories are really the only things that make us kind of 
and so if we can just figure out how to read and write those just package those into the 
and then you really need these animal forms anymore sc alright i think that certainly i would be surprised 
the first probe that we intentionally send to other stars had human beings on it that does seem to 
an inefficient way to do it so what about the other way around you hinted just before that you 
very likely that there is other life out there in the galaxy but maybe not other intelligent life it 
itself do you have thoughts behind these probability estimates nb yeah so i looked at this recently i think 
odds of getting to a selfreplicating molecule are very high especially given the number of earthlike planets in the 
so certainly i think that cropped up all the time ask me what the means but then you have 
other probabilities that need to occur depending on kind of the conditions on the planet like does that life 
to make it out of the oceans onto land do giant reptiles need to become extinct before mammals can 
take over so i really factored those in but the main problem i see is that to make it 
that point that probability is probably about the same probability as that whole planet getting wiped out by some 
of catastrophe i know if selfmade or from the universe sc external yeah nb yeah but i while i 
that necessarily see another craft from alien planet because fermi paradox like why we already i do think there 
probably signals or other signs of this life and whether we need to travel to that planet to dig 
out of the earth or whether it got to the point where able to put off some sort of 
signature or something not sure but i believe out there sc so yeah so the fermi paradox the idea 
if any time in the past history of the galaxy intelligent life became spacefaring we noticed it a long 
ago and we yet be honest my personal favorite solutions to that are that either life is really really 
that much harder than we think the biochemistry is not something fully understood yet or intelligent life technological life 
much harder than we think i think these are twophase transitions we quite understand yet it seems that you 
more inclined to think that intelligent life happens with a respectable frequency but then somehow it gets destroyed is 
fair nb out on whether life makes it all the way to intelligent life i guess i would say 
it probably does with some lesser frequency but yes then the likelihood that it gets destroyed is even greater 
then the tragedy is that knowledge is lost so each time every form is starting over so if we 
just pass on the atomic theory or something maybe maybe then one of these civilizations could make it to 
speed travel or at least fire or a little bit faster sc what is your feeling about the search 
extraterrestrial intelligence as we do it these days nb well like i said i think possible there are some 
of electromagnetic signals we should be able to pick up so i know we do that type of listening 
i think fairly well and then really i think probably a lot of evidence of life in the more 
sense but we have to kinda make it to those other planets or find bits of them that have 
blasted off by impacts or something passing near earth to be able to determine that so i kind of 
just a matter of time sc okay i like the optimism there personally i think that the chances that 
technologically advanced alien civilizations are wasting their power by beaming radio waves out into space seems unlikely to me 
again if a tiny chance it would be it would change history if it were true so i am 
in favor of looking just in case nb yeah i will forever remain really suspicious of pulsars too like 
are those those have gotta be something that we understand yet sc always possible i wanted to end everything 
interview with you always you mentioned that you kind of got into this game because what you really wanted 
to be an astronaut nb yes sc is that still an ongoing ambition nb yeah keep applying never made 
past the very preliminary rejection postcard phase and to be honest i think i wanna be the first person 
go visit anywhere but i still have the dream very much to go do science in space sc i 
is it still even with private rocket launchers sending people into space is it still the prospect that people 
into space are going to be officially astronauts or is space tourism and option for you also nb not 
much of a risk taker so i would be really into going to a space station because i needed 
do an experiment that could only be done in microgravity like that or maybe one of these orbiting stations 
be built in my lifetime and need people to go figure out how to best design some part of 
or where to put the ion engines and so go to help with that and i do think space 
will become a bigger part of our lives and our discussions going forward but i probably sign up sc 
right well i hope that they finally come to their senses and pick you for it but not until 
perfecting these engines i think that these ion engines are definitely gonna be a big part of how we 
at the solar system and the earth in the near future so natalya bailey thanks so much for being 
the podcast that was a fun conversation nb yeah thank you sean music of the charts intriguing natalya bailey 
is an articulate young lady who knows her stuff and explains it well thoroughly enjoyed this episode sean thanks 
ensuring there are consistent tags on the download files artist album etc if i could ask for one more 
it would be to make the title tag the same as the title on the web site ie for 
file the title tag would be episode natalya bailey on navigating earth orbit and beyond at a minimum the 
tag would include the episode number thanks again for the great content yep mindscape is still one of the 
best podcasts on the web ironically the latter part of this episode where sean said the audio was problematic 
maybe the most fun part the kind of speculative yet informed chat you could have after a glass of 
i want to know how to spell this thing so i can look it up i heard of it 
now speaking of audio sean at the beginning of the podcast you mentioned the audio issues and from what 
said it seems having to fix this stuff yourself i have many years of professional experience in that area 
for clients including disney music and sound including audio editing and restoration is what i do for a living 
to your podcast previously and would be happy to contribute further by helping with any audio issues you may 
free of charge let me know if you ever need a hand because the world needs more podcasts like 
as a follower of your work for some years now so glad you decided to start mindscape i look 
to it every week please keep it coming for years to come best regards michael and thanks for the 
but easier for me to do audio myself the issue here was with the website we used to connect 
our equipment etc working to make sure it happen again comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the 
most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts and ideas
