episode click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean 
and start with a very quick metanote about going on with the podcast in particular i wanted to mention 
we now have transcripts of every episode that are going to appear on the webpage with the individual posts 
the episodes have the entire transcript as soon as it appears this of course costs money not doing it 
so a huge thank you to those who are supporting the podcast on patreon the ones who made that 
so i think gonna be very good both for accessibility and also for searchability you can go in and 
can see what the podcast is about even before you listen to it search for terms throughout the whole 
gonna be really good sc moving on to show i want you to think about what is happening in 
brain at this very moment listening to my words or reading the words if reading the transcripts one way 
another a signal coming in just say that listening hearing sounds so a vibration going on in your eardrums 
sentences and so forth and you can recognize these words just like you can recognize nonverbal sounds but something 
going on the set of words coming in we create meaning we attach to these words to these sounds 
hearing some picture of what trying to say some relationship between these sounds and something out there in the 
or some abstract concept or something like that sc so how does that happen how is it that a 
of sounds hitting our eardrums get turned into meaning inside the brain what talking about on episode with professor 
poeppel who is a professor at nyu and also the director of max planck institute in frankfurt germany i 
this max planck institute is called the institute for empirical aesthetics i have no idea what that means but 
know that what david does is actually study going on inside your brain he studies it not primarily with 
standard fmri picture which is when you put brain inside head you take a brain out you put head 
a machine and look at where the blood is flowing to to pinpoint where things are happening in the 
which is very precise in terms of where things are happening but slow you see when things are happening 
mostly david uses meg machines magnetoencephalograph machines to see exactly when a thought is happening inside your brain in 
if you have my book big you can see an image of my brain not the conventional wrinkly crinkly 
that are used from pictures of the brain but just a very crude image of that quadrants of my 
in which different magnetic fields are appearing as charged particles race around from neuron to neuron perfect evidence that 
really do have a brain inside my head so it turns out that this question asking about how sounds 
turned into language and meaning people have thought about this for a long time a standard model if you 
but that standard model appeared in the and has not been updated as much as you would like since 
sc so with his collaborator gregg hickok david poeppel has suggested an updated model something called the dualstream model 
isolates not just one part of the brain but different parts of the brain that are responsible for different 
of language processing talk about that exactly how it works and also just because david is an opinionated guy 
about all sorts of other issues in neuroscience including the role of big data how coming along and understanding 
and so forth so music sc david poeppel welcome to the mindscape podcast david peoppel hi there nice to 
here sc yeah this is completely by accident that we met each other known each other for a while 
were a famous participant at the moving naturalism forward meeting back in but now i happened to be in 
area where you live so of course gonna podcast you and great start by laying the ground work trying 
think of a way for the audience to describe what you do for a living a professor in half 
the departments of the various universities that a member of is it okay to say thought and language dp 
enough the oneliner that i try to remind myself of is study how you go from vibrations in the 
to abstractions in the head so as having this conversation the only signal actually getting is your eardrum vibrating 
sending sound your way and amazingly that turns into abstract ideas words ideas in your head the fact that 
works at all is already amazing and weird and all the subprocesses are things that i study in my 
sc yeah great way of putting it really the position of the eardrum it only vibrates in one dimension 
only in and out dp right sc so we get one number time stream into our brain and from 
we create everything we think about dp the fact that it works at all is astonishing and the fact 
it works at the speed at which doing it is even more astonishing you have a bunch you have 
of thousands of words stored in your head and sitting in my lovely backyard in connecticut and a little 
noisy we might see a bear walk by and yet you can extract complicated information in segments of tens 
milliseconds how does that work at all and so those are the kinds of problems i worry about and 
includes obviously listening to music listening to sounds that are not speech but the major emphasis in my lab 
on speech perception and language comprehension sc just a note for podcast listeners if a bear does walk by 
will let you know but we are inside relatively safe right dp ish sc thinking the bear could probably 
through these flimsy walls that are surrounding dp well looking pretty tasty so we gotta be careful sc all 
be careful good so how do you go about doing this well actually let me back up even before 
get to how you go about it what got you here did you when you were ten years old 
thinking wanna understand how audio signals in my ear turn into abstract dp exactly sc good for you dp 
what i wanted to know when i was even yes as a pubescent boy those were my main thoughts 
i got there completely by accident or partial accident after college i really wanted to be an actor or 
a director i really wanted to be a director sc you really wanted to direct dp everybody wants to 
a director i really wanted to be a director partially because my wife is an actress and she was 
successful actress and then we thought one of us should have a so i thought i should perhaps go 
graduate school and i ended up accidentally in a neuroscience lab working for a distinguished neurobiologist at mit learning 
to do neurophysiology and all the using the different tools but in the back of my head i liked 
i grew up in a very multilingual environment and it was something i had a gut level intuition about 
people at that point said a famous language researcher here you should probably go listen to some of the 
his name is noam i said interesting go to some of those and i did and that was sort 
like somebody opens the curtains for you you go to some of those sc a little epiphany yeah dp 
you suddenly have a completely different view of how language can be looked at studied investigated and really a 
experience and at that point i decided to go to graduate school to study how language works how speech 
and then began to connect it to my interest in biology accidental i really did wanna be a director 
kidding i still wanna be a director sc young you could do it dp but now a director of 
max planck institute so that sort of counts sc no dp but not sc it count at all dp 
quite have the same vibe sc so put noam chomsky in perspective for us since you mentioned him obviously 
huge name a huge name not only in the academic field of linguistics and psychology but outside forget about 
outside and the politics my impression is my impression is completely untrustworthy here so hoping correct it that chomsky 
extremely influential but a sense of moving beyond him or have we simply improved upon what tell us a 
bit what he had to say and how we think of it today dp he remains an incredibly influential 
very polarizing figure his influence derives from the fact that he really changed how we do psychology and language 
and philosophy of mind in the based on the series of his early books and papers he first of 
effectively got rid of behaviorism and one can even pinpoint that sc tell us what behaviorism is sorry dp 
was the dominant view in psychology for decades before that and a very pleasing and simplistic view effectively it 
down to one principle of the mind which is the principle of association the basis for all of the 
of conditioning conditioning underlies learning conditioning underlies effectively all of behavior so the term became used as a catchall 
for all of psychology and psychology was based on the principle of association now a very sc so pavlov 
his dog is a classic dp pavlovian conditioning and operant conditioning and then of course the most say egregious 
we just went is work so knows sc bf skinner dp bf skinner had famously and a professor at 
worked on the skinner box with the presupposition that you could put even your own children and i begrudge 
and said as a father of three sons and i said you put them into the box and train 
explicitly to respond in selective ways to certain stimuli and so the stimulus response stimulus response paradigm was the 
paradigm for learning memory for everything in psychology and neuroscience sc did some of i know this is a 
but okay we have time did some of this reflect the influence of positivism in the sense that rather 
looking for some underlying mechanisms we should just look at what happens in the world and describe it as 
as possible dp yeah and i think the more sophisticated behavior certainly were avid readers of viennese positivism i 
think but i think that the most disturbing part of the story of behaviorism is that still around sc 
course dp deeply and certainly true in my field in the neurosciences i think actually the default position now 
influence of chomsky was to argue in my view successfully that you really wanted to have a mentalist stance 
psychology and he had a lot of very interesting arguments he also made a number of very important contributions 
computational theory to computational linguistics and obviously to the philosophy of mind and bracketing his political work and sc 
which is interesting but separate dp separate although i think he see it as completely separate in a principled 
but it is separate and he is as you may know very well known in europe as a political 
in some sense and basically not invited on most us channels because too obnoxious sc never yeah of course 
and you just hear you see him on tv shows in the netherlands but in the us in some 
of fringe radio show in cambridge massachusetts or something like that sc yeah dp but he difficult i actually 
finished a chapter a couple last socalled influence of chomsky on the neuroscience of because many of us are 
influenced by that the fact of the matter is his role has been both deeply important and moving and 
and partly because so relentlessly undidactic if ever picked up any of his writings all about the work not 
to make it bitesize and fun he assumes a lot a lot of technical knowledge and a lot of 
work and so if not into that never gonna get past page one because it is technical but made 
very difficult because it seems obscurantist to many people sc always very interesting there are so many fields where 
people manage to have huge outside influences despite being really hard to understand is it partly the cache of 
reward you feel when you finally do understand something difficult dp i wish that were true that would mean 
lot of people would read say my boring papers but i think in the case of chomsky true because 
are superficial misinterpretations and misreadings that are very catchy the most famous concept is language is innate now such 
claim was never made and never said much more nuanced highly technical about the structure of the learning apparatus 
nature of the evidence that the learner gets obviously this is a very sophisticated and nuanced notion but what 
out is that claim is language is and sc but i can remember that and repeat it at cocktail 
dp exactly and a little bit unfortunate because true for all fields if there are nuggetsized oneliners fun to 
fun to talk about but probably almost always wrong sc right dp stuff is complicated sc yes stuff is 
generative grammar is the other phrase that i associate with chomsky all of my chomsky comes from reading language 
steven pinker dp steve is one of my professors in graduate school did a remarkable job popularizing the language 
linguistics although himself actually not a linguist a psychologist of course lots of the interpretation of what people think 
chomsky comes through the lens of how pinker wrote about it and of course that has its own interesting 
steve is a remarkable writer and fabulously interesting thinker but he has his own lens sc yes dp and 
should probably go to the source and read the actual material to understand sc writing a book about quantum 
right now and everyone should read it and everything i say in it is correct but not necessarily what 
else thought in the past even though i tried my best to represent dp no no i think in 
books of course every word is true it goes without saying sc good to know that some people out 
who like that dp but yeah sometimes especially in say technical disciplines you have to do the hard work 
you cut any corners you have to actually get into the technical notions and what are the presuppositions what 
the say hypothesized primitives of a system how do they work together to generate the phenomena interested and so 
the concept of generative grammar a notion of grammar trying to go away from simply a description or list 
factoids about languages and trying to say how is it that you have a finite set of things in 
head a finite vocabulary and ostensibly a finite number of possible rules maybe just one rule who knows but 
can generate and understand an infinite number of possible the concept typically called sc yep okay dp a cool 
and the idea was to work it out well if the parts list how can you have a system 
how can you learn that system acquire that system how can that system grow in you and you become 
competent user of it actually subtle and you sc of course dp right it requires thinking deeply about what 
actually the part architecturally given to you as a human being having a human brain in which sense do 
have to be parochial a human brain has its own properties and which things are say general properties of 
vertebrate how do they interact what do you need is there extra special sauce do you need god god 
laughter and things like that of course this has had a tremendous influence on how we think about the 
and how we study it what kind of methods we can use and what are the bigger questions sc 
safe to say the mind is not a blank slate the brain does have functions in there dp pretty 
a good bet i think you can put that on the bet sc and when it comes to language 
is what i remember from pinker is that in some sense a set of switches in the brain hypothetically 
by learning different languages we flip one way or another dp i think a pretty fair way to think 
it you can think of it as parameters or something like that people think about it in many different 
but we can certainly assume that we have a look back up for a second suppose we were talking 
the visual system and not the language system we be having this discussion because people would say sc a 
dp you have a visual system you have it because a vertebrate brain and obviously it changes in some 
as a function of around you this is not newsworthy but as soon as we talk language everyone is 
expert everyone speaks a language everyone has a powerful intuition and the amount of nonsense promulgated astonishing the level 
silliness is kind sc very sympathetic written three popular books so far one on the nature of time one 
the higgs boson and one on the big picture and the meaning of life by far the best amazon 
are for the higgs boson book because no one has a preexisting view of the higgs boson willing to 
what you have to say about it but they think they know the meaning of life and they think 
know how time works and if you agree with what they have to say not gonna be receptive dp 
again something well in the arts i guess it would be called do we still appreciate the pain in 
neck of having to do the hard work to become a connoisseur or have technical knowledge on something and 
whatever it takes a long time hard and you might not get very good at it but it turns 
to be required if you wanna become really good at knowing the old masters of the netherlands you can 
a connoisseur only if you actually study it likewise with language or the brain or physics well damn sit 
do the work sc having said that proceed to drastically oversimplify how the brain works dp yes drastically do 
sc where did you go after being inspired by chomsky and started studying how the brain processes what we 
dp yeah i studied a lot of the technical aspects of language for a while and i became relatively 
like everyone else of my generation i guess seduced by the possibilities that we now have of recording from 
human brain so when i was a graduate student about early on in graduate school was the time when 
modern brain imaging machines were actually first developed and first rolled out for many years we had things like 
and cat scans but in the late there was a lot of research using pet scanning positron emission tomography 
very onerous and in some sense invasive technique to take pictures of the brain while it was processing something 
a complicated way with a lot of analytic steps and then in the early there was really a gamechanging 
the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri we call it probably seen an mri machine in every hospital 
blown out your knee or your shoulder or god forbid had your head scanned those are ubiquitous dp and 
were a lot of interesting developments both in the physics of magnetic resonance and in engineering and signal processing 
allowed us to begin to use these machines to measure and quantify the human brain while something is happening 
lying in it looks like a giant hair dryer or something like that a tube lying in this sausage 
really taking pictures called a tomographic technique or an imaging technique and it was able to take pictures of 
parts of your head were informally speaking active when you were doing something like listening to words or listening 
a piece of music or moving your right finger or looking at a checkerboard those are the usual experiments 
and blood flow is the proxy for activity dp and they are the proxy is blood flow or actually 
oxygenation sc okay dp and so that was an interesting technique because you could take completely noninvasively kind of 
imagine you can take a picture inside head from a meter away who knew with a resolution by the 
of about a millimeter these days sc i was gonna ask about the resolution dp the spatial resolution now 
the machines that we use is on the order of a millimeter or sometimes even better there are highresolution 
for instance which is a really pretty substantial magnetic field and you can scan things with a resolution better 
one millimeter which is pretty good but what do you give up for that wonderful picture you give up 
resolution so now you take a really really great picture of head but the dynamics that able to capture 
very very slow what have you given up there well cool picture but nothing about the change or the 
online processing sc and by the way a cubic millimeter brain still has a buttload of neurons in it 
not neuronbyneuron imaging dp a buttload or a shitton it depends on what your units are if you take 
square millimeter of tissue in the brain in the cortex in the cerebral cortex and you look in the 
column above the tissue directly above a square it goes up about three millimeters or so depending on where 
are estimates are that on the order of neurons and just the neurons other junk in there the parts 
of the brain is very complicated lots of little stuff in there we vastly underestimate going on in even 
a cubic millimeter of cortex we have no idea shameful sc but anyway you were mentioning that we also 
pinpoint timing of going on dp yeah here things get interesting because we have say committed to studying the 
brain and stuff you can learn from animal research very important stuff and you can do other kinds of 
that we and should not do with people so there you can use techniques that have even higher spatial 
even higher temporal resolution but except for very extreme medical cases those are not appropriate so we have to 
noninvasive techniques sc talking about things where animals are sacrificing themselves to the cause of science dp yes in 
important ways and if ever gone to the dentist then you should be very grateful for their research this 
a very politically sensitive and complicated topic to what extent do we support animal research enthusiastically in favor of 
responsible ethically executed wellmanaged animal research there is no alternative for it and there are currently wild and scary 
about this in europe in particular more active than in the united states and quite terrible and the debates 
irrational vitriolic and dangerous and they are leading to a sharp reduction in careful animal research of course not 
for as far as concerned say cosmetics or something like that sc shampoos dp shampoos forget that but to 
basic principles of we have no alternative and i think it would be a very peculiar stance not to 
that so much sc but at this point we do not take human subjects and pry open their brains 
look inside dp we do not and we should not there are wonderful new techniques that are used and 
talks about them optogenetics is a particularly exciting one you can treat cells you can inject cells with particular 
molecules such that you can then control their activity but you do that with people you can record single 
in animals but you can only do it under rare conditions in humans for example during epilepsy surgery look 
have noninvasive techniques that are amazing we can take mri pictures of your brain but then sacrificing time and 
you believe time matters how fast do you think our conversation is going dp our conversation if you measured 
the mean rate of speech across languages by the way independent of languages between four and five hertz so 
amplitude modulation of the the signal is a wave you have to imagine that any signal but the speech 
in particular is a wave that just goes up and down in amplitude or informally speaking in loudness the 
goes up and down and the speech signal goes up and down four to five times a second sc 
does the speech signal mean is this what your brain dp the speech signal is the stuff that comes 
of your mouth saying computer is say that was two and a half seconds of speech it came out 
my mouth as a wave form and the wave form that vibrates your eardrum which is cool but if 
look at the amplitude of that wave form signal amplitude going up and down actually this is not debated 
to five times per second this is a fact about the world which is pretty interesting so the speech 
or the socalled modulation spectrum of speech is four to five hertz sc is it very different for different 
dp a good question we know so much about that because nobody localizes as much as we do probably 
little different because it has to do with the cortical processing rate and of course the biomechanics of the 
so likely to be a little different music incidentally has a modulation spectrum little bit slower about two hertz 
to roughly one hundred twenty beats per minute which is pretty cool sc favorite number yeah dp favorite number 
comes out when you do the physics of signals if you take dozens and dozens of hours of music 
you calculate what is the mean across different genres what is the mean rate that the signal goes up 
down two hertz cool fact you should remember it sc science dp science the hell with that one speech 
very fast and in that if our mouth opens four to five times per second not fast enough yet 
of course inside roughly the rate of syllables but syllables have internal structure so that means it must be 
even faster faster than one hundred milliseconds if you really wanna understand going on as stuff comes into your 
whether hearing or vision or touch you need devices that can measure things at the rate of milliseconds or 
of milliseconds or thousands of a second absolutely necessary because the speed at which our mind and our perceptual 
works there are other tools that we sc and an fmri dp an time resolution is on the order 
at best a second but more likely seconds five seconds eight sc so we want a hundredth time improvement 
now we need different machines we have one kind of machine like mri that takes really detailed pictures in 
but has miserable temporal resolution on the other hand there are other tools the most wellknown one is electroencephalography 
around since the and those are electrical techniques they have very good temporal resolution you can measure things at 
outside of the head using electrodes and now you have very very high temporal resolution as high as you 
it depends on your processor say one thousand samples per second so really every millisecond you measure the data 
very low for some processes in physics that would be ultra slow sc zeptoseconds yeah but okay dp yeah 
friends the big deal a few orders of magnitude you wanna have those machines too because you since processing 
fast you wanna be able to understand actually happening at those time scales and for that my own favorite 
is one called a magnetoencephalography and that measures the magnetic fields generated by current flow in your brain and 
most sensitive technique we have to measure the human brain noninvasively it looks like a giant hair dryer and 
giant hair dryer has little end detectors in it typically you see them obviously inside the hair dryer and 
in liquid helium to keep them at superconducting temperature and there are little coils say about one hundred fifty 
them inside surrounding your head and then you can measure the brain activity at say a millisecond resolution and 
as best you can how fast and where things happen you really wanna pair these different techniques if you 
have an increasingly comprehensive thing and i remember not that long ago i stuck you into one of those 
sc in fact i got a lot of mileage out of that dp i stuck your head into an 
machine and we measured your brain response to different tones and a few visual stimuli and it turns out 
brain worked sc you confirmed the existence of my brain i was very happy about that dp so the 
was good all is well sc the internet has mixed reviews on the existence of my brain so i 
glad you could confirm it using science dp we found all the parts and no extra parts sc exactly 
dp so all good sc and i liked it especially because physics right the reason why you could get 
signal is because a thought is manifested by charged particles being dp right sc and where the magnetic field 
from dp amazing again amazing that it works right the fact that we can have a conversation is a 
wave vibrating your ear which turns into electricity in your auditory periphery which sends a signal using a code 
yet understand into different parts of your brain where decoded or represents information using some code that we also 
using electricity which flows around generating magnetic fields wild out there sc you have a lot to do a 
of science left to be done here dp but pretty cool that we can do it at all suggests 
using the insights and tools of physics and the toolbox of physiology is the best way to go if 
have the theory sc there you go dp the other tool you need some ideas sc the next step 
was gonna say we have learned something by doing all these things changed how we think about how language 
processed not just we can do made progress dp made good progress very hard to measure in this area 
research what would constitute compelling progress in what universe would we say cow we have a true sc we 
it once and for all yeah dp and partly that has to do with what do we think is 
explanation and a very complicated concept in its own right whether thinking about it from the point of view 
philosophy the sciences an epistemological idea but we do have what we have for sure is better descriptions if 
better explanations and the descriptions have changed quite a bit i know what the time scale is that would 
as success but i think we can sort of say that had the same paradigm had the same neurobiological 
for about one hundred fifty years since broca and wernicke since the actually a very straightforward sc so older 
electromagnetism dp yes sc the same age dp the and that should worry you sc older than statistical mechanics 
what you should worry about that is that that model is what is that model let me tell you 
idea was well language is some faculty of the mind it lives whatever that means in the left hemisphere 
sc so the model says dp so the model says and a blob on the front part of your 
in the frontal lobe on the left side and another blob of tissue in the posterior part of your 
in the temporal lobe connected by a wire which has the charming name arcuate fasciculus and what you get 
an area for production an area for comprehension and a wire that connects the two and if you go 
couple extra wires but not talked about much if you go to classic neurology textbooks now and if you 
a stroke the chances are probably better than ten to one that the neurologist examining you will refer to 
figure and that model and that really should worry you sc and was that model based on people dissecting 
brains dp that model was based on really in some sense the oldest model in neuroscience it was based 
patient data famously the patient a guy named leborgne or known in the literature as and broca who was 
neurologist in paris examined him tested him behaviorally noticed that this guy say much remarkably a few days after 
gave him a thorough examination the man died and was able to do who knew why did it never 
out that sc yeah well say went and seen your so i think happy that it work out laughter 
they found correlations called deficitlesion correlation so they found a lesion in this brain broca in this case and 
able to correlate it with the particular behavioral deficit he said interesting if this part of the brain is 
and this behavior is broken there must be some kind of causal relationship between a particular brain area and 
function it now a very reasonable hypothesis subject to subtle things one could change about it but it seems 
a good start some years later the german neurologist wernicke made a similar discovery for a different part of 
brain he found patients that had a lesion or a brain injury due to stroke in the posterior part 
the brain and the temporal lobe and that patient or those patients had trouble understanding they could talk they 
very fluent but make any sense so the assumption was so their comprehension part is dp we have a 
part and a comprehension part and so now we have a kind of understanding now the problem with that 
of all not a theory of language for that we had to wait another one hundred years until the 
sciences were more mature and there the work of chomsky in the played an enormous role but for those 
hundred years from one thousand eight hundred sixtyone to say the theory of language that was at the basis 
how we think about brain and language was pretty naive it was something we could come up with right 
with a piece of paper of course amazing how powerful that model was and how hard it was to 
beyond it but now known for sc sorry remind me what about the two blobs connected by the wire 
an area called region area named after the neurologist paul broca an area called region after the neurologist carl 
and then a set of wires really in between called the arcuate fasciculus basically those are literally the wires 
one blob to the other and the idea is sc yeah the role of the two areas dp the 
of the two areas is one is for production and one is for comprehension sc okay got it dp 
simple idea and very elegant very elegant sc if only the world is so simple dp if only the 
were also aligned so models are doomed to be true for a while in this case this is very 
because it has the elegance of simplicity but also is empirically wrong wrong for many reasons patients with the 
lesions turned out not to have those syndromes the brain organization is much more complicated the wiring diagram is 
of times more complicated known for certainly forty years that incorrect and now in the last ten years happy 
say there are a handful of models that really go well beyond that and that show us actually how 
the parts list is and how much more complicated the structure is partly because these contemporary models are much 
in tune with what we know about the biology of the human brain and likewise what we know about 
psychology of human language so they try to link the say models of linguistics and psycholinguistics to models of 
and surely as inadequate but hopefully wrong in an interesting way and they are de facto the state of 
art right now sc one hopes for progress not for definitiveness and especially into the brain dp a nice 
to say it yes look the brain is a complicated place you work on big things really really really 
places the place i work on is small by comparison just the size of two fists really squished together 
being said my small place is pretty complicated sc way more complicated very quick to admit this dp it 
a hundred billion parts so the current estimate for the human brain it has eightysix billion cells and each 
if you think about it in the facebook sense each cell has between one thousand and friends sc are 
really friends though or are they just acquaintances dp are they friends well likes acquaintances how sure are we 
care is out but then if you imagine that of course communicating with each other electrically and chemically the 
complexity of the prop gets out of hand in a hurry this is one of the reasons we really 
the kinds of theories that are successful and adequate at the moment sc right so you are part of 
originator of something called the dualstream model you complicated the simple model a little bit by imagining more than 
thing going on is it possible to simplify that enough to podcast language dp sure of course the correct 
sc of course that we know yeah dp that was an attempt by a colleague of mine greg hickok 
me worked together on this kind of thing for many years trying to bring together data from patients patients 
stroke and imaging and biology and linguistics to come up with a much more say biologically realistic computationally explicit 
theoretically wellmotivated idea and what we really did is we borrowed or say we adopted and adapted the standard 
of vision actually so what do you have to do when you see something the most straightforward way to 
about vision is you have to locate things and then you wanna know what they are dp so a 
and a system and actually not that much of a simplification as it turns out so a whole chunk 
brain the human brain the vertebrate brain has enormous amounts dedicated to the visual system and so an enormous 
dedicated to processes that identify objects the socalled system and they go along as it turns out the temporal 
and their this is sort of the side of the brain under your ears and these series of regions 
which there are dozens actually their job is to extract the information that lets you actually identify things so 
do i know this is a glass of water a glass of wine this is a chair a hawk 
by which you have to identify the object super useful you want that dp however you also want another 
you need to know where is it relative to where you are you need a system that allows you 
instance to regulate your eye movements figure out where reaching to grab something see that sabertoothed tiger is coming 
the left and not the right vision has really worked us out in wonderful detail very very elegant we 
one stream principally responsible for localization information other things as well and a good summary statement and another anatomic 
with subareas responsible for identifying objects very cool idea by the way now bought yourself an interesting problem how 
you put them together sc well i was gonna say that it could have been that there was really 
one system that did both functions but two different systems both operationally but also literally where they are in 
brain the actual neurons doing that dp literally a different stream of information yeah this was discovered a long 
ago in the in the hamster actually this notion of multiple sensory areas and multiple different streams responsible and 
some sense an engineering idea that you then see replicated in the brain you want subspecialization because the circuitry 
these areas really does things optimized for that thing say you wanna really identify an object you wanna have 
high spatial resolution you really wanna be able to see the details analyze its surface make guesses about how 
it is and so on whereas you care so much when you just need to say move your eyes 
the right to run away or something so we basically stole that idea sc in the best scientific tradition 
in the sense of adopting and adapting and said what if the speech and language system actually did something 
that dissimilar capitalizing on similar the visual system is pretty old but pretty useful one of the things you 
to do in the language case is what do you want from the information that you have well one 
the things you want is the content the i need to recognize words i need to string words together 
recognize meaning i need to be able to tell the difference between bites and bites which would be uncool 
yeah i try to stay away from that dp those are the same set of words but they mean 
completely different so you need to in this case the particular ordering has a clear consequence for the interpretation 
we reasoned that maybe the brain capitalizes on the same computational principles you have one stream of information that 
what i really need to do is figure out what am i actually hearing what are the words how 
i put them together and how do i extract meaning from and you have another stream that really needs 
be able to deal with how do i translate that into an output call it a stream or an 
interface dp why would you do such a thing well take the simplest case of a word and so 
word word is not a technical concept by the way word is an informal concept as you remember from 
reading of steve book the technical term here would be morpheme the smallest meaningbearing unit but call them words 
roughly correspond to ideas so what is a word you have a word that comes in my word that 
into your head now is say and as it comes in you have to link that sound file to 
concept in your head it comes in you translate it into a code we know say microsoft brain and 
code then gets linked somehow to the file that is the storage of the word in your head now 
your head somewhere a file an address that says the word what it means for you like on this 
my email but many other things so you know what it means you know how to pronounce it you 
a lot about computers but you also know how to say it so it also has to have an 
code dp now here comes the rub the articulatory code is in a different coordinate system than all the 
ones because in the motor system in basically time and people call it joint space because you move articulators 
you move your jaw your tongue your lips so the coordinate system that you use as a controller is 
different than the other ones you have to have areas of the brain that go back and forth seamlessly 
very quickly because speech is fast between an articulatory coordinate system for speaking and an auditory coordinate system for 
and some coordinate systems yet unspecified which we understand at all for meaning screwed so even something banal like 
the word or or is already a deeply complicated theoretical problem sc in the visual case the dual do 
call that in the visual case dp yeah you simply call it the what and where the dual stream 
simply that you subdivide problems into multiple streams like an engineer would sc but those particular streams are what 
are and where they are and then in the audio case the hearing case what they mean is that 
of the streams dp well say we call an interface to the meaning system say structure and meaning and 
interface to the motor system so we call it sc say the words for example dp we called it 
sound to meaning interface and a sound to articulation interface sc it does sound like a slightly different problem 
the sense that language is where these meanings come from or at least often sometimes we just yelp or 
or whatever but the vision problem seems much more straightforward any vertebrate is gonna know where things are and 
they are we humans have a special problem when it comes to sound which is that we wanna interpret 
in much more abstract ways dp yeah quite true that you wanna overanalogize here and there are aspects of 
which to me seem quite different one of the main things you do in the language case is technically 
to take things and put them together and not so obvious how true in the vision case although it 
be i wanna overstate my case here but the kinds of things you have to do in language and 
are different and certainly the output systems are different so the eye movement system is not like the speech 
or something like that but what you could imagine is that certain of the subroutines that are executed in 
way there are shared for sc a very common evolutionary strategy the brain is always borrowing the body is 
borrowing old systems dp right exactly right you wanna basically recycle stuff one reason that greg hickok and i 
for this particular dual stream ours is now one of a few a handful of these i think there 
of course think ours is still the best although now ten years old by now but de facto one 
tell you a fun sociological story about that in a second one of the things that might be shared 
this notion of a coordinate transformation the reason very attached to this is because the same part of the 
that we argue does this for the language speech case for the speech perception to production sensory motor case 
that you have to do a similar thing in the eye movement case if you take the a simpler 
that everybody can do for themselves right now while listening to this magnificent podcast you have a glass of 
in front of you sc and we do by the way gentle listeners have glasses of wine in front 
us dp which we do and i now really wanna reach for this glass of wine terrific red wine 
the way so what i have to do to execute that ostensibly simple thing the first thing is the 
falls onto my eyeball onto my retina in particular the surface the back of my eye that does the 
encoding so the coordinates of that are retinacentric that is a particular twodimensional sheet and the glass is now 
somewhere on that sheet and the information now goes into my head but now note that i can move 
eyes now no longer in the coordinates of the retina but in the coordinates of the eyeball now i 
move my head i can also move my trunk but in the end what trying to do is reach 
the damn glass of wine so it has to be in coordinates that are relative to my trunk and 
my arm because gonna reach my arm out and it needs to i need to have knowledge of where 
my current position of my hand where does my hand need to be how hard does my hand need 
grasp sc so the simple act of reaching for a glass of wine or a pencil or anything ever 
a series of transformations conceptually it mean doing a series of the equations over there but maybe but you 
to transform the information into a suitable format and so if it comes in in eyecentered coordinates and has 
go out in handcentered or musclecentered coordinates what gives how do you do that that come for free so 
regions of the brain that do that in the posterior part of the parietal lobe but different part more 
the top of your head likely are optimized for that kind of computation and we reasoned look if the 
kind of mathematical problem maybe really well implemented there and maybe the speech problem is similar in kind dp 
obviously the inputs and outputs are quite different gonna get say informally speaking a sound file in and some 
of motor command out but the kind of problem is the same kind of problem and then you have 
have some kind of basis function you have to transform it into a different thing why we borrowed the 
from vision and tried to say this is computationally and why we think this constitutes a form of progress 
we try to be explicit about the set of operations that you really do have to do in order 
achieve ostensibly almost idiotically simple but the bottomline is we do not know how we recognize a single word 
a single object sc i do have a question but first using sociological story you promised me dp okay 
is how science sometimes works and it has funny parts and slightly less amusing parts about or maybe by 
years ago when greg hickok and i started working this out one of the things we argued for was 
dual stream concept and another thing we argued for was that things really are much more bilaterally organized and 
that point we were still extremely young ish younger than now sc now only mostly young dp now a 
more mature so greg and i wrote the stuff up and we sent it the initial reaction to our 
was that we were basically crazy because there was a model from the century it worked it was clinically 
and we were accused of being charlatans and the most naive bunch of yahoos who know the first thing 
any of the relevant disciplines which kind of bummed us out sc yeah dp we were like we were 
reading literature and doing our true that we departed pretty drastically from the standard model at that point but 
thought we were being very motivated by vision thinking about linguistics thinking about the biology of the brain people 
dismissed us as complete nut jobs sc the problem is that people who sound like complete nut if you 
have a tremendously important breakthrough that changes the world you will be told a complete nut job but most 
who sound like complete nut jobs do not have tremendously important breakthroughs that will change the world dp yeah 
thought we were being pretty careful in our reasoning of course our feelings because we were young we were 
i think assistant professors at that point and our feelings were hurt understandably but then people started saying maybe 
so the data started amassing and the people started really thinking about it and reading it and paid a 
of attention to this thing and now ten years or fifteen years later become more or less a standard 
and now it is the textbook model but now ironically all the young people stand up and basically take 
at us about how naive and how we never had the good years sc you never worked the fee 
dp initially we were the cranks who just know and now just the old guard who just really on 
cutting edge sc outdated even before you were accepted dp so sometimes we a little wistfully think we ever 
a break sc the answer is you do not get a dp you do not get a break obviously 
that people are interested in this but it would have been nice to have two years where people say 
you nice idea probably wrong but good for sc i know it well but thinking is there an obstacle 
understanding both vision and auditory signals that we kind of in the back of our minds know a little 
too much about how computers work when we take a picture with a camera we have pixels and we 
just data of where things are and what color they are and the brain is much more based on 
from incomplete data both in speech and in vision is that getting in the way of solving this important 
of how we go from the basic input stream to the meaning inside dp well i think not quite 
to say the pixel or camera metaphor for vision is also wrong just as hearing and language comprehension is 
constructive process so is vision sc no in the brain it is yeah saying for a camera not dp 
a camera not so taking the camera analogy we wanna take that too far what we do know and 
effectively since i wanna say helmholtz but probably earlier sc helmholtz yes dp helmholtz is always right about most 
sc yes dp a good line by i wanna say david hubel the nobel laureate winning neuroscientist who discovered 
principles of the early visual cortex he and torsten wiesel won the nobel prize in i think i vaguely 
hearing this in the lecture that david hubel gave many years ago most of what we do are footnotes 
helmholtz sc very nice dp which i thought was demoralizing but pretty cool sc you know line that is 
footnotes to dp yes sc where he got this dp i think the notion that entirely constructed that you 
a computational theory using the word but loosely i think is now completely convincing that the way we do 
are predictive for instance that most of what we do is a prediction that the data that you get 
vastly underdetermined the percepts and experience that you extract from the initial data and so that a filling in 
so you take underspecified data that are probably noisy anyway and then you build an internal representation that you 
for inference and you use for action those are the two things you presumably wanna do most you wanna 
run into things and you wanna think about stuff there i sc story of my life not running the 
and thinking about stuff dp yeah we all have the same issue there sc i often succeed dp better 
i do i make both mistakes i think poorly i think that there is for many years the this 
brings us back to what talking about earlier the influence of chomsky and mentalism was the embracing of what 
and still is called the computational theory of mind very influential i think people like fodor played an enormous 
in this and sc jerry fodor the philosopher dp the philosopher jerry fodor and then subsequently people like dan 
picked it up de facto as far as i can tell the most reasonable way to think about the 
there are no alternatives i find even vaguely credible not that not all over the interwebs sc you can 
them the brain yeah dp but these so these are what has made this helpful is the requirement to 
things explicit and sort of to think a little bit like a program really spell out what in some 
taking work on the mind and brain which i take to be particularly different just like any other discipline 
or physics that is to say your first job is to identify the parts list what is the ontological 
of your domain are actually the is my call or just like to get the parts less complicated sounding 
are the smallest elements that you need to use to generate the phenomena and then you need to identify 
forces or the interactions between the primitives that generate the phenomena under study and the computational theorists might have 
very good about that dp obviously one can do better because we what the primitives are is a research 
just like in physics it takes decades and decades we know what the smallest pieces are it turns out 
be really difficult every time we look a little bit smaller changed a little bit or for example now 
you ask someone what do you think is the relevant part of the gonna say a like a nice 
but maybe a subpart of a subpart of a or it could turn out that gonna be five neurons 
up a certain way namely two are capacitor and who the hell knows we simply know what the encoding 
information is sc well even for the neurons progress in the sense i get the impression that at some 
in the history of psychology it was thought that the brain was a bunch of blobs interacting with each 
and just the progress that has been made by thinking of it as a network of neurons and not 
connected to each other equally some hierarchical structure there dp that brings a very interesting and a slightly dodgy 
nobody would argue that the network metaphor necessary and important research agenda that being said that just kicking the 
down the and before you said this part of tissue and we now you say five pieces of tissue 
a bunch of wires interacting and we understand so simply saying a is kind of punting on the problem 
me sc a tiny little thing i definitely get that yes dp it is look all on board with 
obviously everybody agrees a super complicated dynamic system with many interacting parts trying to just figure out how the 
highdimensional dynamics of the things work but to me not a mechanistic answer a metaphoric a metaphor not a 
to say a network sc well how far there has been progress made how far does that get us 
the stated goal of understanding what happens when we hear words like or words that are not referring to 
out there that we can point that abstract concepts dp very difficult question the vast majority of standard work 
we say refers to say the socalled items or nouns and verbs chairs and dogs and bears and things 
that sc no bears yet by the way dp no bears although some deer often over there maybe i 
them to new york so the issue of abstraction is particularly difficult because you no longer wanna deal with 
like this concept has a bunch of features that make and these necessary insufficient features make you a member 
the category honesty now there are such ideas namely the concept of embodied cognition very very popular these days 
psychology and neuroscience i say that i find it coherent but it certainly be my guest and work it 
and then watch the movie all good but it gets even more gnarly when you think not just about 
concepts back up for one second how does thought partition roughly you might say there are concrete things that 
think about like dogs cats and and the untutored intuition says those are the easy yeah not easy either 
there are abstract things sc but is it that not easier or just not easy dp not easy and 
easier no reason to believe that the way we understand is easier than the way we understand sc okay 
i have no reason to believe that sc all right dp so we have intuitions that sc my cat 
not understand honesty at all i know that but i know if helpful dp your cat also understand cat 
sc cat right dp there are of course in our world concrete things that we reason about there are 
things that we make inferences about but then there are the real juicy bits which is the small list 
words in all our language socalled items that make it all worthwhile namely things like and where the fun 
and those are the ones you really wanna understand because actually the glue that holds the stuff together you 
unless aphasic actually what you really say is i want that quinoa pasta glutenrich sc often said those words 
but sounding pessimistic sounding well at dp well no trying to sound realistic about sc realistic about the current 
dp trying to say not pessimistic about i think made wonderful progress and i think repiecing the stuff slowly 
but a okay what optimistic and pessimistic about optimistic about that we can get a grip on say in 
next ten years call them rules or operations or computations that put items together to yield larger items the 
that a red can for instance is a can and not a red how did you know that that 
from first principles you have to actually figure that out right not a but my hunch is that these 
operations of composition or combinatorics that yields larger units that then become the input to the next steps actually 
optimistic about that gonna get a grip on that believe it or not dp what much more not pessimistic 
just kind of bewildered about and stuff that i think giving me stuff that i think about a lot 
how do you store anything to begin if i say great but where is red where is can and 
to put together sc like literally located in the brain dp literally located in the brain such the remarkable 
is as we talked about earlier say you have or ubereducated so you probably have things in your head 
in sc many of them are silly and useless dp many of them useless but even the useless ones 
at the rate that our conversation is happening and we said four to five hertz is a typical syllable 
that means we speak something between three to five words per second super fast it means at that time 
you have to translate the information coming into the periphery into the correct code go into your bag of 
pull out the correct item not the wrong item pretty good compared to machines unbelievably robust and resilient in 
and all kind of stuff pull out the right item and keep doing that sequentially put them together with 
next one and also with ones that are distant and get the correct interpretation out at a subsecond scale 
the time the operations that happen pretty optimistic about that we get a grip on because i think wonderful 
happening of that in many different labs but the process of the identification of how we actually store not 
words but anything at all is to me deeply puzzling and i think is one of the deepest mysteries 
neuroscience sc i would have thought at the most naive level again perhaps being misled by the analogy with 
that information is stored in individual neurons as some bits somewhere like a computer memory my understanding is that 
is wrong and neuroscientists will tell me that closer to being stored in the connections between the neurons but 
gonna tell me that we even know that dp yeah absolutely right i much prefer your first story that 
say that maybe things are stored inside cells or the structures of cells or even possibly the genome that 
be the really interesting case sc how do you color red i can learn the color red and it 
be stored in my genome dp well why do you have all the introns for we know but look 
standard story is the one you just said our standard story in memory right now is the connections between 
cells the synaptic structure and the synaptic connectivity is what reflects memory of something and the modification of that 
between cells is effectively what learning means so learning means a modification a cellular a molecular level modification and 
a genetic level modification sc and nobel prizes have been given out for these discoveries dp numerous yes the 
one perhaps kandel most famously for this the synaptic pattern of things is the basis of this and this 
the standard story but when you start to dig in a little bit and i think the most say 
critic is randy gallistel from rutgers a very distinguished psychologist and cognitive scientist worked most of his life on 
and from a computational point of view has written a very very fascinating book called and the computational and 
bunch of papers which he basically pulls the rug out from under neuroscience of memory and says show me 
least how you store the number seventeen or something or anything for that matter any bit of information and 
is it how is it done and then how is it actually implemented when you use it how do 
so we have intuitions that yes the pattern of connectivity may be activated or deactivated but you really need 
kind of digital storage device the issue very tricky in memory is on the one hand the way human 
works is certainly content addressable we know that for words for instance content addressable in the sense if i 
you think nurse or toothache or whatever the appropriate semantic field is that that associates with you what content 
is a contentbased cloud of ideas but you also want what a computer has which is address addressability you 
to a location and you pull something out and so how do is that possible can we put things 
how would we store in a digital of format the digital information we have how do we actually compute 
with variables dp take the wonderful examples from the animal world the tunisian desert ant cataglyphis it lives in 
desert tunisia flat not much to see no visual cues the ant comes out of burrows in comes out 
has to walk around to find say a leaf so the ant has these ants are small not huge 
the ant walks around walks around meandering maybe a meter or two meters finds a bit of leaf how 
the ant walk back straight back to its hole how dp how does the ant know how to do 
okay how would you do that so have to figure out a bit of math you have to figure 
wait wait a here is a simple one that does it like hansel and gretel so it leaves a 
bit of chemical trail but if it did that it would wander back the same path it do that 
actually takes a straight vector back and then looks for its hole so it must have first of all 
out how far it went it has to count the steps or something which it turns out it does 
has to keep track of time because at that point the sun has of course changed position so it 
the solar ephemeris function dp so you need to actually have an equation in your head in which you 
in the value of variables that you then calculate in order to say have to go back south by 
in ye much whatever four now a kind of simple example well attested in beautiful experiments by the way 
a kind of compelling and very clear case where a small nervous system has to does a very simple 
namely finding your home after walking out but in order to do that it has to plug a value 
a variable so how do you do sc a little bit abstract right there dp now things get a 
dodgy sc many junior high school students struggle with this dp do not enjoy this concept sc right dp 
so how does the little tiny brain have represented a variable that then is able to take a specific 
then do its little calculation and say going that sc is this the experiment where they put the little 
on stilts dp that is exactly one of them yeah a whole bunch of experiments these are mostly by 
wehner from zurich beautiful beautiful experiments sc and when they were on stilts they got the wrong answer they 
the number of steps but they understand how far they were going dp exactly right so that was the 
that you have a counter because if too high and you take the number you would go too far 
it makes such a compelling case for a simple kind of computation so if the ant does that it 
impossible there are circuitry in a small brain that allows you to have variablebased computation now if you attribute 
to the ant do you not attribute it to the vertebrate sc right right dp that seems weird to 
sc and hinting that this might be part of the origin of abstraction the way they do computation dp 
too far i would like to me a reminder that one of the things we have to have an 
for is say algebraic computation sc right yeah so actually good to have a tractable goal okay if we 
understand that which in some primitive sense even ants can do it be nice dp yeah it gives a 
the kind of problem that language faces too for instance one of the interesting things about language processing is 
the socalled property of structure dependence one of the things that makes computers different from human brains for the 
part is that the way that language works across all languages not a string of pearls but more like 
alexander calder mobile it has relationships that are dependent on where in a structure things are not just in 
sequence so not just i have a sentence that has seven words one two three four five six seven 
a row and it matters what does your neighbor your but it matters what their structural relation is and 
evidence for this this is not debated notion that means you have to have some kind some people give 
a tree structure because a good way to visualize it other people are deeply offended by trees and they 
you have trees living in the but just a notational variant you can express that many different ways sc 
them networks people will love it dp call them networks or it can be bracketing like in a burr 
whatever you can call it whatever you want just that their relations are nonlocal and a really deep property 
you have to be able to deal with nonlocal relationships the most obvious example is how do you deal 
say pronouns and the thing that they refer to the socalled antecedents say was finished with his recording and 
asked me to give him another glass of what is the that could be sean but that could be 
else it could be some other him it could not be me but how do you know that off 
fly it knows because actually a structural relationship between the pronoun and the antecedent if you use that it 
only these are trivial examples but they highlight a very special property namely the property of commonly called that 
are constituents constituents are just equivalence classes constituents when i sc core screenings dp yeah red can was on 
then the red can is a constituent because i could say transparent glass was so i can substitute for 
else and the fact that you have such things and that they have of course causal force in how 
say stuff suggests that they must be in your head somehow unless you are a dualist fine too sc 
not no we want to be dualists here okay dp not okay with that it work for me sc 
of my best friends are dualists if you have a brain with eightyfive billion neurons in it and as 
said each neuron has thousands of friends so lots of connections a gigantic computational problem as you said even 
most functional level for getting around meaning and abstraction and poetry and music if physicists were in charge of 
just be throwing gigantic computer power at it and treating as a big data problem and i do get 
impression this is happening also in neuroscience dp absolutely right i think that there were many of us maybe 
of us are seduced by the power by the computational power now available everybody and their brother has some 
gpu in their laptop it is changing ways in interesting ways maybe good maybe bad the fact of the 
is the data sizes that we now collect the data amounts are extremely large true so when i stick 
i put you in a magnetoencephalography scanner so we recorded for say ten minutes about two gigabytes of data 
lot of data and so obviously you need to automatize the analysis needed to figure something out dp but 
comes a very important epistemological choice that you have to make is do you approach these data call well 
old school with the hypothesis like you learned laughter do you actually have an idea were you looking for 
did you design what you did with a particular thing in mind do you have a hypothesis a model 
theory which is a very baconian and boring but has done pretty well the last few hundred years not 
lie or do you do you pursue a data driven or big data approach thing and very popular because 
can we have machines that do well and you certain problems are say at least descriptively reasonably well addressed 
simply classifying things if you have a classification problem then big data is a cool approach you train your 
on gazillions of trials and then you throw some new data on it and maybe you have even an 
learning situation and you get beautiful clusters of things out of them and i think very powerful and not 
lie we use that in my lab sc and looking for correlations also dp and you basically be clear 
you take this approach looking at an orgy of data almost treated hypothesis free purely correlational approach basically the 
of all regressions so what might happen in one universe you might get lucky it might turn out that 
regression you build the giant correlation matrix which is obscenely large turns out to give you an interesting fractionation 
factorization of the problem but what are the chances laughter it could happen but a lot of data weird 
messy and noisy a lot of weird things could happen dp tell you not against this at all against 
more data kinda silly but the question is how do you approach these data collected and i guess very 
in my own lab we have vitriolic energetic debate i love everybody in my lab wonderful people but we 
agree and i have lab members that are strongly pushing me on this and strongly pushing back and i 
a really good idea to design the experiment with a question in mind if i stick you in a 
and gonna spend a lot of money energy and time on recording these really quite sophisticated complicate data i 
know what looking for a very very big version of this is the large hadron collider you build that 
just because you say shit just correlate a bunch of sc oh no but exactly the same debate is 
on between targeted searches and blank searches for some anomaly in something somewhere dp yeah interesting how you might 
it sympathetic to finding things by serendipity but my own feeling is still that are from my own hunches 
actually a very wellarticulated model that can then be shown to be wrong reduces the nature of the problem 
simply not satisfied by some giant correlation matrix or the answer a regression those are engineering solutions in my 
i told you before my gut feeling is that in the neurosciences in the summer of engineering approaches and 
data approaches are actually replacing the standard approach of the sciences and a little weird that engineering is superseding 
science sc but is it a temporary enthusiasm that we dp well all enthusiastic cool to be able to 
at gigantic amounts of things but here is the danger the danger is that we end maybe not a 
maybe just an old guy sc maybe dp an old angry guy i think the potential danger is that 
become theoretically myopic that is to say the kinds of answers that are yielded by this approach are of 
certain form and we will only be getting that form of answer the form of answer that comes out 
giant regressions and that may be theoretically misleading that is we might have a generation of science in which 
answers that are provided us come from that kind of epistemological stance and prevent us from seeing theoretical alternatives 
are not fully aligned with that approach which i think would be a huge bummer sc so ironically by 
having a theoretical framework with which to analyze and construct the experiment locking yourself into certain possible things you 
dp right sc and refusing to look for other ones dp yeah so working on this problem with one 
my colleagues right now the way trying our diagnosis of this is not at all against using huge amounts 
data exciting but our diagnosis suppose you run a big data approach on a neuroscience problem say i wanna 
spoken word recognition something i actually know something a little bit about and what gonna do is gonna record 
just gonna have a thousand people listen to words some giant data gonna crank this thing through my convolutional 
network and then gonna get some interesting classification scheme out of it and i can probably record in different 
sc so looking at what happens in the brain when listening to these words just gonna look for correlations 
and just gonna record this and just gonna take these data and gonna correlate everything with everything and of 
some correlations will come out great now say i end up with a very good model a terrific model 
and that model will be characterized by a series of parameters and gonna be great and say it has 
different things that i had to tweak awesome now i have a fantastic model and i have these fourteen 
got a kappa you gotta have a kappa sc okay maybe a tau always good lambda dp lambda is 
gotta get a couple of lambda is good okay now i have these parameters that i fixed and they 
the optimal thing what do i my next step my next step presumably is to do on what these 
are so i now have just bit myself in the butt i have to say i have these fourteen 
now i have to actually figure out what they are because they are the ones that are ostensibly the 
have the force of being explanatory for the model what i think fine our argument is that this is 
lovely approach but in the end gonna actually reinvent what you have to do to begin with to give 
full comprehensive explanatory account of the parameters of your machinelearned models sc so you think that still room for 
thought and language in trying to understand human thought and language dp i think you need you need just 
sense sc yeah dp a solid common sense no bullshit have a good bullshit detector sc and read all 
details of the papers dp and worry and it turns out you have to actually do the homework you 
to do the homework sc do the homework all right good advice like to leave on a good advice 
i do better than the david poeppel thank you very much for being on the podcast dp thank you 
now this is an interesting episode thank you very much for making this podcast series free the transcript is 
the talk was good too btw at in the transcript it should be not it would be nice if 
transcript was shown in an area of the web page that scrolls separately from the podcast control as it 
now to resync after an interruption is somewhat of a chore very interesting and thanks a lot for transcription 
non native english speaking people like me i have one question i wish to investigate using psychoanalysis in myself 
do not know yet if feasible whatever structure the brain have for recognizing word and meaning of received sounds 
whatever for producing speech or written ideas and concepts my opinion is that there is not let say a 
thoughts to verbally developed ideas actually the language is the brain structure of discursive thoughts there are not discursive 
i mean verbal constructions without language yes there are other types of thoughts images artistic general undeveloped ideas unreal 
like the ones in dreams and so on so the language structure is the brain structure of the discursive 
both are the same is this might be somehow proven it has a tremendous impact in philosophy thinking of 
and in its relation with external hi sean love the podcast this was one of my favorite episodes so 
i especially enjoyed the discussion near the end about the ever evolving methods in science however i will point 
that unfortunately david has his history and exactly backwards at thanks to the transcript he mentions having hypothesis a 
a as and that the datadriven approach is new and different the very boring but trustworthy hypothesismodeltheory approach is 
more of a popperian methodology where experiments are run only after forming a theory which makes certain falsifiable predictions 
datadriven approach is in fact actually more in line with what bacon envisioned in his bacon suggests a division 
labor amongst scientists where some go out and gather data and observations premature reflection or any great some others 
that data and then still others try to formulate some theory based on those observations laura franklinhall explores these 
differences in a short paper called linked below which looks at some case studies in biology and the various 
made available by something she calls but the same sort of thing could be said about the new approaches 
possible by having powerful computers and massive quantities of data would still be an inappropriate term for the types 
datadriven experiments mentioned by david because presumably those researchers are bring a large amount of background theory to bear 
which problems they investigate something which was lacking from original formulation of minions scouring the earth and collecting whatever 
they happen upon it change any of subsequent discussion about the fruitfulness of engineeringtype approaches which i thought was 
on i just wanted to point out the history housekeeping suggestion standardize the metadata if the proper term when 
download these sometimes sometimes carroll scientist and there are other mismatches and my phone cope the podcasts end up 
different automatically generated folders for artists genres playlists etc i appreciate not the most urgent issue facing mankind but 
would be handy and thanks comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers science
