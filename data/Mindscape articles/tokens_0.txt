mindscape podcast your host sean carroll longtime listeners will know that one of the topics very interested in here 
the podcast is thinking rationality how human beings cogitate to make decisions about the world and even longer term 
will know that i love using the game of poker as a model for thinking about human rationality sc 
course poker is a very finite welldefined game you know what the rules are you know what the rewards 
but it models a lot of the circumstances that are very important when making hard decisions in our everyday 
poker is a game of incomplete information we know what our opponents have a game where randomness involved you 
what the next card is going to be a game where there probably is a strategy which will at 
guarantee you lose over the long term but you might not know what that strategy is you have to 
a good bayesian you have to do your best to model your other opponents etcetera sc and perhaps most 
all poker is a game where even if you know cognitively consciously what the best strategy is sometimes it 
be hard to obey to follow that best strategy you can be what in poker terms is called your 
can get in the way and your rationality can suffer thereby sc so the perfect person to talk about 
these ideas with is maria konnikova guest maria got her phd in psychology at columbia university starting with walter 
who was very famous for the marshmallow test you know when you give a small child a marshmallow and 
them if they can avoid eating it while you step out of the room and the claim is that 
or not the kids can avoid just eating the marshmallow predicts success later in life sc but maria decided 
to go the academic route instead becoming a writer and she became a very successful staff writer at the 
yorker and then decided that what she really needed to do was up her rationality game and the best 
to do that was to learn to play poker and not because she was a poker hobbyist she literally 
she says know how many cards there were in the deck but on the basis of her psychology degree 
her work as a writer she managed to convince erik seidel who is one of the leading poker players 
coach her with the idea that she would get good enough to play in the world series of poker 
turns out she did way better than that not only did she appear in the world series won hundreds 
thousands of dollars playing poker joined team pokerstars as a poker ambassador and has been very successful overall in 
tournament circuit all of the stories told and the lessons for rationality psychology and human life are summarized in 
new book the biggest bluff how i learned to pay attention master myself and win sc i think that 
podcast is not about poker really we use poker as an example but not teaching you how to play 
not gonna learn how frequently to threebet or whether you should worry about getting check raised or anything like 
about human beings how they think how they reason and in the laboratory of playing poker so learn a 
about human beings maybe even be inspired to go play a few hands of poker while at it sc

with the mindscape podcast i hope that this podcast is doing its tiny little part to keep us all 
and distracted from going on all around us and with that go music sc maria konnikova welcome to the 
podcast maria konnikova thank you so much for having me sean sc so i guess the obvious question is 
have a phd in psychology you have a staff writer job with one of the most prestigious publications in 
world what is it that inspired you to say to yourself know what i really wanna do is to 
poker at a high mk this was not something i had ever seen coming and had you asked me 
years ago you ever be a professional poker player will you ever be playing poker on any level my 
would have been ha because not a lifelong passion of mine not like been poker player from childhood playing 
my friends playing with my family which a lot of professional poker players did do by the way if 
look at a lot of their stories you see that they started when they were absurdly young not my 
what brought me to poker was actually just a completely tangential direction mk my last book had come out 
confidence game and it was doing well i was doing a lot of media for the book everything was 
and then a few months after the book came out a lot of things just all of a sudden 
wrong all at once i had a major health problem that has still not been diagnosed it was some 
of autoimmune thing where all of my hormones just went completely out of whack and i became allergic to 
everything sc oh my goodness mk like i wear clothes basically and yeah it was pretty bad my body 
just break out in hives randomly i visited all these specialists no one knew what was going on and 
lasted for quite some time i was just on these horse doses of steroids and eventually it went away 
to this day we have no idea what happened mk then my grandmother died and it was very sudden 
a total freak accident my mom lost her job my husband lost his job just all of these things 
one after the other after the other and none of them are things that we really have any control 
and it really made me just pause and start questioning you know what do we really control what role 
chance play in everyday life and i decided that what i wanted to write about that i wanted to 
a book about this but as you know written books not really a topic for a book sc right 
just sc a theme yeah mk grand inquiry into the nature of chance and not schopenhauer not gonna do 
philosophical treatise so i started reading about chance and someone said interested in chance you should check out game 
because actually a way to look at chance in a really organized so i started reading john von theory 
games john von neumann is the father of game theory and learned that he was not just a poker 
but that poker was the inspiration for game theory and that von neumann very strongly believed that poker was 
a really wonderful match for strategic decision making in life in general as a game of incomplete information and 
was the game that most fascinated him because he really love chess he thought that it was boring because 
it was very solvable there was always a right move and a wrong move sc right mk and he 
gambling he hated casino games like roulette etcetera because not solvable at all just gambling but poker he felt 
kind of inbetween where you had incomplete information but you could very strategically make good decisions but all the 
there quite a solution so he said gonna solve i started becoming fascinated by is this poker thing why 
someone as brilliant as von neumann think that this held the key to so and so i started reading 
poker and some light went off and that brought me to the biggest bluff i decided know what this 
gonna be the book gonna learn to play poker gonna get someone really good to coach me gonna immerse 
in it and see what and of course i could never have predicted that i would have actually become 
and gone pro that was not part of the plan it was supposed to be just a oneyear immersion 
it went in a very different direction sc and not only did you come from not having grown up 
poker but you literally according to the book anyway know how many cards were in a deck mk oh 
is true that is a true story in my first meeting with erik seidel one of the best players 
the world and became my coach my mentor and now is just a good friend we met over breakfast 
he was very hesitant because he coach people never coached people before and what intrigued him was that i 
poker player coming in to him looking to get better i was someone with a clean slate and he 
just how clean when i said i know some things like i know that there are fiftyfour cards in 
and he just kind of looked at me and i said did i say something funny did i say 
chuckle and he to this day he will not let me live that down and he just jokes over 
over he says know one day those jokers will jump out of the deck and that will be your 
to sc there are fiftytwo cards in the deck for those of the audience members who are not themselves 
players or card players yeah the jokers count but yeah heard also the story of von neumann one of 
great mathematicians and physicists of the century and his interest in mixed games and the balance between randomness and 
but your interest i guess at the time at least at the beginning was like you said not to 
the best poker player but to sort of think of poker as teaching you something about life more generally 
that safe to say mk yes exactly right i wanted to use poker as a kind of metaphor for 
to really think through how do we figure out what that line is between what we can control the 
we can control and the things we the cards the outcome the other players kind of the things that 
necessarily have direct control over as time went on i actually realized that in some ways poker was a 
better metaphor for life than i could have ever imagined and that it was also a perfect learning laboratory 
i came from an academic background i have a phd not just in psychology but i studied the psychology 
decisionmaking specifically under conditions of risk and uncertainty sc wow mk which is very similar to a poker environment 
what we do as psychologists is we identify all of these problems all of the ways that people screw 
when making decisions the way that irrational but there that many solutions i mean even someone like daniel kahneman 
won a nobel prize for his work in this and if anyone knows decision biases kahneman but even he 
that he still exhibits a lot of the same biases and that really really hard to fight them and 
i started playing poker i had this light bulb moment when i realized this is actually a perfect way 
work through these biases and emerge on the other side a better less biased decisionmaker because poker actually forces 
to sample probabilities over and over and over and you get to learn what does feel like what does 
like you get sc exactly mk learn all of these things that in daytoday life we never get to 
and so it forces you to be more precise in your thinking and it does so in an environment 
not life life is messy life is noisy noisy feedback you can always say not my fault the fault 
this or and poker is much cleaner because a game simpler and so you can actually work through a 
of these kinks and what i found as i started playing was that all of a sudden i was 
better decisions away from the poker table even when my poker playing was still not very good sc well 
thought very interesting at the end of the book you mentioned that nassim taleb of black swan fame thinks 
the kind of thing doing by learning poker and imagining you can apply it to real life is not 
good idea because he thinks that the games are too simple to model reality mk absolutely he calls it 
ludic fallacy and he says do this a and whenever you have a nassim taleb fallacy you have to 
of start saying chuckle am i screwing up am i doing something and i think that absolutely right that 
is too simple not life but i think that where its strength lies because you can test out so 
without the fear of the worst possible outcome because the worst possible outcome in poker is that you go 
again if playing cash however much you bought in for that you lose it all if a crazy gambler 
might actually go broke but probably unless involved with some shady elements not gonna die sc yeah hopefully chuckle 
hopefully we hope and only so much that can happen not like life where anything can happen at any 
moment and so i think that that frees you up to explore to actually explore different elements of how 
can be you can learn what does it feel like to be more aggressive what does it feel like 
do this you can experiment you can kind of play around with that you can play around with different 
and you can see the immediate feedback in a way that you often get a chance to see in 
so i think the simplicity actually makes it a much more powerful teaching tool and one that ultimately can 
incredibly applicable to life because of the fact that stripped from a lot of those externalities that we experience 
any other situation that is messy i totally agree with taleb that life is messy that again model it 
but i just see that as a drawback i see it as a strength sc yeah no as a 
completely on your side in this difference because of course you look at simplified spherical cow models to get 
of a feeling for the basics and then you can try to tweak it and try to apply it 
the messy real world and the thing that fascinates people about poker is just like von neumann would have 
in that balanced region where there is randomness you just help it you can do everything right and lose 
the variance is large but also clearly skill right and you can see that certain people who keep appearing 
the circle in these mk absolutely absolutely and the way that i actually explain to people who think so 
and i say not a gambler a poker player two very different things and poker is a game of 
the way that i explain the difference between gambling even like blackjack where you can have a mathematical edge 
still gambling and poker is that in poker i can have the best hand and lose and i can 
the worst hand and win and a very skillful element and in no other game in the casino is 
the case and so that to me is just the epitome of skill and sure in the short term 
is huge i could sit down with the best player in the world and beat him and not because 
the best player in the world because i got very very lucky but if that same player and i 
to play together four hundred hours hours hours the longer the horizon the more clear it becomes that they 
the better player i get lucky over the long term the variance is going to catch up with me 
yeah and i think that i like the example that you give that human beings are bad at randomness 
should talk a lot about the different biases that people have we make mistakes in trying to be rational 
the time and poker does sort of make us face up to them but one of them is this 
in understanding what means like you said i remember even in the last election when people like nate silver 
saying donald trump has a chance of winning and then he won and people said you see he was 
chance that clinton was gonna but chances happen all the time i mean even chances happen all the time 
mk absolutely absolutely huge huge people gave nate so much crap for that and i wanted to say look 
how good his model i mean enormous sc enormous mk just i mean is a hop skip and a 
from thirty to sc right mk and people i think one of the other things that poker has really 
me is that is to be more comfortable with uncertainty because the human this is something that talked about 
lot something that as a psychologist i focus on a lot the human mind just hates uncertainty very averse 
it we like to resolve it we like to be in this gray world we like black and white 
like yes and no we like to put labels on things we like to be sure of something mk 
because my last book was about con artists and the way that con artists often get people to fall 
what selling is they give them certainty they give them actually a story that makes sense they give them 
that makes sense when people want them they tell them what they want to hear and just not the 
the world works uncertainty is a huge part of everyday life and we never know everything and poker just 
going to be good at poker you have to become comfortable in the world of uncertainty you have to 
comfortable knowing that never going to have all of the information and that can a scary thing a scary 
in a lot of ways sc and probably well aware of this from your psychology background but one of 
things human beings like to do is after the fact they will come up with a story to why 
thing had to happen if whatever happened was just sort of predestined and hard to just say the way 
cookie crumbled that particular mk absolutely absolutely we have so much hindsight bias in the way that we analyze 
that one of the things that i learned while playing poker that then applied to other areas of life 
i really just encourage people to do if they want to make better decisions is keep track of your 
in the moment so that you have a tool to protect yourself against hindsight bias so for instance when 
and i know that going to have to talk through a hand with my coach i think through my 
raising here because x y and and i have to keep that in mind it not only forces me 
slow down and actually think through this decision and be reflective about it rather than reflexive about it and 
do it because this seems like a good place to mk but then it also gives me something to 
back to and say i make the decision for the right because if the decision worked out so easy 
say of course i made it right for the right chuckle mk and so powerful to do that because 
life we so often just say well i knew that but i did it because of blah blah and 
know that actually rewriting history sc all the time mk yep sc and one of the things that von 
proved not gonna get exactly the theorem correctly but a game like poker does have an optimal strategy it 
a strategy where in principle if you played this way no one else would consistently beat you but no 
knows what that is so we have on the one hand the sort of mathy problem of in one 
what should you do if you were perfectly rational and then we have the psychology problem of i bring 
to be perfectly rational in this and how do you balance trying to learn those two things mk yeah 
difficult thing to balance and i think there yet i know when be there yet one of the things 
i love is that to this day von neumann was so far ahead of his time but to this 
poker been solved sc right mk go has been solved so many things have and poker i actually talked 
some ai researchers while i was researching the book to get a sense of what they were thinking and 
had no idea i knew that there were ai teams working on no limit hold but i know that 
was actually the paragon of ai problems that it was what people used to test ais against to try 
see how does this work and even when they can get something close it breaks down multiway against many 
because as you were saying there is this problem of how rational do i wanna be a constantly moving 
because different to say be and to say going to mk right you want to play so if you 
who playing against the best strategy for you is not the game theoretical optimal strategy because you want to 
exploiting the weaknesses in the people playing against mk absolutely absolutely but if playing against someone also very good 
who understands that then they might start exploiting you in turn and you just have this constant dance back 
forth and then you start thinking did they do this so that i would start exploiting because they knew 
would so that then they could put me in this horrible situation where going to counter exploit me much 
sc right mk and just this constant iterative analysis why so human why so difficult why so fascinating and 
in the end sc and the particular way that we fail to be rational at the poker table is 
going on tilt right when something happens to you and the poker players know that sometimes not at your 
and i i think even though a big fan of poker and read lots of books about it yours 
have been the first book that pointed out you can go on tilt in a positive way like things 
going too well for you and you become to think that a genius as well as things are going 
and you just become bitter mk yeah absolutely people do tend to think of tilts in a negative way 
i think the reason that i was able to or that i thought of it in a much broader 
is that because my background just decisionmaking my advisor in graduate school was walter mischel who people might know 
the marshmallow guy he was the man who had the bing marshmallow studies how long can you wait for 
marshmallow and he followed these preschool kids for decades and showed that the amount of time that they waited 
predicted a lot of other things in life and he called this delay of gratification and i was last 
student and i had a chance to work with some of the old bing students and to learn a 
about what selfcontrol looks like and what emotion looks like and what tilt even though i know the word 
at the a beautiful word right sc perfect yeah mk i feel like we should use it in every 
so good and it can be so evocative and it can be used in as every single part of 
which i love a perfect four letter word laughter mk but anyhow after that ode to the word tilt 
saw that it could that that emotionality could be from a very positive source not that the kids were 
at the marshmallow or whatever it was they wanted it was wonderful they craved it it was a very 
emotion but it impaired their thinking and impaired their decisionmaking because they were in such an excited state so 
i learnt the notion of tilt i was already looking to see well i know that emotions can actually 
positive and negative and if an emotion and if an emotion incidental rather than central to this decision then 
to make me less mk and then going to make me take a decision make a judgment that i 
make because relying on an emotion that has nothing to do with it and so in poker when most 
think tilt they think the angry the person losing and just getting mad at everyone and fuming and who 
says fine you bully me around anymore watch but also the player who is winning and who thinks this 
amazing like can do no as you said a people always become geniuses when winning sc oh yeah mk 
they just they know everything and so if making decisions because you think on a roll or if making 
because you feel like owed the chips because just going your way and so you say just gonna call 
these two cards because hitting if you start making decisions like that also on tilt because also no longer 
through things in a rational way and letting completely incidental things color how processing the current situation just like 
have a memory your stack of poker chips have a memory it know that just won a hundred big 
or whatever it is mk no momentum mk exactly exactly just chips and we we love imbuing all sorts 
things with personality and with meaning and with intention so just noise just stuff that does not care about 
it has no emotions it has no memory it care whether winning or losing the deck care gonna be 
deck sc but nevertheless i agree with all of these things and yet i like you and everyone else 
the world who has played poker has these experiences where immediately after you do something or at least ten 
after you know like that was a really irrational thing to and you can know what the rational thing 
do is and yet you do it and i guess my two questions very tiny sure you can answer 
quickly number one why does that happen do we do things that part of our brains certainly know this 
irrational and number two are there practical strategies that you learned from poker or from this journey you were 
for doing that a little bit less mk yeah a big difference between theory and execution and there are 
lot of steps in between so i find myself many many times i can see myself from the outside 
know what the correct move is and i make it because usually an emotional reason scared i think going 
work i want to lose a lot of chips i want to take on the risk feeling risk averse 
feeling very risk seeking and even though i know i should fold and i know the correct decision here 
that i have the best cards just mad at this person just rubbing me the wrong way and i 
do it anyway and so i do it and right away i say my god i know i should 
right so it happens in both directions and usually an emotional reason mk and sometimes also an execution problem 
you you theoretically know but you trust yourself enough and so in and i think this is true everywhere 
life if not feeling it not going to work because people can see that they can sense weakness they 
sense hesitation they can sense when bluffing in a sense even if not bluffing so in a negotiation if 
say i want a but they can see that really scared and scared of saying that and that not 
walk away and not going to get that raise sc yeah mk and something where a disconnect between what 
know you should do what you actually do and then if you do it and that disconnect is still 
still not going to work so you need to have everything be in sync and difficult so i think 
way that one does that is first through practice so you have to just do it over and over 
over people who study too much theory of anything whether in poker or in some other arena and actually 
actually do these things actually put themselves out there and play hands whether actual hands or metaphorical hands without 
practice not going to be able to get comfortable not going to be able to execute under pressure mk 
trying to do is get it into that part of your brain where it becomes almost instinct where it 
something easy for you to do like when learning any new skill think about something well this is a 
example for me because i know how to drive but think about what i imagine learning how to drive 
for most people that at the beginning you have to try to coordinate everything everything is kind of a 
scary you really have to pay attention to everything and then at some point it all goes on autopilot 
to speak and things become much easier and then you can also start executing things that you do before 
threepoint turns which i not quite sure what they are but i know scary sc but this makes this 
sense in sort of distinction between system one and system right where i think system one is all the 
subconscious things going on and system two is your conscious cognition that takes a lot of brain power to 
on and so what saying is what we can try to teach ourselves to do is to move as 
processes from system two into system right make them subconscious and then that leaves system two with its very 
finite amount of brain power to think about the important cases that are not automatically solved by our newly 
instincts mk exactly exactly a lot of it comes down to that and a lot of it comes down 
realizing when we need to put system two online when i was just starting to play poker it was 
hard for me to execute any sort of meaningful bluffs because i was just so worried about paying attention 
everything and also because i had a very good teacher who would tell me need you to pay attention 
the stack size as i need you to pay attention to how many times this person has raised in 
last ten hands or one hundred hands or just all of these things and thinking you know i even 
the poker room in the casino how am i ever going to think about all of these things at 
and slowly slowly slowly you that becomes second nature because getting used to doing it and then all of 
sudden you can think you start being able to think are these the right cards to bluff with in 
situation is this the right time to raise is this the right time to make the that still mean 
to be able to do it because you still might be scared because you might do it once and 
work you get caught and then you feel sheepish and you wanna try it again or you get caught 
works and then you become a little bit too optimistic and start making mistakes in the other direction mk 
so you have to keep doing it over and over and you have to get to a point where 
and to me one of the things that actually really helped me and this is very funny because a 
the last math class i took was in high school not my background at all i was very nervous 
poker that i would need advanced mathematics eric told me you be fine as long as you can add 
multiply divide be so i always thought my edge was going to be psychological which it is however the 
that actually helped me learn to be more confident in executing bluffs and executing moves and figuring all of 
out and actually putting into practice what i knew i should do in theory was working with solvers and 
with this highly mathematical thing mk i need to understand how to run monte carlo simulations the computer can 
it for me but if i do it and if i understand the inputs and understand what working with 
then look at the output and then try to reason through why why does the computer say that i 
bluff with this particular hand with this particular card and you suddenly start to see the logic behind it 
the thinking behind it and then when playing it feel like a bluff it feels like i know that 
should do this here with this card this percent of the not bluffing actually just executing the strategy that 
should based on what holding based on what seeing based on what doing mk of course nowhere in the 
especially for me especially for someone who mathematically inclined but that was very surprising to me that a mathematical 
actually helped me psychologically be able to be more confident about some of these situations where in the past 
where i quite pull a trigger sc it does make me wonder because wondering about again why we do 
these failure modes or these mistakes kahneman talks i think a little bit about how some of our heuristics 
our instincts have evolved for certain reasons but it almost sounds like what we should be aiming for at 
poker table is to remove emotions from our decisionmaking process entirely to become spock or data as much as 
and maybe that is a difference between playing poker and living our lives mk absolutely absolutely but i actually 
that what we should aspire to do is first of all i think we should realize that we remove 
entirely because emotional creatures human and not always good not always the right thing to do to remove emotion 
a situation there was a lot of work that was done by antonio damasio a neuroscientist on something called 
iowa gambling task i get into that task because that task has a lot of problems with it but 
was since replicated in other gambling environments and he looked at people who actually had cortical damage whose brains 
not process risk so they had no risk aversion whatsoever and they ended up not doing well they went 
mk so people who just experience the fear of risk at all went broke and did not make good 
and so sometimes emotions are actually important sometimes emotions keep us from going broke there for a reason because 
to the decision so i think what we need to learn is to actually be more mindful and more 
and pay more attention to ourselves as we play so that we can one identify when feeling an emotion 
figure out what the emotion is and where coming from so that we can of the time we want 
discard it and say emotion i see here gonna put you aside i know feeling you but not important 
my decision let me just put you here and make my decision without and then that say actually telling 
something important maybe i should listen to you maybe it is time for me to step away from the 
because just not capable of thinking clearly right now because too angry i control it i actually put it 
whatever it is so i think a lot of it is about learning to see those patterns those thought 
those reaction patterns in yourself so that you can then just account for them and acknowledge them and then 
them aside and make a decision without them sc yeah and the idea of bluffing is probably one of 
regimes in poker where emotions come in pretty strongly and i remember being very impressed by when they first 
it i think it was von neumann who proved that whatever the best strategy is in a game like 
going to be a mixed strategy where you do the same thing every time in exactly the same situation 
that is exactly the kind of things human beings are just not very good at judging and so you 
to be in a situation where you know what the onaverage best play is and yet not do it 
and i know yeah probably some mixture of bringing emotions into the game you wanna be a little bit 
a daredevil but also suppressing the wrong emotions in these kinds of times mk absolutely absolutely and we are 
bad at mixed strategies and oftentimes we think randomizing a very popular term in poker these days that randomizing 
strategy you know of the time i do this and i do and we normally very hard for humans 
do that and so what a lot of actually the best players do is they have some sort of 
so that for instance i know a lot of players look at a watch and they look at where 
second hand is and they because they can look to see if between twelve and one or one and 
et cetera then they have their randomizer and if it happens at ten times in a row doing the 
that they really wanna be doing well so be it because they just look at that and what do 
true randomization or as true as you can get at a poker table but still incredibly difficult and yeah 
really does play into it why we randomize correctly why we mix well because we often just say i 
that supposed to do this whatever percent of the time i feel like doing this right now so just 
do sc yeah but i actually have a theory about this i know about that trick of looking into 
watch with the second hand to randomize but we also know that human beings are bad at feeling what 
random sequences are like and part of me thinks that what we should be aiming to do is not 
be random but to appear random chuckle we should try to give the opponents at the table the appearance 
we do something of the time whether or not actually that way so i think that it would actually 
better just to judge done this the last three times and i know that i should do it only 
out of four times so next time with a probability gonna do the other mk i think really smart 
i was researching the biggest bluff i met this man a really fascinating thinker his name is frank lantz 
he runs the gaming center at nyu and sc i sorry maria i should say that both antonio damasio 
frank lantz are previous mindscape guests so the audiences know about them yes mk oh fascinating great okay excellent 
i had a chance to talk to frank lantz and he has done a lot with game design and 
he told me is that actually a lot of people when designing games they design the probabilities incorrectly on 
because they know that the human mind experience real probabilities in a good way so they know that players 
get frustrated if really random and just on a losing streak and so they actually skew it they skew 
randomizers so not truly random and one of the reasons he loves poker is because you do that in 
and poker is a naturally random game and so he thinks that it forces us to acknowledge that and 
it forces the human mind to actually take that into account and to just to hit over the head 
it and deal with it and he actually thinks that a perfectly designed game but one that modern game 
would never design sc interesting yeah mk people players would actually just rebel and say is and if you 
about it think of how many times people play poker online and say is rigged this is a rigged 
oh yeah chuckle mk could i keep losing over and because they understand that true probabilities can look like 
and that sometimes yeah you get quads four times in an hour on a table sc yeah yeah and 
flip side of that is that we can say how poker is a merciless teacher and makes you try 
be as rational as possible yet we both know real poker players and some of them are pretty darn 
and convinced that all the luck in the world goes against them right we can name names chuckle mk 
absolutely we will not name names i talk about luck i got so damn lucky that erik seidel was 
person i wanted to coach me and that he said yes because he is just one of the calmest 
most evenkeeled people ever meet he does not tilt and the fact that he would just nip all of 
bad thought habits in the bud for me that was so powerful because i wanted to do the same 
i would start telling him bad beat stories and for nonpoker players bad beat stories are basically when you 
have won but you someone sucked out on you or set over set someone had higher cards than you 
just the world went against you and you wanna start ranting and raving mk and the first time i 
to do that he yelled at me very hard to imagine if ever met erik seidel raising his voice 
he it was as close to a yell as ever heard and he explained to me that this was 
a really really horrible way of thinking that i should not dwell on that because that happens just variance 
control the and so a bad mental habit and going to make me a worse player and i think 
right because if you keep dwelling on the bad beats gonna affect your decision gonna affect your emotions gonna 
you a less pleasant person to be around but it also just actually affects how you process hands and 
you process information and so grateful to him even though in the moment i was pretty upset and i 
to just let have him listen to me so grateful to him because these days i remember how i 
tournaments most of the time unless it was a very interesting hand i even remember those hands because all 
remember is did i make an interesting decision when were there interesting thought problems what went wrong or what 
right how could my decision not what the outcome was mk and eric would always say can listen to 
hand i want you to tell me the hand if you have a question about it if something and 
so when we discuss hands together he care how it ended after my river decision is done he care 
i won or lost in fact he even wanna know that information is totally irrelevant all he cares about 
the decision modes leading up to it and i think so powerful and that very very freeing because if 
just think that way about everything not just poker it really helps you i think let go of things 
just be a much more evenkeeled person now i understand why erik is just a zen master sc well 
think zen master is exactly the term i was gonna bring up almost monkly or saintly this idea that 
process and what we do is what we should be focusing our judgment on not the outcome in the 
world the idea of being resultsoriented sounds like a compliment but poker players use it as an insult you 
about what the result was not whether or not you made the right decision mk absolutely absolutely and being 
is one of the worst mistakes you can make as a poker player because going to stop you from 
because going to take the wrong information and going to draw the wrong conclusions if a really bad decision 
out a few times like i should always do this because they always fold and no you just got 
lucky you got lucky twice and all that happened you made really really bad decisions sc right mk and 
so important not to be resultsoriented and that it also i think one of the reasons that erik has 
the longevity that had is because been very savvy about managing his money even when winning because he knows 
variance looks like he knows that no matter how much he wins now that mean going to keep winning 
the same rate so many players who could have been great players just went broke because they go on 
hot streak the variance is in their favor they make a lot of money and then whoops they stop 
but by that point already spent it all and there they go there goes their career so i think 
important not just not to be resultsoriented not just when playing poker but to then take that thinking in 
broader way sc well and a lesson where maybe slightly less confidently but we can apply it to broader 
of outcomes and results in life there are people who do take wild risks many of them fail we 
hear of them some of them do really really well and in their minds and the minds of the 
of the world geniuses and could do no wrong but if a million people flip a bunch of coins 
of them are gonna get ten heads in a row mk absolutely absolutely and then the ones who are 
write books and use hand play bias to explain exactly why they were successful and then other people try 
do it because choosing on the dependent variable which you know you cannot do sc yeah not supposed to 
mk you need to exactly you know you need to have all those other cases well what about all 
companies that did everything doing and failed or all the people who did everything doing and and so hard 
us to think that way we look at the success stories and we want an explanation we want certainty 
want a story we want a narrative we want to know what brought you from point a to point 
and so easy once the success is there to supply the reasons sc and this is very unlike academia 
journalism where the best people inevitably rise to the top for reasons of value and virtue chuckle mk absolutely 
chuckle sc just so that everyone knows yeah just so and podcasting also yes mk oh absolutely best podcaster 
speaking of which yeah chuckle you were a trained psychologist and this was i guess your pitch to erik 
one of the best poker players bringing a slightly different angle to this did it help did being a 
psychologist when you sit down at the table once you know the basic mathematical formulas and probabilities were you 
to psychologize your fellow players a little bit and was that a useful skill mk absolutely i actually do 
that being an outsider more broadly but a psychologist and a journalist really helped me so the psychology part 
me identify a lot of the things and a lot of the dynamics that i was seeing and so 
had a framework within which to work so that i i could not just see the bias i could 
the bias i knew what was happening and it helped me address it better because i had this metacognitive 
that i think a lot of people who are playing at the poker table have simply because not their 
not their framework not the way they think through things but i think that that really helped and also 
how people can tilt in a lot of different ways helped me identify positive tilt helped me identify all 
these dynamics mk so walter mischel my advisor he had this theory that basically we all only exist within 
contexts and different people in different contexts and what you need to know in order to figure out what 
of a person is is to have something that he called a behavioral signature for them given that this 
what happens then so say something like no such thing as a person riskseeking a person riskseeking in certain 
but maybe in other environments that person is very riskaverse no such thing as a person just sociable of 
time you might be very extroverted very outgoing love people but believe me i will find that person with 
you are not only not sociable but you become the least sociable person in the world i will find 
and so having that sort of background and having that sort of approach to people really helped me i 
identify dynamics at the table that other people might have missed mk and i actually use it a lot 
the sense that i talk to people i talk a lot at the poker table not when playing when 
a hand i talk at all but when sitting i get to know people i try to figure out 
you coming from why are you playing motivating i try to get at some of their inner psychology because 
helps me understand them and that helps me understand why they might make certain decisions why they might make 
plays gotten much better at it over time in the beginning i was bad just flat out bad because 
quite sure what i was looking for and i know poker and so i lacked part of that context 
i think over time i got much better and then the journalist part of me i think was incredibly 
because used to listening used to being in the background and just letting people tell me their stories and 
the poker table so valuable not to have your own ego at the table and to just look at 
else and let them tell you what their stories are i think one of the things that actually is 
biggest edge is that i try to keep my ego out of it sc well one of the great 
about your book i think is that you seem to delight you take a special pleasure in talking about 
failures when something went terribly wrong chuckle but educational to the rest of us and one of them was 
early on in your career you would make what maybe this is a term of art in psychology but 
called it thinsliced judgements where basically judging someone on their appearances and leaping to a conclusion too quickly and 
contrary signals so another thing that poker i guess teaches us to be better at mk oh absolutely and 
this is a term of art in psychology where you use a thin slice of someone to then just 
a judgement about everything and there are so many stories i could tell you about poker but usually they 
guys in tank tops and with big biceps and tattoos and usually facial hair too how a lot of 
stories start because i just sc but or little old ladies right there are things that mk or little 
ladies yes that too that too or little old ladies and those are the two strongest but boy was 
wrong in so many instances where i just saw a guy like that like a bully gonna be a 
poker bro and gonna be trying and a lot of times not just normal players or sometimes even very 
and they aggressive at all and if aggressive you have to be really careful and the little old ladies 
though you think that your best friend and that harmless and that so nice and sweet and wonderful if 
poker players and a lot of them are they will then throw that right back at you and no 
solidarity there chuckle sc nope be telling you that a sweet young darling while counting your chips in their 
right mk exactly exactly a saying in poker are no friends at the poker and so easy to forget 
forgotten it so many times i still sometimes forget it because i wanna be mean or i sc yeah 
wanna be friends but nothing personal mk yeah or possibly be bluffing me we were having such a nice 
i know i know well jennifer and i both like playing poker but we play at the same table 
the casino together just asking for trouble mk absolutely absolutely i think that a very wise policy i hope 
at the table in the tournament together there have been some interesting situations i know if you know the 
brothers sam and luc they are identical twins and and both high stakes tournament players both really nice guys 
ethical never been any hint of anything untoward between the two of them but awkward right sitting right next 
your identical twin like gonna have to bluff because going on and they do they do not soft play 
other sometimes just vicious when you watch them on a tv table and like ooooh sc you could see 
happening yeah well one of the themes in your book relevant to this is you have a search for 
right metaphor to bring to your adventure as a poker player like you started i forget but there was 
you were an army general and then you were a jazz musician and a detective and then eventually a 
right i mean you realise and this was in your wheelhouse like when you look at these people who 
with telling an inner story about who they are and more specifically telling a story about that particular hand 
the actions they took in it was very helpful in deciding how to respond mk absolutely so right i 
on so many hats as i went on this journey and it was so funny to realise that at 
end of the day storytelling which is what always done is the thing that can serve me the best 
mean sometimes you have you realise that the tools you already have are the ones that really do work 
well and this was actually an insight that i got from phil galfond who is also just this wonderful 
player great guy who spent a lot of time working with me as well mk and at some point 
told me to try to use what i already know to try to use my storytelling skills and when 
said that that actually made something click because i realised everyone does tell stories at the poker table every 
action is part of a narrative and that helps you when thinking about how other people play it helps 
analyse it because not trying to think the probability of him blah blah blah is because as already talked 
most people rational playing in such a very strict game theoretical way human and trying to tell you a 
so you look for inconsistencies you look for what said you look does everything add up or not and 
also helps you play better because you start thinking does my story make sense and the story i want 
tell and how do i tell it from the it helps you lay out your plan of attack it 
you lay out your strategy before you make the first move because you have to think through the whole 
you have to think through the whole narrative mk and like with any story you have to be willing 
change so sometimes writing and you realize that your outline was wrong that what you thought was going to 
in this piece or in this book happening and then you have to reevaluate and i think that that 
of flexibility is also very important in poker because you could have the story the outline the idea for 
going to happen and then the information just changes drastically and you need to be willing to then scrap 
and say well what was the story i was telling how does this new information fit into and i 
it or and sometimes the answer is no and when you know i need to give sc mk this 
not a story gonna end well sc i remember when i started playing poker one of the dumbest things 
i would do was i twenty minutes or half an hour had gone by and i had not bluffed 
all so i would decide before the hand started that i was gonna bluff this hand and just not 
because if you learn a little bit you realize there are good places to do that kind of thing 
bad places and you have to be able to adapt to that story in real time another thing that 
beings are just bad at right we tend to make a plan and bullheadedly go forward with the plan 
absolutely absolutely we tend to not always be the most flexible creatures sc no mk and we often like 
to new things and new developments and new circumstances once again i think that aversion to uncertainty we have 
game plan and we wanna follow the game plan try to tell me the game plan has changed i 
for this game plan sc yep mk and a skill i think something that we can all learn we 
all be better at something that i am still working on everyday i think all of these elements that 
learn in poker are things that you just have to keep working on and i think the moment that 
say mastered is actually the moment you should be really scared because none of these are things that i 
ever can be mastered fully sc well we should give our listeners who are either current or potential poker 
some tangible advice that they can use to improve their games i was thinking you can give whatever advice 
think is most interesting but i was gonna ask about tells about the idea that something someone says or 
or gestures or facial expressions at the poker table can give away whether strong or weak or bluffing or 
the truth do you is that a real thing is that something that the experts rely a lot on 
i think tells are a real thing and i think that under used that said i think that at 
highest levels there are far fewer tells than at the lower levels because the better a player is the 
tells there are sc makes sense mk and a lot of times tells look like what you think going 
look like so a lot of times people are looking at things like did he fidget did he do 
did he do that oh he looked and heard that looking up is a sign of lying and things 
that just gestures and very specific things most of the times those are too noisy because in order for 
tell to tell you anything it needs to be something reliable and for that you need a lot of 
and frankly just have enough time at a poker table to get enough instances to know whether something is 
a tell or a noise but the way that tells i think work much better is if you start 
at deviations from behaviour so just pay attention my number one piece of advice is pay attention to all 
the players mk really hard if sitting at a full table so start with the two players to your 
because those are the players that be playing with most often because you are the button when the blinds 
so just automatically be in pots with them more often than with other players at the table and just 
them and look how are they sitting how are they acting normally when not playing how are they acting 
a hand and try to get all of the data that you can so whenever a hand goes to 
down whenever you actually see what they had think back through how they acted and how they played that 
were they bluffing or not because you have some concrete evidence and then you can actually start drawing some 
of vague connection mk and then what you wanna be looking for is any deviations from how they normally 
so if normally sitting in one way and then suddenly their posture has shifted it might shift differently for 
single person and so that a shift in posture in and of itself if suddenly sitting more still or 
more that mean bluffing or not bluffing what about this specific person have they acted this way before and 
not try to figure out what does it mean based on the information you have and even then be 
and try to use sc but the hard thing if someone does something very much out of character it 
be either really weak or really strong just that not in the middle mk exactly exactly why i said 
to look at show downs try to see if that happens when they show a hand down and you 
were they strong or were they weak but like i said even then be careful because that should not 
the thing on which you base your decision sc yeah mk it should be kind of the drop in 
bucket if you need more information so i try not to have a tell be the thing that i 
on the most under rare circumstances people have tells that are real so i i once played with a 
who when he was weak you could just tell his whole posture just shifted and it was so funny 
i was so sad when we were moved to different sc of course mk because i loved playing with 
but rare sc for like the tiebreaker i mean you still gotta figure out what your percentages are and 
handle this mk exactly exactly a tiebreaker is a wonderful way of looking at it but i do think 
to pay attention to how people are acting because sometimes also pick up on cues that you even realize 
up on sc okay and also the expectation to pay attention is very crucial because over and above the 
right building up a model of this person how they act in different circumstances and it might it might 
completely based on their actions not on their facial expressions their actions in the sense of what their bets 
raises are and stuff like that but people are different and kind of crucial mk absolutely absolutely and then 
of the other things that i write about in the book that i go into detail now but that 
think is fascinating is that paying attention to hands can actually be one of the physical things that is 
most telling so people tend to move differently tend to move their hands differently when different degrees of strong 
think really interesting sc so if one of your goals anyway at the beginning of the project was not 
to win hundreds of thousands of dollars in poker tournaments but to learn to be a better thinker and 
and so forth did it work is the rest of your life affected by the training you have in 
and can other people you think improve their mental game by practicing at the poker tables mk absolutely absolutely 
thinking has become so much stronger just around everything and i feel a difference in how i approach situations 
i break them down and my ability to really try to gauge the quality of a decision without looking 
the outcome without thinking about the outcome not something that i was good at before and i mean sometimes 
really difficult to think that way but at least i try become much better at identifying my emotions i 
become a much stronger person because had to confront a lot of the kind of internal issues had that 
make me much more passive at a poker table that would make me fold that would make me kind 
play in a suboptimal way because had to confront it in poker i think that has made me more 
to confront it in my personal life so had some negotiations where i was able to get more money 
i otherwise would for instance like a very practical thing came out of it sc yeah mk that was 
because i was thinking in these kind of poker terms and i think especially right now with everything going 
in the world the fact that i think poker has really made me realize and try to internalize a 
of the tenets of stoicism that studied as an undergrad but never really understood what it meant i think 
really served me well the idea of controlling what you can and focusing on those things that you can 
and then letting go of the things that you realizing the world is going to happen bad things are 
to happen good things are going to happen just things are going to happen i control them so let 
focus on the things that are actually within my power let me work on honing my skills in the 
where actually going to be helpful the quality of my decision process the quality of my emotional reactions of 
way that i think and respond and the outside world well i control that so let me not expend 
emotional energy let me not expend my mental space trying to worry about it too much sc yeah no 
think a super valuable lesson but it brings me back to something that i said before but raise it 
because there are some poker players that seem to live up to that ideal of sort of zenlike detachment 
then you found in erik seidel a mentor maybe dan harrington who you also talked to for the book 
like that but a lot of very successful poker players who just seem like crazy thrill seekers in some 
right and even if they win a million dollars they lose it playing baccarat the next day so clearly 
weird balance give and take or maybe just some ability to turn on and turn off that irrational thrill 
you need to be able to say know what i have a really bad hand but i think i 
force this push person to fold so just gonna make a crazy and i know whether a zenlike detachment 
the right attitude to bring to that laughter mk no i think a very valid point and i think 
if the kind of player who knows exactly why running a crazy bluff and doing it with a very 
approach i mean even an erik seidel or a dan harrington is perfectly capable of executing an insane bluff 
the right moment against the right person they just do it because they feel like this is the moment 
bluff they do it for irrational reasons and i do think that a lot of players who are really 
poker players and then not so great at life capable of doing that at the poker table but then 
they turn it off sc yeah okay mk they apply it to any other context i talked earlier about 
of this metacognitive awareness well they have it for them they can do it at the poker table and 
they just let it all go somewhere else someone else who i met during the process of writing this 
who unfortunately died as i was writing it was one of mentors paul magriel known as and x is 
perfect example of someone who was brilliant at games horrible in life knew it and it was still the 
he quite get over it sc because human beings are complicated messes of different little subprocesses right not a 
singular curl cheetos or whatever we have different parts to ourselves that we bring to different situations mk exactly 
complex where shades of gray not black and white a lot of uncertainty a lot of unknown and just 
lot of complexity there and i think that a wonderful thing sc yeah yeah absolutely absolutely we should celebrate 
but so to finish up not even sure if this is a question or just a statement that maybe 
can expand upon but aside from poker and aside from rationality and emotions and bringing them into line and 
like that your book is also a story about just taking a wild leap into learning something not as 
young kid that is a completely different world right a testament to the excitement and the potential downfall sometimes 
just throwing yourself wholeheartedly into something pretty alien what are your feelings about that having done it you tell 
great stories about going on helicopters in monte carlo and casinos in macau and so forth mk yeah i 
absolutely true it was a huge leap and it just scared the crap out of me in every single 
both because i took an established career and said gonna put you on hold and gonna just go into 
crazy and so many people i respected told me i was insane they said know you stop writing regularly 
the new yorker gonna forget your name gonna forget who you are you need to be in front of 
you need to you need to build the momentum of your career you need to build your reputation you 
other people would say if gonna pull a george plimpton and go all experiential journalism why poker gambling horrible 
awful thing why go into that and so i had a lot of these thoughts in the back of 
mind that this might be a terrible mistake and i was really scared and then i was really scared 
to write this book because not a first person journalist normally i only write about other people i use 
i remember the last time i used i in a piece i wrote and this book was going to 
completely different mk and so that was also a huge leap of faith for me i know if be 
to pull it off i know i know if people would like it i know if people would like 
voice i know what my voice was in that context so all of it was really scary and in 
weird way how i knew it was something i really wanted to do because the way that actually approached 
lot of my life is that new things should be scary and if not scared that means that not 
yourself enough that means that just not going to grow because staying too much in your comfort zone and 
a few crazy career things in my life i moved to new york with just no money whatsoever i 
a bartender i took a job for twentythree thousand dollars a year in new york so that i could 
and a lot of these things quite work out i think i went through five jobs in my first 
out of college but i mk and it was always scary but i always thought know what let me 
and very very lucky in the sense that even though i come from a wealthy family at all i 
up just in a poor family and now nicely middle class but we came from the soviet union we 
nothing we were just political refugees and so i it like my parents would say worry pay your they 
would love to but they but they are the most supportive loving people and always had my back and 
i knew that if shit hit the fan i could always just go home right i could always i 
parents who were there and they said pay your rent but you can come move back in with us 
give you this but we love you and we support you and the reason we moved to this country 
so that you could do whatever you wanted not so that be a doctor or a my sister is 
a doctor so it made made it easier to do that so that you could do what you want 
and i think i wanna underestimate and understate how important that was knowing that i had that emotional backing 
think it made me much more able to take risks that not everyone has the luxury of taking sc 
a once again a mixed strategy right i mean a little bit of a balance between being responsible understanding 
there is a backup plan and so forth but not just being complacent not just doing the same thing 
and over again i think too easy to be either a crazy gambler or a stodgy stick in the 
and keeping things interesting without inviting disaster is a tricky balance and worth trying worth aiming for mk absolutely 
i think if i can keep meeting that goal throughout my life i think it will be a life 
in a lot of ways sc me too and i think the book is a great success and people 
read it will get that feeling and the excitement will come across so maria konnikova thanks so much for 
on the mindscape podcast mk thank you so much for having me sean music this was a wonderful episode 
have some remarks about the concept of further down i will refer to the star trek character data to 
my point etymologically the word just as the word goes back to the latin word to move emotion in 
widest possible sense signifies that which makes us move we must recognize a spectrum roughly ordering emotions by how 
lasting power they have necessary interstition the human psyche is very sensitive to change but the human psyche can 
amazingly blind for things that remain constant for everything that follows this should be kept in mind if we 
be asked to mention a bunch of emotions the ones that come to mind first are the most volatile 
those emotions are the most visible to us because they change rapidly example anger for most people anger is 
emotion that flares up fast and then ebbs away again i argue that we should equally recognize persistent emotions 
loyalty loyalty is an emotion but by nature there is nothing volatile about it the very nature of loyalty 
that it is very very constant a person who is very loyal and very dedicated is strongly moved in 
sense but in our process of thinking about that we tend to be blind to those powerful emotions because 
general the human psyche tends to overlook things that remain constant about the character data in star trek next 
let me describe how the writers of that show went about creating the character data not the conscious thought 
but the unconscious thought process all characters in that show are loyal dedicated people they are loyal to earth 
are loyal to star fleet they are loyal to their fellow crew members for the character data the writers 
a character who does not have any volatile emotion that is of the spectrum from volatile emotions to persistent 
the writers left out the volatile emotions but the volatile emotions are only a small part of the total 
of emotions data has all kinds of things that he is dedicated to to the viewer data is a 
character because the difference between him and the other humans is minute in everyday language when we refer to 
person as rational what we mean is that that person emphasizes looking at the big picture a person for 
the big picture the long term goal takes precedence well the word is used in multiple mutually inconsistent ways 
ways the word is used are so fuzzy that for understanding how it is intended it is completely dependent 
context thought experiment what if the character data would have been designed to not have any emotion neither volatile 
nor any persistent emotion well that would have created a totally nonrelatable character without any emotion data would not 
capable of any form of dedication he would not join star fleet no reason to an entity without any 
would not move at all our emotions are what make us move without any emotion you just are you
