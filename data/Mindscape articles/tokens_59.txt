and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today gonna be talking about robots talked about 
before on mindscape a natural topic to imagine but usually talking about what kinds of robots there are what 
might be doing today going to be focusing on the human side what do human beings do what should 
do when they interact with robots how should we think about robots when dealing with them most of us 
no trouble telling the difference between a robot and a living feeling organism nevertheless our brains often treat robots

darling is a researcher at media lab not an engineer who builds robots she actually comes from a socialscience 
interested in what we should do with the fact that we tend to treat robots as if they are 
beings we anthroporphize them we assign attribute feelings to them and emotions and ideas to robots even when we 
they have them you need to be looking like a human being as a robot to get another human 
to treat you like a person we treat our roombas like people our laptops like people so up with 
what does it mean for the future this is an area where as very often when technology is advancing 
legal system and the philosophy and how we think about these things lags behind so anything we can do 
get into our brains going on ahead of time will be very useful sc one other thing a big 
that i have and wanted to share with you which is that it looks like mindscape will be getting 
getting advertisements at some point not absolutely sure and i exactly know when going to happen but it seems 
be the direction in which moving i know when going to happen but let you know ahead of time 
did go back and forth on this i will be honest because obviously ads are good because they get 
and i like money i will never you know try to pretend otherwise on the other hand you have 
admit they kind of get in the way of the actual substance of the podcast i try to pretend 
either what pushed me over the edge into agreeing with the ad thing was the idea that it could 
a lot more listeners not that just getting ads that be joining a network that will publicize the podcast 
bring it to new audiences and that i really think is important maybe flattering myself but i enjoy what 
here i think interesting important i want to share it with as many people as we can a big 
of that is just getting the word out and being part of a network would be a huge benefit 
that it change the substance it change who i get how long the podcast is what we talk about 
of those things it will just be a new platform on which the podcast will appear so keep you 
on that sc so who knows robots maybe the robots will be reading the ads maybe someday all podcasts 
just be invented by robots and then consumed by robots maybe the human beings will just rake in the 
at the end of the day i know what here to find out so go music sc kate darling 
to the mindscape podcast kate darling thanks for having me sean sc so at the mit media lab and 
work on robots so i think that for many of the people in the audience they will instantly assume 
you spend your time building robots or programming robots or something like that but not what you do in 
you come from a legal background so tell us a little bit about how you got here and sort 
what your job is there in the robotic space kd yeah i sadly build robots very bad at that 
i have tried i made a little solar powered robot sc wow more than me kd it it charges 
and then it moves a little bit and that was my great accomplishment in robotics chuckle kd but yes 
i have a legal and social sciences background and the way i got here the short version is i 
robots and found a way to do something with robots but the longer version is probably that i have 
been interested in how systems shape human behavior and so what originally drew me to law and later to 
and then to technology because all three of those are systems that shape human behavior sc sure but you 
a wonderful story that sure told hundreds of times about the first time that you started thinking about how 
beings react to robots kd yes yes i was still a law student at that point and i had 
a pleo which is this baby dinosaur robot that came out in this japanese toy i bought it because 
i mentioned always loved robots this was a really cool one it had all these motors and touch sensors 
responded to your touch it was supposed to develop its own personality depending on how you treated it it 
this inferred camera in the snout and then one of the things that had was a tilt sensor so 
knew what direction it was facing it knew it was upside down and it would respond to that by 
distress and crying chuckle kd and it was it was a pretty realistic depiction of being in pain and 
thought that was super cool and i would show it off to my friends and be like it up 
the tail see what it and one of my friends held it up for a very long time and 
started to bother me so i asked him to put the robot back down and then i started to 
it to make it stop crying and that just kind of blew my mind because i a very maternal 
but also i knew exactly how the robot worked and i was compelled to be kind to it anyway 
so that really sparked my curiosity about human robot interaction and our psychology around interacting with robots and i 
discovered that not just me sc yeah and interesting because teaching us at the surface level at least that 
teach us anything about robots it teaches us something about human beings right and how we interface with the 
kd absolutely i think the most fascinating thing to me about robotics is what robots can teach us about 
psychology human behavior and interacting with each other sc so what do we i mean can we at this 
identify the features that your little dinosaur had that made you connect with it a whole gamut of different 
of robots from roombas to selfdriving cars maybe even we should count the little tamagotchis the little pets that 
know they sold to kids and we at different levels we anthropomorphise these for some reason or another kd 
yeah and not just robots either we have this inherent tendency to anthropomorphise anything you know one of the 
thing a baby learns to recognize is a face whether a real face or just an image and we 
this deeply ingrained tendency to project ourselves and our own humanlike qualities onto other entities whether our pets that 
see the dog looks guilty whether the sc oh yeah kd actually looks guilty we really know or i 
read the example that people will see a monkey yawning in the zoo and will be like oh the 
when really just showing off the teeth that can rip your face off sc right kd so we will 
just make all these assumptions about others kids develop relationships to stuffed animals we we respond to a lot 
different things one of the things that we respond pretty strongly to is movement been conditioned through evolution to 
able to recognize whether something is an agent and moving or whether something is an object because we needed 
detect natural predators at least the reason that the evolutionary psychologists give us but definitely true that studies show 
very quick to detect animal movement and autonomous seeming movement much more quickly than other types of movement and 
thing about robots is that they move in exactly that type of autonomous way so robots are physical they 
in the physical world which we kind of respond to as physical creatures they move in this autonomous way 
then there are different design elements that you can layer on top of that to make people really really 
to robots as though they were a living thing so the baby dinosaur with a cute big eyes sc 
kd one example but you know people will even have a response to the roomba like you mentioned do 
have a roomba sc i do not have a roomba no do you have one are you attached to 
chuckle kd i used to have one we did name it which a lot of people do and i 
just talking to the people from irobot that made the first the roomba the first real successful robot vacuum 
and they you know they say most people name their roombas send them in to get repaired and want 
same one back be like meryl sweep is broken we want a new one we want you to fix 
so people and people feel bad for their roomba when it gets stuck somewhere so even just a very 
robot that just moves around your floor will cause people to have this emotional response sc so probably multifaceted 
because i think i know anything about tamagotchis but i do remember thinking that hearing about the fad when 
came out and people would care for their little virtual pets and they were not embodied right they were 
on a screen have studies been done about the different roles of being anthropomorphic having a face moving all 
different aspects and how they play into how we project organic nature onto these robots kd well yeah there 
entire fields that research this so the precursor to human robot interaction is probably humancomputer interaction which looked at 
ways that people or among other things the ways that people treat computers like social entities and sc we 
blame them when things go wrong put it that way kd chuckle well we blame them yeah but people 
also polite to them this really great study that cliff nass and some other people did back in the 
where they showed that if you do a task on a computer and then asked to rate the performance 
asked to rate it using a different computer be more honest and more negative about how the computer performed 
if asked to do it on the same computer because you have this instinct that you wanna hurt the 
sc wow kd so people we are such suckers for anthropomorphizing anything you know you mentioned the tamagotchi also 
video game portal that was really in like fifteen years ago i remember in the game you have this 
cube that comes with you just this cube just with you in every level and then at the very 
of the game i think safe to spoil it given how old the game is supposed to incinerate the 
cube to complete the last level and the game designers were surprised to see that a lot of people 
sacrifice themselves instead of burn up the cube just because we we do become attached even to virtual things 
physicality is an additional layer to that because there have been studies that show that people will treat something 
their physical space with even more empathy and even more like a social actor than something on a screen 
interesting and so i will prod you to give the other example that heard you give not quite a 
that you did but you asked a bunch of people to sort of bond with some robots and then 
asked them to do horrible things kd chuckle yes this is with my friend hannes gassert we took the 
dinosaur robot that i now have four of at home we took five of them we did this workshop 
a conference i think we had thirty people and we split them into five teams and gave them each 
robot and told them to name the robot and play with it and have them personify it a little 
built hats out of pipe cleaners and did a little fashion contest and then after fortyfive minutes of them 
with this robot we unveiled a hammer and a hatchet and we told them to torture and kill them 
kd and it was so dramatic that we actually had to start improvising because we had kind of expected 
would be a split in the room like some people will be like sure hit it just a and 
people would be like and we wanted to escalate the violence and see if that split of people changed 
was our original plan but with this particular group this was all adults between probably twentyfive and forty years 
age and they all absolutely refused to hit the robots so we had to be like what are we 
do okay you can save your robot if you hit this other groups robot with a and so they 
to do that and even that they they just do it so we were finally like everyone gonna destroy 
the robots unless someone takes a hatchet to one of and this guy stood up and took the hatchet 
the whole room stood around and we watched him bring the hatchet down on the robots neck and it 
very dramatic people winced they turned their faces away we could see this on the photos that we took 
our phones afterwards it was really interesting sc wow kd and then there was this halfserious half joking moment 
silence for the fallen robot so super dramatic workshop very interesting not science like you mentioned this was just 
workshop there was so much going on there but it did make me very curious what would happen to 
at some of the factors in a more scientific setting so it led to some research that i did 
on at the media lab with palash nandy and cynthia breazeal where we were looking at the correlation between 
and their willingness to hit a robot sc oh okay good well i definitely want to get to that 
first this was done at a conference did the people there were robot people i guess or what kind 
people were they were they just people off the street kd i know it one of it was called 
it was one of those innovation sc i get it okay kd that brought together designers and technologists and 
sorts of people sc okay and part of me wants to say that our immediate reaction when not in 
room killing the robots hearing about other people who are reluctant to do it and our immediate reaction is 
just a outside the milieu but in some sense a feature not a bug right part of who we 
that our brains attribute meaningfulness and moral agency even to objects that we know are completely inanimate kd i 
glad you feel that way i do as well laughter kd there are some people who say is a 
thing and we need to discourage we need to educate people that dealing with robots and to some extent 
think that there are some problems that can arise for example behavior might be able to be manipulated through 
and we might design technology in order to sell people products or even worse and so those are some 
that i think we need to be cautious about but generally i do not think it is a bad 
when a child is kind to a roomba i love that first instinct is to be kind to another 
and i think part of humanity and i think something that we should encourage and not discourage sc yeah 
i had a podcast interview with paul bloom recently and clearly been a very good podcast i keep referring 
referring to it in subsequent podcasts but he a yale psychologist and he wrote a book called against empathy 
his point is that empathy is usually very unevenly applied we have a lot much easier for us to 
empathetic with people like ourselves and that distorts our view of the world nicer to people like ourselves and 
more just and so forth and so instead of being empathetic he wants us to just be rational about 
it means to be moral or immoral i pushed back on that a little bit because i actually think 
empathy is very important to being a rational and moral person in the sense that it becomes too easy 
ignore people unlike ourselves when we try to have empathy with them sc sure easier to be empathetic with 
like ourselves but necessary and important to try harder to be empathetic with a wider range of people i 
not at the time thinking about robots at all though saying that some kind of relationship between how people 
with robots and how more widely empathetic is that true kd well certainly what our very preliminary research indicated 
did look at the correlation between tendencies for empathy and how willing they were to hit a robot and 
seemed to be a connection there that people who have very low empathic concern for others that they are 
more likely to hit a very lifelike robot and people who have high empathic concern for others are more 
to hesitate or even refuse i find paul interesting because i both agree and disagree with him kind of 
you i think that yes true that it can be problematic that we only relate to people who are 
us or things that are like us it can be problematic that we relate to robots because we see 
in them and not to certain other people that we see ourselves in dehumanized entire swathes of other people 
and of course we wanna do that in favor of things like robots that inherently deserve our empathy but 
does seem to be something to the emotional part of empathy in that it kind of lights a fire 
you and makes you care at all like you said i think that too easy if a completely rational 
to just not even care chuckle and so noticed myself since becoming a mother that become so much more 
generally not just towards other mothers because had this experience but for example in boston in the winter i 
walking around with a stroller and people sometimes shovel the sidewalks in front of their houses and i was 
if someone is in a chuckle i suddenly realize how awful it must be to be a disabled person 
boston and so i feel like this emotion that i have extends and makes me try and think of 
people as well in situations where i might not have cared before sc yeah the flipside of both of 
things in your example of having become a mother and the fact that we feel empathetic towards robots is 
it it reminds us of how involuntary a lot of who we are actually is right how much a 
of who we are is a bunch of impulses that comes up from beneath the surface not rational careful 
about right and wrong at a highly philosophically sophisticated level kd oh absolutely and i think that makes it 
uncomfortable somewhat an uncomfortable realization but i think very important to understand how our relationships work why we empathize 
another entity how communication works and that relationships can be very onesided learning so much about ourselves by looking 
how people interact with robots or even computers because starting to realize that all about ourselves and chuckle all 
us projecting ourselves onto others and we might learn more about our human humantohuman relationships in this as well 
right i mostly wanna talk about that side of things but you did bring up you tossed off the 
that we know that robots actually deserve our empathy so obviously gonna ask do we really know that as 
become more and more lifelike do we reach a point where we start saying they do deserve our empathy 
sean when i first got to mit i was like yeah gonna be in the place where developing the 
edge robotic technology so excited and then i got here and all the robots are broken or falling over 
nowhere close to developing a robot or an ai that can feel anything sc yeah kd i do think 
worth considering whether we need to treat robots a certain way because it might have an impact on our 
behavior but i i feel like the whole robots deserve inherently rights because they have consciousness a fun conversation 
have in a bar over beer but not i think gonna be there any time soon not practical sc 
and i agree and i think that most of what you are thinking about even trying to get there 
not trying to build the most humanconscious robot or even talking to people who do interested in how we 
with robots that are by complete agreement very mechanical in their insides right that no sense in which they 
feelings kd absolutely and they feel anything but we feel for them and the interesting thing sc and so 
are the applications here what good is a robot what good is it knowing that we care about robots 
there are a couple of interesting applications there have been some very hopeful results in health and education with 
robots for example for quite some time now researchers have been looking at how to engage autistic children with 
because noticed that kids on the spectrum will sometimes respond to robots in a way that we really seen 
and the leading researchers in the field say that this is probably because a robot a very social thing 
they treat as a social actor but it come with all of the baggage that an adult or another 
would have and sc very sympathetic kd yeah yeah very sympathetic robots yeah i agree with that maybe not 
kids on the spectrum chuckle but the interesting thing is not only will they engage with the robot they 
engage more with other people in the room as well if you bring in a robot to play with 
and until now been kind of these oneoff studies in the lab that done but they just recently last 
did a longerterm study in homes where they put roots and homes that they interacted with for half an 
every day for a month and their social skills went upward in a way that sc wow kd on 
measure that we care about for these kids normally this would take thousands and thousands of dollars worth of 
to get those results and they got it with having them interact with a robot now the catch was 
the skills decreased again when they remove the robot at the end of the study but that shows that 
much potential here another example i like to make sc sorry can i just ask before that kd oh 
sc so what kind of robot was it that they were interacting with kd i think they were using 
jibo platform jibo was a consumer product for a few years but recently shut their doors but still used 
a research platform so i think they were using a jibo sc was it something that looked like a 
being or looked like a pet or looked like a fantasy creature kd oh yeah the jibo looks kind 
think the closest thing would be like the pixar lamp so sc oh okay okay kd it has a 
that swivels and looks at you and it has this animated dot in the middle of the head the 
kinda looks like a fried egg but very cute it will move around it really gives you the sense 
interacting with a social being actually really cleverly designed because when you try to make a robot too humanlike 
too close to something that people are intimately familiar with it really disappoints expectations expecting it to behave a 
way whereas if you have this pixar animated thing people are much more likely to suspend disbelief sc but 
interesting because one might have guessed that they would want something that was sort of tactile like furry like 
cat or a dog or something like that but this is manifestly technological kd it is there are furry 
which is the second example i was gonna talk about i suspect they used jibo for this study because 
i mentioned robots are always broken around here and so very very difficult to do a study in homes 
you go and fix the robot and have that consistency that you need for a longterm study and so 
needed to use a product that was stable enough to do that with and i think jibo why they 
jibo sc sure and so what was this other study kd so the other not necessarily a study but 
other robot that i think has a really promising application is the paro a baby seal robot have you 
that one sc no kd so this one has been around for quite some time they use it in 
homes and with dementia patients really cute sc i might have seen it actually yeah now that mentioned it 
yeah and been on tv shows it was on the show master of none gotten some fame but super 
it makes these little movements it gives you the sense of nurturing this baby seal this furry and soft 
the touch and it turns out to be really important for people who are in a situation where just 
taken care of by others their whole life now to be given the sense of nurturing something psychologically really 
for them and i know it sounds super creepy and people are like so weird and gross that giving 
people robots instead of human but what it really is is a replacement for animal therapy and been very 
been able to use it instead of medication to calm distressed patients and so really hard to argue that 
bad thing especially if you stop considering it a human replacement and start looking at it as animal therapy 
a context where we use real animals for a lot of reasons sc yeah i mean i imagine people 
this i get it why would you object to this a therapy is that sort of the dark side 
this fact that reacting on the basis of our instincts not our rationality and people have a reaction that 
is something intrinsically offputting or inhuman about a robot compared to some other strategy kd well i think people 
just struggling with this like in kind of western judeochristian society we have this really stark divide between things 
are alive and things that alive and so our rational brains are like robots machines not and yet our 
behavior towards robots is very much treating them like living things and i think just very confusing to people 
we really sorted that out in our culture yet sc yeah for the autistic kids is there any more 
explanation of what it is where the benefit is coming from why is it that the autistic kids are 
more social in the presence of this robot kd i know not intimately familiar with that not sure that 
researchers actually know for example why the robots worked so well with these kids but certainly an opportunity to 
those things by studying this in more depth sc right i mean for the dementia patients or for the 
you offered an explanation which makes perfect sense to me that something that you get value from not just 
taken care of but taking care of something right you are nurturing that something that is valued i suspect 
no expertise here whatsoever that a lot that we do a disservice to a lot of elderly people by 
all of their responsibilities and authority right like just by trying to take care of them and put them 
a very soft space where they do anything or be hurt and giving them a little bit more autonomy 
be better along many dimensions kd yeah and i guess people like it because they say fake autonomy like 
actually nurturing something and so they think authentic but i feel like the way that we treat people we 
them in front of a tv or we medicate them or like you said we give them no autonomy 
think that this is so much better than what currently doing sc and on the other side the fact 
like it or not being surrounded by robots right like forget about using them for therapy or whatever whether 
in factories or driving cars or in our kitchen do we human beings have to adapt to a new 
of way of dealing with the world when so much of the world is robotic and able to move 
kd well yeah of course i mean also why confused there are some people who are like bad that 
treat robots like living things we need to educate this out of but i think just gonna be the 
normal really because robots are moving into shared spaces right now been behind factory walls and now coming into 
of these new areas like you said into houses into workplaces into transportation systems hospitals the military and i 
we have to roll with it and try to think about whether there are any harms that could come 
interactions with robots whether we need to think about consumer protection issues for example but i really think we 
to be leaning into the positive effects as well within the knowledge that i know this sounds like technological 
but true these robots are coming sc coming no with you there yeah kd you stop that sc i 
do you know much more about robots than i do do you do you have a picture of what 
be like fifty years from now in terms of how robotized our daily lives are gonna be kd fifty 
from now oh a tough one sc you can change the number but yeah kd like if you go 
years back to think of all the changes oh my goodness well i do think that we are gonna 
more robots in households and workplaces than we do right now like right now at the very beginning of 
like having a roomba having an alexa recently some companies have closed their doors that were trying to create 
robots that do a little bit more than those two things they tried and failed but i think that 
slightly before their time i think we will have more and more robots in the household they may not 
rosey from the jetsons they may be more of single task robots but definitely gonna be a huge shift 
think we are entering an era of humanrobot interaction kd right and interesting to me that we treat we 
saying anthropomorphic but not exactly right right because we necessarily treat them like people but like animals right whether 
not they are explicitly made to look so once we get not like you say rosey from the jetsons 
just super roombas gonna be inevitable that we make them more and more human in our minds kd i 
so well so glad you mentioned animals though because i think one of the fallacies that we still have 
that we constantly compare robots to humans and artificial intelligence to human intelligence and whether in stock photo images 
you do a google search for ai you get all these human brains and whether talking about robots and 
replacement i think still very much thinking of robots as like a recreating human abilities and human tasks whereas 
much better to think of them as an animal equivalent doing research on a book on this right now 
looks at all the analogies between our history of animal domestication and how integrating robotic technology now and in 
future because a much better analogy given that ai has such a different skill set than we do and 
could be partnering with it instead of trying to replace ourselves sc right right and that reminds me so 
something controversial here and get comments sure but the issue of how we treat animals just as the issue 
how we would treat robots right and i have a lot of vegetarian followers not a vegetarian myself but 
get that this is an important issue and we should think about it and i try to be openminded 
listen to both sides but one argument is that if you if you raised a pig say from a 
piglet and it became your friend and your pet then you want to kill it and eat it and 
i agree with that and i think that a contradiction or i think a moral failing i think that 
the fact that we grow attached to things animals robots people that we get to know and the problem 
killing it is not that there is some intrinsically bad thing about killing it but that our feelings are 
when that happens and i think a perfectly sensible moral way to live kd wow yeah that is controversial 
laughter kd i agree and disagree with you sc alright kd so i think true that if you look 
the history of animal rights and how treated animals throughout history and today we are such hypocrites and we 
to tell ourselves that we care that animals have consciousness or that they suffer but if you look at 
history which animals protected and which animals we really care about we really decide according to biological criteria i 
up in switzerland people eat horse meat in switzerland in the states that people would never eat horses sc 
kd we have too much of an emotional connection to horses but if you tell that to a european 
european is like the difference between cows and horses both delicious why not eat them so sc right so 
to argue for both sides i wanna say the europeans are completely right what is the difference between horses 
cows but i wanna say if as an american if the culture you grew up in says that you 
turned off by the concept of eating horses then eat them i completely agree that we are hypocritical in 
not in favor of pain and suffering and i think that terrible to animals especially farm animals and so 
and all in favor of attempts to be nicer to the animals that we do raise for livestock but 
different moral dilemma than whether or not okay to eat them if they are raised humanely kd i so 
think that just because we are hypocrites okay to eat them sc no i think okay to eat them 
think that the thing that is not okay is mistreatment right kd but okay killing them sc yeah yeah 
so do you make sure that the meat you eat is humanely raised sc well i prefer it but 
a realist about what actions i can take will change the world i would like laws that make it 
okay to mistreat animals like the same thing with energy conservation right like our water conservation in favor of 
collective action to fix these problems not me trying to be individually virtuous kd a good answer a good 
i have to say though i have too much of paul emotional empathy when it comes to animals been 
vegetarian since january sc oh okay good for you kd yeah yeah yeah i do it you know i 
breastfeeding and realizing that animals nurse many animals that we also nurse their kids and i was just like 
them sc i yeah look a very emotional issue and i think okay and in flux i did see 
i was following on twitter i say who tweeted something about how better for the planet if you eat 
plants and less meat and there were so many responses in the comments along the lines of tell me 
to live my life gonna have a big old and just comments that were pictures of steak and they 
like eat steak this is not a but people who eat meat are just as sensitive and defensive snowflakes 
vegans or vegetarians are so i think any moral high ground anywhere around here chuckle kd absolutely i think 
because they know no justification for eating meat sc alright well possible kd deep down inside the way that 
know no justification for my carbon footprint and flying all over the place like i do sc but you 
right kd i do sc yeah so again and i do it too and i know bad i know 
me stopping change anything really so again in favor of collective action to fix this problem but kd i 
sc okay i think that important because it relates back to the robots because you said and i think 
nowhere near making artificially intelligent conscious robots that we would have to afford the same kinds of protections to 
we would people but in the living kingdom in animals or plants a continuum of consciousness and feelings and 
have to draw that line somewhere and eventually gonna become a much harder question in the world of robots 
would think kd sean i have a question sc yeah kd why do physicists always wanna talk about robot 
is that a physics thing always the physicists sc i think so i actually wanna talk about it one 
right one extreme is the roomba another extreme is artificial intelligence and just making the point that there is 
continuum between them and we are changing so actually i think the philosophers like to talk about it more 
physicists they will instantly leap to the thought experiment whether or not anywhere close to technologically feasible kd oh 
true philosophers also like this sc yeah kd true well as a philosophical discussion i think absolutely warranted and 
i just like i said i think very practical to discuss if looking at the near and mediumterm future 
as far as my eye can see because not gonna have machines that approach the consciousness of anything that 
believe would warrant rights sc right yeah of a mouse not gonna come anywhere close to a mouse right 
yeah and we give the mice rights either sc yeah no exactly right so perfectly fair and i do 
important of what the implications of your work and what studying is much more about how humans deal with 
that we all agree are not conscious so plenty to be learned there given the examples of autistic children 
dementia patients but then we have to start talking about the sex robots people using robots perfectly healthy grownup 
using robots for other kinds of purposes let us say so do you study that is that something you 
about kd i study sex robots i personally would have no problem with it but very hard to do 
research in america i know if tried chuckle sc i have to do either sex or drugs research but 
told by friends who do very very difficult in both cases very puritanical kd yeah you raise money for 
you get ostracized by your colleagues sc yeah kd also the sex robots i think they also get a 
amount of attention like you said have to talk about the sex robots everyone wants to talk about the 
i think some interesting issues when it comes to sex robots and it does tie into some of my 
around does the use of technology influence human behavior but also a lot of kind of sensationalist headlines around 
sex robots we really have any yet sc well right we have sex dolls i guess the reason why 
thought of it was because this issue that we need to make the robots look human in order to 
them i presume that for sex robots it would be since they really exist yet but it would be 
to make them look human or at least some exaggerated version of whatever someone wants kd oh yeah the 
robot that you want because if you go into a sex shop and you look at the sex toys 
for women a lot of them really look dildos that look like dolphins they look like penises sc i 
so women want it to look like men laughter kd i know i know just saying a lot of 
form factors out there but i think jokes aside right that the sex dolls or the sex that we 
seeing on the market do resemble female bodies and specific types of female bodies which also raises some issues 
objectification of women and i believe that sex robots are any sort of replacement for human sexual relationships but 
might be something that people who have human sexual relationships use because better than nothing or they might be 
that supplement sexual relationships so not necessarily concerned about humans being replaced here but i am a little bit 
about the form factors and we just know whether behavior towards sex robots is something that is a healthy 
for example for sexual behavior that we want performed among humans for example pedophilia or whether something that might 
and normalize that behavior and make them want more of it we know and like i said pretty impossible 
research so sc well yeah i guess what i was gonna say so right we know and you could 
imagine it going either way right that having this kind of robot either is an outlet and therefore keeps 
people safe from harm or it encourages it and an empirical question you should study it but saying that 
hard as a practical matter to actually study things like that kd it is i mean in other countries 
germany and canada they are doing some research on pedophilia which you absolutely cannot even do in the united 
for a lot of reasons including legal reasons but as an empirical question also a very difficult one to 
at like the violence in video game debate like the pornography debate we have some research that tries to 
at those questions but not very conclusive very difficult to do these studies but i do think that robots 
reconsideration of these issues because of their physicality i think that so much more immersive and visceral to engage 
a robot than with something on a screen sc and violence is another example which is probably analogous to 
in some sense we could imagine that certain people of violent tendencies and maybe that could be ameliorated if 
could take it out on robots right or it would just encourage them and very analogous to the video 
debate also but is that something where able to do research a little bit easier than the sex question 
i mean the research well anything is easier to do research on than sex in america but that is 
is a very difficult question so you know some of the research been done on humanrobot interaction is starting 
look at connections between tendencies for empathy and how they treat robots like my research but also other people 
looking at this but the question of does interacting with robots change empathy is a more difficult one that 
would like to get at and like to think of ways to get at it but going to take 
while and unfortunate because we kind of need to know sooner rather than later as robotic design gets more 
more lifelike we wanna know whether we need to be policing behavior or having age restrictions on certain robots 
even having legal protections for certain robots that restrict what people can and do with them in order to 
people from becoming desensitized to certain behavior sc yeah so do you collaborate with psychologist sociologist do they are 
studying these questions of how behavior can be changed by dealing with robots in different ways kd you know 
people have reached out to me stopped doing experimental research i done any for a few years because writing 
book right now but when i get back into it planning on getting in touch with people because yeah 
course this is very interdisciplinary work you need people who understand the technology people who understand the psychology and 
difficulty in academia even though nowadays we claim that interdisciplinarity is important the institutional structures always support it that 
and fortunate to be in sc yeah we know that yeah kd well yeah the media lab is pretty 
at it so hoping that i can do some interdisciplinary work on this and collaborate with a few other 
later on sc yeah i mean you mentioned like happening like it or not and as slow as academia 
the legal system is a whole another thing right i did have a podcast with alta charo who is 
bioethicist and law professor and biology is an area where things are changing very rapidly with gene editing and 
babies and so forth and the law is always slow to catch up do you think how good a 
is the law in when it comes to our future robot interactions kd oh terrible terrible and sometimes good 
the law is so far behind like we would not have the internet as we know it if legislators 
gotten their hands on it early at the same time now dealing with you know some consumer protection issues 
privacy issues and other issues because the law is still behind even though had the internet for a while 
a constant struggle especially as the pace of technology really picks up and biology is a great example i 
wow laughter yeah we need people who understand policy and law and understand technology and biology and the cutting 
of innovation to be working together on this that happen nearly enough part of this community of people who 
trying to bring policymakers and roboticists and people who work in those fields together with you know some limited 
some success we have this conference happening every year about to be a policy workshop in dc with a 
of policymakers but yeah a constant struggle the law is usually based on superstition or lobbying sc yeah kd 
not based on evidence sc also reactive right like some terrible thing happens and then we pass a law 
it if a new kind of terrible thing kd oh yeah and we need more evidencebased policy but for 
we also need to have the data to have the evidence that we can point to and in humanrobot 
still some open questions that been explored sc i mean so both what are those open questions and what 
the biggest legal issues in your mind like what do you wish legislatures or at least congressional staffers were 
about kd oh well okay so do you mean like in my personal focus and work or do you 
generally in robotics sc whichever you wanna do first chuckle kd well so my personal focus is really on 
ways that people treat robots like alive even though they know that just machines so the thing that i 
want policymakers to be aware of is or in particular consumer protection agencies is the fact that if you 
the persuasive design that developed in the internet you know getting people to click on buttons because a specific 
using all these tricks from like casinos to get people to interact with their devices more if you take 
and apply it to a social robot just putting it on steroids you know a social robot is gonna 
so persuasive and so engaging to people and that plus capitalism is a recipe for some consumer protection issues 
i think we will need to figure out sooner rather than later so what i think but you know 
that there are many many issues in robotics that that really legal consideration from autonomous weapon systems to responsibility 
harm to automation and the workforce i mean there are so oh my gosh algorithmic bias is a huge 
that fortunately has gotten a lot of attention recently and there are a lot of great people working on 
but yeah a lot going on that needs to be addressed sc actually why maybe not every listener is 
familiar with that what is the issue with algorithmic bias kd so we like to think of artificial intelligence 
being more neutral in this decisionmaking than a person and so if a company and you wanna remove bias 
your hiring process for example you might think a good idea to take an algorithm to train it on 
people have been successful in your company in the past and have it pick applicants instead of having a 
pick the applicants who might be swayed by certain names or who knows what so companies have actually done 
amazon did this recently and got in trouble for it because it turns out if you train an algorithm 
historical data which is what we do with all the algorithms it will incorporate a lot of biases like 
example the fact that you use to hire a lot of women in your company chuckle and so now 
algorithm is gonna be like well women been successful in this company so gonna weed all those kd so 
very simple example but we are seeing these systems being deployed in areas like criminal justice making decisions over 
people get out on bail or not making decisions over whether will people get hired or fired entire rating 
for professions have been automated in this way and heartbreaking because not only is the data usually biased but 
usually have any insight into how these decisions were made a lot of these systems are developed by companies 
gets contracted out in a black box protected by intellectual property or even the algorithm is so complex that 
understand how it came up with the decision we just trust that it was a good one but a 
of problems with this obviously and data scientists fortunately are turning some of their attention towards this sc so 
i mean a garbageingarbageout problem right if you train a computer on your biases it will end up reflecting 
biases kd oh yeah of course the problem with technology in general chuckle oh my gosh we have someone 
at the lab joy buolamwini she does fantastic work a woman of color and she was working on this 
something that required facial recognition and she realized that the system recognize her face because her skin is black 
it would so she had to wear a white mask so that the system would see her and seen 
over and over again like photography automatic faucets in the bathroom facial recognition technology is built by largely young 
white men who think to incorporate different types of skin color as just one example and not their fault 
has blind spots based on their life experience but we need more diversity in the teams that are building 
we need to be aware of the biases and the data that training these systems with and currently i 
a little bit we trust technology a little bit too much to be neutral sc yeah and that goes 
to something you mentioned in passing that i wanna come back to about responsibility and where we put it 
are being done in our world increasingly by automated systems by robots by computer programs and sometimes things will 
wrong sometimes inevitable sometimes it could have been avoided but we have a system when human beings do something 
it goes wrong for blaming them and holding them accountable and holding them responsible and what do we do 
the thing that went wrong is an automated system rather than a biological one kd well it seems like 
unsolvable problem we do have some things that we can draw on throughout history to look at this now 
course this gonna help in cases where we have a black box problem which is why the eu for 
is looking at trying to have transparency in algorithmic decisionmaking so that you can at least see what happened 
the decisionmaking process but when it comes to just these autonomous entities making a decision and causing harm we 
look at animals we do have a history of assigning responsibility when animals have caused harm in the past 
i think of this in particular when we think about robots and automated weapons systems and things where robots 
causing physical harm dealt with this issue throughout history ever since the first laws known to human kind what 
if my ox wanders off and gores someone in the street responsible for that and had different solutions to 
like not like we found the one golden solution it depends a little bit on culture and other things 
we can look at that history and try and draw from it a little bit i was just recently 
to someone at a conference who is involved in a roboticist works on autonomous vehicles and he was talking 
some law makers in england about how to regulate autonomous vehicles and they were like oh well you know 
have this law of the horse from the century that perfectly applies and so they started drawing on that 
not as new a problem as people think sc right okay yeah actually that does make sense and again 
fits in with the we can learn something about how to deal with robots by studying how we deal 
animals more broadly right kd i mean i personally love that analogy it hold for everything of course but 
cool sc well before i forget you mentioned the usefulness of these robots to autistic children or elderly people 
dementia i wanna think about the usefulness of robots in a similar way specifically intentionally anthropomorphise robots to grownup 
people or the majority of people who we think about will we be having increasing robot nannies or robot 
teachers any time soon robot nurses kd well whether we will or not is a different question from whether 
not we should i personally think so boring to just try and create robots that do something that a 
can do i understand that sometimes a need for that for example for a dangerous job that we want 
putting themselves in danger for yeah we might want a robot to automate that but robot nannies or like 
taking on a function that relies a lot on human social factors i think that would be better done 
humans honestly if you look sc not where robots have the comparative advantage right kd no absolutely not and 
argue well there are certain countries where we have overaging populations and we need robots to take because we 
enough people to do caretaking for example but sometimes the problem there is very strict immigration policies and general 
in society that maybe best solved by throwing robots at the problem like maybe we need to have a 
conversation about what it means for example for bluecollar workers lost their job to not want to become a 
because too feminine in their minds we have a lot of jobs in caretaking in the us where people 
needed and at the same time we have people complaining that all of the jobs are getting lost and 
lot of culture and identity and other conversations tied up in that that we might wanna be having rather 
turning to technological solutionism sc i guess yeah okay a good point because i think that one of the 
things that people i think touched on this already first things people think of when they imagine the robotic 
is robots that are exactly like humans that are conscious and look like human beings and even if we 
that aside and say the robots need to be like humans they can be different and have different saying 
we still look at the functions filled by human beings and say if we filled them by and we 
wanna say what if just completely different functions that robots are much better at and we should be looking 
kd yeah i think so much more potential in thinking outside of the box here and thinking about what 
robots good at and how can we use that to make us more productive or have us do our 
i think that way more potential in thinking like that than in thinking of how do we recreate human 
sc yeah right in pasadena right near caltech where i work there is i know if the first but 
is a burger joint that has a robotic burger flipper right chuckle it flips the spatula over the burger 
it you can watch it they sell it as a tourist attraction and i was never quite sure why 
was an improvement over anything kd i mean some novelty effect there i guess sc some novelty effect but 
okay to close then just give you an opportunity to prognosticate a little bit maybe if not directly predicting 
future give us a little bit of a hint for those of us who are not following the latest 
news what we should keep in mind or keep an eye out for in the robotic future not just 
robots but the legal and moral and personal issues that you care about kd well i think one of 
things that people really have trouble wrapping their minds around but as people have more robots in their lives 
getting more comfortable with is this idea that we do treat robots like living things even though we know 
just machines and so having that awareness i think it helps you not be as surprised by it and 
lessen the confusion that seeing in our society at least but another thing that i really wanna point out 
that the way that artificial intelligence currently is being built and learned is by collecting massive amounts of data 
feeding it to the machines and we now have the processing power to be able to do something with 
data and some really cool things but a lot of data collection i think could be problematic for privacy 
kd and something that people think about a lot and even i see it in myself like we have 
alexa at home so practical to be able to order diapers handsfree when you have a toddler and so 
mind having a microphone in our home listening to everything because traded our privacy for that functionality and so 
have an incentive to curb that the companies have an incentive to curb that so we need legislation to 
our backs because i think privacy is really important maybe not for me but for the poor families who 
targeted with advertisements trying to sell them scammy loans or education programs so many examples of how people get 
by all of this data collection and i think we need to be aware of that sc yeah i 
of have a fatalistic attitude towards this i suspect that privacy is just gonna go away i think it 
i think we should try to protect it but people seem that interested in trying to protect it versus 
pressure to give it up and the possible benefits they can get from giving it up kd but like 
have to fight sean sc we do we do kd it impact you maybe as a very privileged white 
but it impacts so many people who are less fortunate and i just lately have to fight this and 
believe that privacy is dead i believe that privacy is an entire spectrum and that if we just let 
unbridled capitalism roll over us gonna find newer and newer ways to just exploit people and so we need 
at least try to slow it down a little sc all right i will take that as a good 
message that we should even if a pessimistic message in the sense that a huge problem facing us an 
one that we can fight and do something about it kd i think so sc all right kate darling 
so much for being on the podcast kd thanks sean music if you think courting advertisers will not change 
content using a tiny fraction of your genius what maybe go a little softer on the whole cosmology thing 
to offend the ark museum crowd an increase in listener number and of course income if we can court 
six thousand year old universe it will happen and you now it um sean the problem with killing a 
that you have raised is that you will recognize the pig as a conscious creature with a personality not 
thing and you would realize that it was not a thing btw a big fan of your podcast please 
go into ads there are other much better ways to make your beloved money and reach a larger user 
in regards to this podcast i was once again shiningly reminded how mentality in usa diverged so much from 
european in the good bad and mostly neutral also i think we are that far silicon consciousness will emerge 
cérebros atribuem significados dotamos esses objetos de emoções sentimentos finalidades no âmbitoterapeutas trabalhos rotineiros que envolvam riscos sim é 
mais valia obrigada sean e obrigada kate darling really enjoyed this podcast as i do all of them nice 
hear topics discussed from opposing viewpoints top marks for diplomatically getting out of the vegetarian section of the topic 
as for the advertising cool with it i mean you are entitled to do as you please and nothing 
free i listen to many podcasts that are ad supported and mind it at all thanks for creating this 
podcast always look forward to the variety of topics discussed this episode demonstrates how careful one needs to be 
making conclusions based on any animal behaviour including homo sapiens near the beginning of the interview kate darling discusses 
experiment that was performed with humans and robots she goes onto to state that within the experiment outlined the 
to take a hatchet and machete to a robot is due to the human the robot and the human 
feelings towards the robot scientists stress the importance of repeatable experiments i agree repeat the robot experiment that kate 
outlined and the repeatable result of the humans involved in the experiment not wanting to go psycho on the 
will be repeated however and this is very important from the experimental results this is all anyone can conclude 
humans involved were reluctant to destroy the machine attributing a reason or reasons why the humans were reluctant without 
ton years worth of added research experimentation and results is egotistical bad science and just plain wrong many reasons 
why someone will not behave a certain way many reasons exist why someone will resist acting in a manor 
is new or foreign to them one could perform an experiment that includes humans and machines that are not 
in any way and the same result would be shown take a group of humans you could even take 
exact same group of humans that were involved in kate robot experiment outlined in this programme and then ask 
humans to take an ax and machete and go apeshi on an old air conditioner or rusted train wheel 
humans would more than likely have the exact same reluctance as they did with the robot experiment that mean 
they have feelings for the old air conditioner or rusted train wheel many humans especially in the west where 
sean carol and kate darling reside as well as myself and the majority of listeners to podcast live in 
stable democratic society meaning that both individual and large groups public of homo sapiens within these societies especially as 
will never act wild and unruly because the majority of homo sapiens in the west do not very often 
ever intentionally act with abandon and try to destroy anything on mere feelings of hatred or some other synonymous 
when asked to take an ax and machete and simply use all of your hatred and strength to recklessly 
something on malice alone is met with reluctance usually indicates that this individual has never acted or felt this 
and forcefully trying to act and feel this way feels foreign there is a feeling of reluctance to do 
the object which would receive the malice essentially being irrelevant meaning that their reluctance to forcefully attack and destroy 
stuffed animal an air conditioner or a robot would be met in the same way meaning that the reluctance 
destroy the robot met by the experimenters has far more to do with the own experiences and feelings towards 
has more to do with the desire not to use reckless abandon because it is totally foreign to them 
it has to do with the feelings towards the object in this case the robot i agree i do 
have enough evidence to completely conclude that it has more to do with western desire to not use reckless 
than their feelings towards robots and a lot more research would need to be performed to make an informed 
conclusion about their behaviour but saying their behaviour is due to their feelings towards the robots based on current 
knowledge is completely unfounded and baseless your sean answer to advertising is simple and can be summed up using 
one of your episodes episode matthew luczy on the pleasures of wine in this episode matthew luczy was able 
speak his mind and tell the truth at least to him about wine and the pleasures of wine he 
many statements about the differences between north american and european wine drinkers makers and savourers he mentioned the uselessness 
the champagne flute he mentioned how ridiculous it is for someone in north america to try and drink champagne 
white wine directly from the refrigerator at fortytwo degrees fahrenheit these are but a few comments from that episode 
would have needed to be removed had you had sponsors whether directly or indirectly these comments would have bothered 
sponsors this episode was almost two hours i said the question was easy i lying is having to be 
of every single word yourself or a guest says and having to edit an episode like episode fortythree down 
thirty or forty minutes in order to be complacent with your sponsors outweighed by the money you would make 
sponsors if the answer is yes then choose to have sponsors on your podcast if the answer is no
