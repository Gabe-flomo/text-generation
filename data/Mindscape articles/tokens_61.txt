mindscape podcast your host sean carroll today very fortunate to have an extremely distinguished scientist antonio damasio is a 
neuroscientist and professor of neuroscience at usc university of southern california here in la where he is also a 
of psychology philosophy and neurology you might remember that a few months ago we talked to lisa azizzadeh who 
works at usc in the brain and creativity institute and we talked about embodied cognition the idea that what 
constituting our thoughts does not come solely from our minds but also from our bodies that our bodies have 
role to play in understanding how we think not just what we do so damasio is the director of 
brain and creativity institute where this interview actually took place and so been a pioneer in this way of 
for many many years sc and in his new book which just came out in paperback called the strange 
of things he sort of summarizes what come to think about this and he emphasizes funnily enough the idea 
feelings in view we take feelings nearly seriously enough when we try to explain how we think how we 
what makes us human beings to damasio what a feeling is is a way of our bodies telling ourselves 
doing with respect to the goal of maintaining homeostasis homeostasis is the condition that our body is in when 
temperature is right our oxygen level is right and so forth and feelings are somehow the very very primal 
that we get from our body that something is not right or that everything is going really really well 
so we actually trace following his book the origin and evolution of feelings from bacteria which even have nervous 
but they have sort of a precursor to the idea of feelings all the way up through evolutionary time 
human beings and in fact we go beyond that not just to individual human beings but to societies and 
damasio tries to argue that the fact that so much of who we are as human beings is rooted 
our feelings is woefully neglected when we think about the origin of things like religion or politics or law 
anything like this any of the ways that human beings get together in a social context sc so i 
both the specific point of view that damasio has about these things and his love for being synthetic and 
many many different areas and mixing them together and seeing how they interact with each other is very similar 
a point of view that i took from a different angle in the big picture in my own book 
we had a wonderfully sympathetic conversation here i think that these are really ideas that are both important and 
as well as a little mindbending so i think this is one gonna like go music sc antonio damasio 
to the mindscape podcast antonio damasio my pleasure sc so written several books but gonna focus on your most 
book and i think what like to do is sort of give away the punchline at the beginning and 
we can go back and build up to it so as far as i can tell the punchline is 
in two words feelings and homeostasis these have a very different vocabulary word level of precision but tell us 
feelings why is a neuroscientist talking about feelings this sounds like gonna share our feelings with each other or 
like that ad be nothing wrong with that no feelings is actually an undeveloped interest that people ought to 
but seem not to and the kind of phenomenon that has been completely forgotten largely because of plain cognition 
the century and into our time we have given a tremendous amount of attention to socalled cognitive phenomena obviously 
thinking processes the processes of reasoning memory sensory processes as well but people have forgotten that there is something 
from a point of view of evolution precedes all of that cognitive development and that has to do with 
with affect with the fact that a living organism and especially a living organism that is conscious and has 
states has a constant qualification of those mental states as favorable or unfavorable to life is good or bad 
and what talking about when we talk about affect and about feelings and mind you as you know from 
the book feelings is by no means a synonym of emotion on the contrary you keyed into two very 
concepts in the book feelings and homeostasis and neither of them is a synonym of emotion emotion is a 
thing that we can talk about so feelings is indeed an incredibly important phenomenon is a phenomenon that i 
only occurs in creatures that have nervous systems and minds you need to have both which mean of course 
it is exclusively human not at all i expect most creatures with a nervous system that is complex enough 
with a complex body to have feelings if they have feelings exactly like ours is a different story but 
essence of feeling is a positivity or negativity something that we can describe with the term valence and that 
to do with how the feeling state is conducive or not to the continuation of life into the quality 
that life valence designates that quality sc so if not just emotions so are emotions are subset of feelings 
a kind of feeling ad no emotions are as the name indicates actions and one of the big problems 
has been so badly served by the confusion of emotion and feeling that is part of the culture of 
culture actually this is quite widespread is that emotions are in fact something that must have preceded feelings and 
consists of certain actions that result in a better or worse adaptation of a living creature to the environment 
when you have a response by some very simple organism that consists of withdrawing you could say that that 
is at heart an emotive response so there is a movement and sc the word motion is in there 
exactly the word motion is in there and emotions such as we commonly know for example fear or the 
of anger or of compassion are collections of actions that produce a certain effect and that result in a 
effect for the individual that is undergoing the emotion and that produce a certain effect outside in other creatures 
in the environment but i like to talk about emotions as concerts of actions that the best technical way 
describing it is action programs sc okay ad whereas feeling and this is very simple feelings are the experiences 
those action programs or going even deeper the experience of the action programs that enact life itself so when 
tell me that feel so and describing wellbeing what i think you are describing is your experience of your 
functioning well functioning in fact in something that if not optimal is in the direction of the optimal in 
of the way the homeostasis is being run inside your organism and when you tell me that feel kind 
what doing is describing the collection of actions its integrated sense that you have that your organism is having 
kinds of actions that sort of describe life at that moment and unfortunately not going so well laughter and 
is on the basis of all of this evolutionarily that then you come to have these highly organized little 
this highly organized packs of actions that we call emotions most typically this is so interesting that people normally 
of emotions quite correctly from the great exemplars they have around them for example fear anger disgust sc happiness 
ad exactly so they go immediately to things that are already highly organized and they think that prior to 
there were already states of affect there were already things that were good or bad for example hunger thirst 
nervousness is that a feeling ad nervousness i would say both sc okay ad and by the way one 
things that you realize is happening here is that our language is extremely limited and we end up having 
same words for the emotive set as for the feeling itself or the mental experience of having the emotive 
so when you say you could be describing the set of actions that constitute your happiness which are certain 
of your metabolism certain parameters of your musculature sc smiling jumping at ad exactly so the attitudes that having 
of which is motor motor all the way down and motor all the way up but you could be 
also this feeling you have which is your mental experience sc and so the feelings precede the emotions i 
maybe by mistake you said earlier emotions precede ad well it depends on what kind of feeling and emotion 
about the very fundamental ones that i like to call homeostatic feelings they follow the actions of your state 
homeostasis so probably better to say that the actions always come first sc okay ad and and by the 
that would be in keeping with the fact that in the beginning it was action it was not thinking 
was not feeling sc you thinking too much when you are a bacterium laughter ad exactly you have minds 
you have is bodies and bodies act and bodies can make movements can sense something can respond and responses 
we talk about responses talking about one of two things either something that is acted by a muscle or 
equivalent something that allows an organism even a single cell organism to move that action or something that happens 
which is the secretion or the release of a molecule an action as well and in fact those are 
primordial action sc an internal action is not one that we would see happening but still an action ad 
exactly sc right ad and then as things get more complicated and eventually as you get nervous systems and 
can access to this benighted state we call mind then we have a variety of experiences that are very 
and that you can describe in relation to the interior and in relation to the outside sc and in 
sense then the summary of feelings is that a way for us to recognize that deviating from this homeostatic 
so probably at this point it would be good to tell our listeners what homeostasis is and so important 
that ad exactly and i think that one thing for our listeners that would be important to say is 
feelings follow homeostasis the key thing in this whole story is of course life and this set of characteristics 
must be observed for life to exist for life to persist and of course homeostasis is a sort of 
of describing this rapidly is a way of encapsulating all of this and it consists of a set of 
that do a number of interesting things one is maintain life so that it can continue moment by moment 
running in essence to make it a little bit more complicated running metabolism using sources of energy and using 
sources of energy to maintain a machine which is made whether it is one cell or many cells in 
tissues and organs it make any difference you need to feed those cells with sources of energy and you 
this beautiful exchange that is really the heart of what metabolism is about really an exchange ad and you 
cells alive and when you have multiple cells they are integrated in such a way that they realize certain 
and they sense around which is important if going to feed and they respond if coming with a poke 
could destroy an organism so already from the getgo a way of leading that organism into the conditions that 
essential for its maintenance the primary one of which is the acquisition of sources of energy and defending itself 
we have these two things you are not going to continue living if you allow yourself to be crushed 
not going to continue living if you have a way of transforming a product external to the organism into 
source of energy so that you maintain the machine going sc good i mean two things that are in 
that i really wanna tease out before we get into the main part chuckle of our conversation one of 
is this idea which said myself in talks homeostasis is a form of stasis in some sense you know 
can sit quietly meditating not moving very much but a very different kind than the table being static and 
moving ad exactly sc this kind that requires constant upkeep and this constant fuel injection and below the surface 
lot going on ad absolutely really about activity getting back to the idea that the reason why emotion and 
are keys to what talking about is that all about activity in a way a very interesting when you 
the last thing that it produces is stasis sc right ad i think that the source of the utilization 
that radical stasis is from the idea that a maintenance of something which is in abstract the living condition 
not static at all constantly activity and for me the best analogy is the analogy of the jongleur that 
throwing sc the juggler we would say yes chuckle ad the juggler which is throwing balls up in the 
and is constantly having to be extremely precise about where going to be so that the balls start falling 
once one of them starts falling then the rest will follow but all about activity and something that in 
juggler analogy you also capture is how unnatural it is you see i think that people of course are 
by life and it looks very natural well it really sc it requires some upkeep ad it requires upkeep 
is an uphill battle why it is so vulnerable and why you need all sorts of devices to keep 
going sc right ad and of course they are already extremely powerful at the level of the single cell 
then they become incredibly powerful when talking about multicellularity even if talking about a simple insect let alone where 
about a mammal such as we are and then when you look at the big creatures you realize something 
is that homeostasis again because of that stasis root is very connected with stability you have the idea of 
that is in balance but it is not in balance and constantly struggling about not that homeostasis is the 
point in life no a range of possibilities and within that range you could then describe values that come 
of life and that we have arbitrarily given names such as goodness or badness health and disease and you 
describe a level that is optimal or a level that is soso and is mediocre but there are all 
these different levels that are there in the process and interesting because our language at least gives us or 
languages give us some possibilities of describing this with words such as for example wellbeing wellbeing describes something that 
the general distribution of states of life goes towards the good but something like flourishing describes something even better 
more dynamical ad more dynamic more rich more expansive in the way it extrudes itself from the organism and 
with the environment malaise is one thing but being sick with cancer is something else sc sure ad and 
are all of these different grades of homeostasis and of the descriptor that we have in most languages we 
all of these marvelous words to describe everything between sickness and death and flourishing and happiness sc on twitter 
i said that we ever get true humanlevel artificial intelligence until computers can be bored and this is my 
of cheeky way of pointing out you turn on a computer it can just sit there it feel the 
to do anything and this sort of the role of feelings and homeostasis in biological life is an aspect 
not only we but maybe we even try these days to capture in that artificial environment ad yeah i 
absolutely right and i think that one of the problems with artificial intelligence is the way it has been 
very artificially thinking about that are made of rigid materials materials that bend materials that have a minimum of 
and that is exactly the opposite of what life is all about sc not this constant churning ad no 
is about the vulnerability and the juggler trying to keep this thing which is the most unnatural you can 
in the artificial for example when you think of most of the robots that one can think of as 
and very successful there are things that are you can destroy them with an axe and by a real 
of violence but they will not get sick not only they get bored they get sick either nor are 
very happy the robot that cleans your floor is not gonna be happier as a result of doing a 
cleaning job and sean on that point also something interesting so very interested in that issue because i think 
way in which the problems of feeling the whole issue of feeling can be brought into robotics into artificial 
in general and there is an interesting development that has to do with soft robotics which sure aware of 
and that has to do with materials that emulate a little bit some of the properties of living things 
as for example movements that are movement of a cyclops and with materials that bend as opposed to material 
know arms that are made of rigid parts articulated in the most comical fashion possible when you compare them 
the way a limb and muscles really operate and i think that but a lot of that still does 
aim at the critical issue of feeling the critical issue of feeling potentially can be dealt with if we 
designs of robotics in which we have that vulnerability in other words trying to solve the problem in a 
that looks illogical because instead of trying to create a machine that is super robust the logic if going 
do something that in any way emulates life is to make it vulnerable sc and also the ability to 
repair itself when that vulnerability takes place ad exactly and so of course we are very far from that 
i think a very important idea and actually here at the bci we have an interest in that we 
been talking about this one of my young colleagues kingson man is actually working on that problem and we 
that it deserves attention also very interesting because the community is more receptive to it now sc getting there 
ad yeah i remember the first times that i talked in public a little bit like you and i 
say not serious about conferring feelings or any kind of useful mind truly intelligent mind to a device such 
and people would be extremely offended and probably i was not doing it the right way either but now 
have become very receptive and had numerous instances in which people say well absolutely right that makes and i 
it also comes from the fact that people are now more ready to accept homeostasis as a very important 
of what we are as living creatures and feelings is a very good proxy once you have nervous systems 
mind which of course are late developments in the history of life sc right but this is part of 
bigger message which is when talking about ai in a robot that when thinking about what minds are you 
them from bodies they came from bodies they still are embedded in bodies ad exactly sc and that needs 
be taken into account ad exactly and a lot of very interesting to all sorts of almost each one 
these topics could be a topic for one of your programs sc i know chuckle ad chuckle but just 
of the fact that when you have a mind you normally think of it as unconnect to a body 
you think of it now especially after the huge success of the past one hundred years of biology and 
you think of it as in relation to the nervous system alone now this is very very wrong sc 
other words not the rest of the body just the nervous system ad not the rest of the body 
one of the points that trying to make with the strange order of things and why there is the 
order and strangeness in the title is that it begin that way it had life on earth for most 
the existence of life this long history which is almost four billion years we have had nervous systems perhaps 
five hundred million this is a pittance in most of that time we had extremely complex living creatures first 
many nucleus even single cells no nucleus or membrane but then multicellularity and then in the creation of systems 
as for example the endocrine system the immune system circulation all of these things preceded the appearance of nervous 
and guess what they were conferring even with that socalled simplicity which is nothing like simple they were conferring 
those creatures a possibility of extremely intelligent behavior that allowed them to socialize or not socialize allow them independence 
the energy around was sufficient to maintain that life or allow them to create alliances with others likeminded except 
was no mind sc polyaffiliation yeah ad exactly polyaffiliation and allowed them to fight or to do incredible things 
as pretending that no conflict and moving away to another site in other words you have singlecell creatures that 
for eons in ways that if you were describing them without saying it was a single cell creature and 
were simply making a notation some sociological notation of the attitudes of the creature you would immediately attribute intentions 
mind purposes and all of those things well they do have purposes they do have intentions except that they 
not expressed in the way your intentions or mine are expressed which is through a thinking process in which 
identify a goal and we try to execute that goal because we have a mind and we have that 
because we developed at a certain point a nervous system but all of these are sort of late developments 
we have this huge spectacular history of life with intentions with presumed purposes protecting life through and through because 
becomes the purpose the unspoken purpose and but that was all there prior to nervous systems and minds sc 
part of the role part of the usefulness in telling that story is a slightly deflationary role in the 
that when we think of ourselves and we think about feelings and consciousness and other things like that just 
for us to imagine that this is purely mechanical and plenty of our colleagues who give in to the 
to assign something nonmechanical nonmaterialistic nonphysical to it but if you dig back into the evolutionary history you see 
of everything and so i maybe you can even go into a little bit more detail about specifically bacteria 
how they act and bacteria are pretty much the most primitive organisms that we have around it has they 
single cells they even have a nucleus but like you said they team up and this is true even 
bacteria today and was presumably true of bacteria billions of years ago ad yeah exactly yeah and they team 
they have a very rich social life and that social life can depend on the environment you see all 
this again it pushes us into this core issue of life management and homeostasis so for example if they 
in the terrain that is extremely fertile and that offers sources of energy galore bacteria actually live there independently 
can be isolated but sc introverts ad introvert but if they are in the situation of scarcity if not 
feeding material or if they are under threat then they will group together and they form a coalition that 
them to defend themselves and they do that for example the kind of bacteria that can attack your throat 
mine and give us laryngitis for example doing exactly same thing they will go into that terrain they are 
an aggressive mode and they want to feed off your tissues our living tissues and then of course going 
provoke a reaction and our organism is going to try to defend itself against them and then they the 
are going to try to defend themselves against the defense of our organism and they can for example form 
palisade and produce chemical substances that will isolate them from the actions of our organism or the actions of 
that we may take so that all of this game is being played by these little creatures that you 
not see without a microscope and that have a cell but that have a life to defend come what 
even if they know they have a life sc and probably none of us would say that in some 
if this is a valid formulation that the bacteria truly have intentions planning desires or whatever but i think 
point is that when you look at how they actually behave you see the behaviors that later evolved into 
and desires ad exactly so there is something very beautiful in the fact that this plan of life the 
it operates is organized contains these devices these strategies and all of those strategies then become more expressed as 
have a multicellular body and as you have for reasons that have to do with multicellularity a controller because 
see that the reasons why you end up having a nervous system is that as your body grows bigger 
a multicellular way what was very easy to control in terms of the release of a chemical molecule that 
diffuse and would be sort of noted everywhere in that little body now becomes very difficult to exert that 
because you no longer can expand that all over a bigger organism so you have a nervous system and 
nervous system is helping you control the stuff helping you for example coordinate the motility ad is helping you 
a certain sector working in a certain way once you develop say something like a heart beating that needs 
do the propulsion of blood inside a tubular structure so all of these things are constantly being developed with 
logic and that logic is the logic of life and of course the way it operates evolutionarily is another 
but as if you could constantly tell the story as look gonna have single creatures with life no nucleus 
you give them a nucleus the story gets more complicated then you give the multicellularity then you give them 
nervous system to help with multicellularity otherwise you cope with that ad and then eventually you come to this 
beautiful and unexpected development which is the possibility of creating maps of what is going on within the structure 
within a body and of what is going on outside and through emergence of minds it is very beautiful 
on the on the side which has to do with the interior where you make maps of what is 
on inside your body the line that is going to lead you towards feeling whereas the side that looks 
what is outside and uses eyes or ears to pick up on sounds or the morphology of structures something 
gives you access to the exterior but those are exactly the same things that you and i have in 
organism except we have it with an enormous wealth that not every creature does but that duality what goes 
the inside and what goes to the outside is very critical and maybe you want to go there sc 
go there laughter ad i can tell about the things that have to do with the interior that are 
fabulously beautiful so probably the most important for your listeners is the fact that when you think if you 
the man on the street or any of our colleagues that has not thought about these problems where do 
come from the person will say brains obviously we cannot have minds without that sounds logical enough and just 
it many times when i was talking about the emergence of minds the issue is that although brains are 
for the making of minds as we know them it follow that all the aspects of mind come exclusively 
nervous systems and here we enter a realm that is absolutely central to currentday neuroscience and to philosophy of 
is that we have been in a very bad way attributing minds exclusively to nervous systems to the point 
people will say you have minds because you have chains of neurons firing using and thus of course where 
come from sc we call it neuroscience ad exactly and people are very happy with this well not as 
as that because when you look at this huge world of affect the world of feeling and the emotions 
can be associated with it you actually realize that this is not being generated primarily out of the nervous 
but with the participation of the nervous system where the stuff is coming from is guess what your body 
your muscles whether the striated muscle with which you can move an arm or the smooth muscles which are 
blood vessels and which can be tight or loose but are absolutely critical to the maintenance of an organism 
what is being imaged mentally in relation to affect is actually those phenomena that have to do with the 
so when you think about feeling when you think about feeling anxious for example or when you think about 
very relaxed and happy what you are describing or what you are experiencing is actually a state of the 
that is being described mentally thanks to a coalition of your body structures and your nervous structures and the 
together that are creating the foundation of mind which is your state of affect ad of course we have 
inverted things in the century by going completely crazily into a cognitive track ignoring feeling and emotion and thinking 
thinking as if it were the true substance of mind sc as if we were brains in vats ad 
right you had synapses and firing and so forth and this is crazy in many ways first of all 
totally denies the reality that dealing with in the partnership of bodies and nervous systems but then it also 
something else is that the nervous system by and large does not work only in the way that is 
in the typical brain in a vat scenario our brains our nervous systems are quite synaptic no question about 
but then this huge world of nonsynaptic transmission and contacts which uses different rules so when you have the 
text book neurons and synapse you have an axon that connects via a synapse to another neuron and that 
in the most advanced form is myelinated so that axon has been insulated so that it leak current and 
actually protected from the influences of the perineural space ad when you go to the interoceptive system the system 
brings into your central nervous system signals that have to do with your skin with your interior with the 
with your gut or all of that stuff that comes via spinal ganglia and that comes via nerves such 
the vagus nerve all of those all of those neurons are not myelinated so they are not insulated and 
are open to the vagaries of the surround sc listening to their environment ad listening to their environment and 
there are all of these molecules that can have an influence so yes this neuron is eventually going to 
but not going to fire in the same predictable way that the neuron that was insulated will do it 
gonna be different gonna be modulated by the environment and by the way this is not a small amount 
neurons this is probably the majority of neurons in our nervous system operate this way not only that the 
ganglia which come all along the spine you have this ganglion with a bunch of cell bodies those ganglia 
our trigeminal ganglion which has everything has to do with our head not an unimportant part of our body 
of that is open in terms of bloodbrain barrier ad so instead of having a bloodbrain barrier which selectively 
molecules from crossing and entering the central nervous system on the contrary open which means that the stuff that 
circulating what taking what you have been drinking or what you have been taking is going to have an 
over how that operates which really means that not only do you have this huge participation of the body 
the operations of mind but even the nervous system transmission of signals from one to the other is influenced 
the state of the body so a very complicated picture that has nothing to do with brain on a 
put it this way sc but part of our prejudice that the thinking cognitive conscious part of our brain 
is coming up with these games and it prejudices it puts itself at the top right ad exactly yeah 
i think that by the way one of the big difficulties on the issue of consciousness which we can 
agree has become one of the most popular topics in neuroscience and in psychology and cognitive science in general 
that the conception that you have of how minds are made by nervous systems or by bodies in general 
going to influence the way you think about consciousness and i think that by and large the traditional views 
not been favorable to a clearer view of what we have in front of us and i think that 
a little bit offensive to some people but i think that the problem is far simpler than normally taken 
saying simple just saying that the idea of a hard problem that you cannot transpose i think is wrong 
i did have as a previous podcast guest we had david chalmers on the podcast who is the champion 
the hard problem of consciousness separating out the easy problems of action and perception from the hard problem of 
experience right and i notice that in your book you take two pages to solve the hard problem of 
and then move on ad right what it deserves no no no not gonna joke about it because more 
than that the reason why the section on consciousness actually became much smaller in the book is that i 
decided quite some time ago to write something on consciousness alone and then there was so much on consciousness 
it the book is about the strange order of developments in biology in general in relation to homeostasis and 
not about conscious although all of this story on homeostasis and feeling is absolutely critical for conscious decisions sc 
i was going to say if i understood those two pages i think that the efforts seem to ad 
the way there are exaggerate it sc are there but the hard problem i think that there was only 
ad oh okay very good maybe sc but i thought it also not that convinced that the hard problem 
a true problem gonna be struggling with for many years and i think that what but then if i 
channeling david chalmers here in my role as the podcast host he would say some fundamental difference between how 
act in the world our objectively seen motions and statements versus our inner and what you try to be 
to be saying is that if you just look at evolution and you just look at the existence of 
trying to maintain homeostasis you would naturally find if you were smart enough that it makes sense for organisms 
develop the properties of having inner is that a fair way to say it ad absolutely absolutely yeah and 
think that you things that for example are very interesting and that are not clear is at which point 
develops for example the relation between consciousness and feeling so tight that one could say that definitely you cannot 
one without the you can not have a conscious organism that would not be at the same time a 
organism and another thing interesting that you can say is that when you tell me that you have a 
feeling you tell me that because conscious if you were not conscious you could not tell me that so 
two things are completely associated and i think that if i would have to venture this is exactly where 
began it began first out of necessity because feeling being the representative of homeostasis is the critical issue that 
to be a guide needs to be there rather for how going to continue life and then it made 
and it was good and obviously it was selected because it was so favorable evolutionarily it made sense for 
to know that that was happening because ad by the way sean you may want to point your listeners 
the fact that throughout a good part of the history of discussions on feeling especially in the century people 
to say monstrous things such as useless something that you can do without what you want is to be 
you want to speak well represent well in words what you have thought abstractly do equations do the math 
new objects do all of these things but feelings are absolutely unnecessary in the middle of all this forgetting 
fact that you would not have done any interesting things if you did not have feelings to protect your 
or to invigorate you to pursue a certain goal you extract feelings from the machine and the machine stops 
why why continue sc this sounds like a very american perspective this feelings matter kind of thing you said 
your book was more popular in europe than in the us ad well i know if there would be 
reasons for that but anyway yes it could be it could be i think that certainly an attitude that 
come from the huge success of a number of sciences and the huge success of the realization that complex 
is of course the way into great science and technology not going to do science and technology with feeling 
but not going to do good science and technology without feeling sc not going to be interested in doing 
of it right ad exactly so why would you care sc the physicist in me thinks of this evolutionary 
sketched out as a series of phased transitions right from nonlife to life and then to eukaryotic life with 
then multicellular life and you mentioned the importance of images internal images so where does so we have images 
both ourselves and the outside world inside of us inside of our brains does that happen do we develop 
gradually or does that sort of appear on the scene at some point that capability ad both it had 
appear at a certain point the possibility of imaging and by the way best talking about images to talk 
maps because that sort of cues people into the idea of how it could be made sc a relationship 
yeah a relationship really mapping plotting something in terms of another material in terms of another medium so i 
plot on that wall by making a sketch that has those frames of those pictures that idea if you 
do this whether the visual which is of course the easy one to explain but you can do this 
relation to what you touch you can do this in relation to what you hear and when you come 
smell and taste you do this in terms of the consequences of certain molecules that you are processing but 
mapping function appeared of course it required nervous systems if we have nervous systems you would not have you 
the paper to create the copy sc right ad you needed a substrate sc a place to store the 
ad exactly to depict it and to eventually to store it in memory so nervous systems are key there 
the nervous systems probably started doing a dual mapping of certain things in the outside that were very important 
certain things inside that were also important and those happen to be just not very beautiful perhaps in the 
so why this discussion very often people talk about the gut as the second brain and pretty comical because 
was the first brain sc chronologically it was first ad chronologically it is the first at first we were 
of floating digestive systems and you had a gut and the nervous system was there to create peristalsis to 
action to that but of course at the same time if you have digestion you were having digestion of 
that you ate and in order for you to eat you better have some sense of where the thing 
going to eat was and that comes from the sensing of the outside so it probably codeveloped the internal 
internal mapping and the external mapping and of course still with us today and not by chance that so 
of the feelings you have actually relate to the gut sc yeah ad for example anxiety a lot of 
fundamental expressions have to do with it what happens in the gut so is highly conserved and you can 
that nonhuman creatures probably have something quite similar the other is of course respiration because a lot of our 
lot of the feelings that have to do with our wellbeing are tied to the kind of air flow 
have does the air flow easily or is it constricted sc right ad but again all of those things 
under autonomic control you tell your bronchi to constrict it can give you an attack of asthma they do 
the right molecules are there sc did you ever read de la man a machine ad oh yes many 
i promise you that i read the whole thing but there was a time my descartes time sc i 
a course at the university of chicago for undergraduates on the history of atheism and de la mettrie was 
of the first people to come out in public as a selfproclaimed atheist and funny that he names his 
man a machine because in fact he puts a lot of emphasis on the body and he says a 
person when had coffee and when not had coffee how can you possibly think my mind is separate from 
ad no no no there were plenty of smart cookies then sc right but okay so now half an 
ago i said there were two aspects of homeostasis i wanted to tease out got one of them the 
is this future directedness of it so i think that people would think of homeostasis if they looked it 
in the dictionary as maintaining some features maintaining our existence within this controlled set of parameters where we can 
but you have this extra aspect that is almost teleological that is sort of planning for the future was 
did that come in was that always there is that a late development on the scene ad in terms 
evolution sc yeah ad or in terms of my thinking sc oh no in either one but evolution is 
i was thinking of ad yeah anyway okay both in terms of my thinking it came late but so 
and this is why so important not to describe homeostasis as just balance so again a range of possible 
that are compatible with life but then there is this aspect that has to do with in a way 
could call it and you could force yourself into calling it a prediction a sort of internal knowledge nonexplicit 
knowledge that there are certain conditions under which likely to go under likely not be salvageable and that you 
to protect yourself for such conditions and one of the easy ways to protect yourself in these circumstances is 
hoard up material that is essential as energy supply so one of the reasons why so obvious that people 
the homeostatic machine is not just giving you the say the thirst or the hunger for a certain amount 
food and then you stop no it actually lets you overeat or overdrink so that you can have some 
for the rainy day and they come in handy and by the way interesting that from a general human 
of view so interesting that people who have very severe diets and who actually do something quite unnatural which 
not eat anything and going to a state of enormous thinness those people are actually vulnerable sc to disease 
to diseases sc they have the resources ad exactly so we need some of those resources we need to 
fat but we need to have fat stores for example for the moments in which you have a disease 
when you have a disease going to have a huge consumption of those products and if you have them 
go under and so one part that has to do with the future and then of course you have 
constant for creatures that are thinking you have the constant utilization of the states of feeling by past experience 
allow you to construct a better future where you will not fall into the dangers you fell before and 
forth so where a a primary feeling system can give goods to a thinking system and again so important 
without those guides without the fact that you not only have experienced pain and have experienced say hunger but 
reflected on it because you stored that memory and you have had the possibility of bringing it back and 
have the possibility of having certain warning signs that will bring that memory back ad and what is constantly 
in you to correct your behaviors why inconceivable that gonna have a social life in the ample sense of 
term if you are not guided by feelings of every kind of the feelings that have to do with 
for example having been loved or having been ostracized all of those things are going that were experienced memorized 
effect not as a feeling because interestingly we make memories of feelings which is sc really ad yeah chuckle 
interesting just think if made memories of all the pains you have suffered for one thing there would be 
child birth laughter sc well true you would never write a book laughter ad so another so you actually 
memories of the mental experience of suffering or of joy for that matter what you do is maintain a 
of commentaries on those things and then you can reactivate by something i call the body you can reactivate 
semblance of the state you lived through but this interplay that of course involves not just feeling but thinking 
feeling and memory that is what is guiding a lot of our activity and of course the kind of 
that allowed the creation of cultures sc yeah so good exactly where i want to get to i mean 
being pretty ambitious going from bacteria to us and consciousness and the whole thing guided by this interplay of 
and feeling but you correctly i think point out also a story to be told about how we become 
and how we talk to each other and how we develop culture ad yeah yeah how we develop all 
instruments that again with the typical lack of concern for the feeling component of humanity people attribute just to 
thinking so very smart people and we reason beautifully and why developing moral systems laughter come on we just 
develop moral systems because we are naturally informed of things that are good for you and compatible with happiness 
you also develop the knowledge that they are good for other people so you have the guide or the 
the originals that are going to shape what is your moral behavior are coming out of your knowledge sometimes 
paying too much attention to it of what it is to experience life to suffer and to be ecstatically 
and you either want other people to have that or you or you want to make them suffer but 
of that comes out of that core information ad so the way we develop moral and by the way 
systems that would come from the same tissue from the same set of phenomena the way we do out 
that systems of justice the way we create for example systems of governance systems that include economics and diplomacy 
so forth all of that comes out of this core of feeling reasoned through an intelligent system so once 
we are in this sort of apparent dilemma which is not that you cannot do any of this without 
you cannot do any of this in a complex way without language to express that thinking but nor can 
do it without feeling the two things have to be together if you just have feeling obviously not going 
become a modern philosopher but if you are very very smart and not feeling better not be a moral 
or gonna be awful sc is this a reflection of david hume saying reason should be the slave of 
passions ad well i think david hume was a brilliant thinker on exactly the same note sc yeah ad 
think one of the people that i very much respect and there are some people that are sort of 
of mine because they got it when they might not because the knowledge there hume is one of them 
is another in very different actually spinoza probably is the most unexpected and profound because so simple but the 
got it he realized what was life he realized this idea of the conatus the forces that were impelling 
in a certain direction so he of course he have the word homeostasis but he was describing all of 
he was describing life conditions that are good or not so good he was describing a root for moral 
in these fundamental conditions and putting it all in terms of moral systems and philosophy of action in the 
and so forth sc spinoza seems like one of those philosophers who is often neglected or forgotten but always 
whole bunch of people saying forget this chuckle actually had a lot figured ad you are quite right and 
in the american tradition spinoza is very much ignored sc yeah ad spinoza is through and through a european 
and i remember when i wrote my book about spinoza a book called looking for spinoza and i got 
review by philosophy philosopher reviewer that shall be nameless who said that i had written a book about a 
something quite not only was he not terribly appreciative of my work chuckle but he was even less kind 
to spinoza ad spinoza was a minor philosopher sc well the times change ad the times have changed sc 
so if i wanna push back a little bit sure organisms we want to maintain homeostasis developed this capability 
our minds to have maps and images of the future and plan and be social but does would karl 
worry if we were here that this is too good to be true it can explain everything you do 
about religion a little bit in your book and you say on one hand religion has some aspects that 
us have good feelings and maintain homeostasis on the other hand it has some aspects that make us feel 
and get into wars and people are are we still reaching for more explanatory precision here or is this 
we can hope for ad no i think we can get much more precision on them i think obviously 
want to have more precision in the description of the phenomena themselves and how how for example the phenomena 
feeling have acquired the power that they have but something that i think answers your question which has to 
with the enormous confusion under which we are when we make clear distinctions between both feelings and emotions that 
positive versus negative for example quite typical for you to read some politician or some pundit that says we 
to be rational individuals we know how to think and the last thing we want is to give this 
become too how many times a week do you read in the main newspapers that certain bad things happen 
people are being too emotional the curious thing is that every time that people make that accusation they are 
to negative emotions chuckle not to positive emotions sc be too joyful yeah ad exactly nobody is claiming that 
get into all these problems because of being over joyful and hopeful for the world and being magnanimous and 
full of generosity or compassion or admiration for others well those are emotions and the respective feelings and those 
a huge amount of what our effective life is what we do have though is fear and anger and 
and contempt and many other thing and pride and all of these things which are the ones that get 
into wars and into conflicts that are tragic sc they serve uses as well ad and they serve uses 
of course they are there they were conserved because guess what we were saved evolutionarily by tons of fear 
by tons of anger because if we have the fear we would have been eaten by some other creature 
killed and if we have anger we would have been killed by the guy who had the bigger gun 
they were useful but the question is that not useful all the time you need to know the time 
which you should use those because you are under the control of reason ad so the idea well you 
these problems because being overemotional is silly you have the problems because you can use the wrong emotions and 
use the wrong emotions if you have a layer of control over your emotional apparatus that comes out of 
comes out of thinking comes out of information sheer knowledge that says stupid do and where you can get 
combination of the two sc i had paul bloom on the podcast earlier and he wrote this wonderful titled 
called against empathy ad yep sc and his argument if i can cartoonishly summarize it was we tend to 
empathy sounds good but we empathize with people like ourselves and instead of doing that we should be rational 
morality and how to behave and so forth and i tried to argue against him number one he agreed 
with the first one which is your initial motivation to be rational has to come from somewhere to be 
has to come from somewhere but number two i thought that if just being empathetic with people like yourself 
might be a natural trap to fall into but the diagnosis be you have too much empathy is that 
empathy wrong chuckle that you should try to train yourself to be empathetic with people unlike yourself because otherwise 
will think being rational but you will discount their experience ad absolutely i entirely agree with you and i 
that comes to the point that thanks to our reasoning abilities and thanks to our knowledge we have possibilities 
shaping and controlling the affective system not to suppress the effects but use it better and use it well 
sc right yeah a give and take ad yeah and this dismissal of emotion as something irrational is just 
because a lot of the time it and even if it were irrational in some if it is irrational 
some circumstances no reason why you should not strive for doing better and doing it under rational control so 
to do reason instead of emotionally feeling is to use reason to control to select and control the most 
emotional and the most appropriate affective response and i think an entirely different world sc yeah yeah so good 
leads me into my final question already talked a little bit about the implications of this point of view 
artificial intelligence and we also talked about how this point of view helps explain and account for the emergence 
culture and so forth what are the lessons for culture and society going forward from this understanding of why 
have culture and society in the first place at a point in our human history as liberal democracies and 
forth where nerves are frayed where people are feeling anxious a lot of debates which are carried out at 
very superficial level but have i think deeper resonance about identity who belongs in our culture who we should 
on our tribe on our team is there something that some bit of wisdom or maybe just some practical 
for guiding our society once we have this better understanding of why we have society in the first place 
yeah an excellent question i think that probably the best message look we know a little bit more about 
we function and this schism between a rational creature or an affective creature is false this is fiction this 
not accord with our nature and then try to learn as much as possible about how your nature functions 
example in the kind of conflicts that you are referring to so typical now especially with the enormous power 
social media what we need is to defuse the kneejerk reaction that is caused by giving in to the 
easy provocation of anger or fear especially anger something about the reactions of anger and manipulated beautifully by political 
so that if something that you want achieved make sure that people will go for it with anger generally 
some cause or kind of person ad and so i think that knowing how this works from the inside 
no illusions about the fact that either just purely smart people theoretical physicists my example chuckle well knowing that 
bad people with bad emotions more complicated than that and try to move forward by having one influence the 
now not easy and i think most of the time these days more pessimistic than optimistic about having a 
success come out of our struggles but certainly not going to get any success if we realize what we 
humanly in general in terms of our life and this peculiar thing that is having a mind in a 
complex living creature and starting with that with a little bit of humility is probably the best sc i 
going making it more local bringing it down we always affect the world but do you think that the 
you live your life has been importantly colored by this way of thinking about what a mind is ad 
thought about that i guess so i guess so yes i would say so and certain choices that made 
were probably influenced by that sc well good advice for then people listening to buy the book and maybe 
make better informed choices alright antonio damasio thanks so much for being on the podcast ad thank you sean 
you had read strange order of prior and it is indeed a great book enjoyed this discussion and found 
distinction between and actions useful very interesting seemingly throwaway comment on how the the idea that can perhaps shed 
onto why certain religious sentiments have such a longstanding hold on humanity for example christianity like all compelling religions 
some significant emotions fear of eternal damnation joy at the deliverance of christ sadness and selfeffacement at own iniquity 
shortcomings loneliness and alienation when considering the situation of christ abandoned on the cross social jubilation in the company 
other believers ingroupoutgroup dynamics etc per james wathey the other sense triggered by this and other religions may be 
feeling of being protected and accepted by an allpowerful parental figure it would be interesting to see if further 
can tease apart such connections in a formal way sean thank you for this interesting interview with damasio he 
a highly respected figure in neurobiology and his contributions cannot be overestimated nevertheless i had to make a great 
to keep myself from yelling at my ipod he indeed has created an elaborate castle of words the scientific 
of which however is doubtful fortunately i did not have to yell and wake up my sleeping wife because 
asked the crucial question would karl popper too bad that you never pressed the point though popper would have 
is a falsifiable as he demanded of freud and einstein no doubt theory like can explain a lot after 
fact but without a testable hypothesis that can be proved wrong it is not in your introduction you pointed 
that dr damasio is professor of psychology philosophy and neurology i must assume that he was talking as a 
rather than a psychologist i can live with that perhaps he does not think of psychology as a science 
i do bill mckim grande admiração por este senhor antónio damásio muito interessante o desenvolvimento do diálogo a minha 
de ler este artigo produziume um sentimento de felicidade interessante a sua perspetiva de sentimento homeostatico obrigada sean carroll 
antónio damásio i began listening to mindscape because a squirrel or something similar got into the ducting in my 
toyota camry and destroyed the connection between my radio and its antenna not kidding i have since forgiven the 
because i now understand such a random act is the nature of nature i often wonder about the way 
are so greatly enjoyed many of podcasts to date the conversation with dr damasio was my favorite many interesting 
were made during this conversation about the integration of the body and mind very thought provoking thanks much great 
thanks you remarked twitter recently i said that we ever get true humanlevel artificial intelligence until computers can be 
what worth i wrote an ai system in two thousand one that had boredom sure i the first this 
so frustrating how come you agreed unquestioningly with his response that feelings are necessary to explain behaviour the hard 
of applied to is that you dont need the feelings to explain the movement of the atoms etc until 
get to the problem of who or what is doing the measuring which is kind of the hard problem 
a different form he is right that feelings explain behaviour and the physicists are right that quanta atoms and 
etc do but that is why the hard problem of consciousness is such a real and hard problem because 
can explain why both explanations work pingback may reading and listening list wasafiri consulting comments are closed sean carroll
