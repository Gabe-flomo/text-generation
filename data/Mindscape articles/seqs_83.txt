we see people like us the same part of our brain reacting is when we react ourselves as people become more and more different differences in age or ethnicity or gender or sickness or whatever does that make it harder to empathize la yeah okay so if you think about this
see people like us the same part of our brain reacting is when we react ourselves as people become more and more different differences in age or ethnicity or gender or sickness or whatever does that make it harder to empathize la yeah okay so if you think about this embodied
people like us the same part of our brain reacting is when we react ourselves as people become more and more different differences in age or ethnicity or gender or sickness or whatever does that make it harder to empathize la yeah okay so if you think about this embodied cognition
