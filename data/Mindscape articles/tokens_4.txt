to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today 
to dive once again into the waters of psychology our guest is olga khazan written a new book called 
the power of being an outsider in an insider world in other words talking about what it means to 
weird and not defining the word weird to mean some weird thing what we really mean in everyday life 
we just say someone is weird normal this one over here is a little bit so what do we 
by that what are the conditions under which we would classify someone as weird why do we do that 
sociology problem not just a psychology question here why do societies choose to label certain people as weird and 
people to be normal the word normal reflects on the fact that obeying norms every society comes up with 
invents rules that supposed to follow and if you follow those rules or not just rules but expectations then 
are labeled weird sc now questions for the person who is being weird also there are different ways to 
weird sometimes it has nothing to do with things you can control like a foreigner in a strange country 
it might be your personality or your choice of hobbies or work or whatever very clear ways backed up 
psychological studies that show you how society punishes you for being weird how it ostracizes you tries to slow 
down but as olga argues also benefits to being weird a certain kind of creativity a kind of new 
on the world that you can get from standing a little bit outside the norms so this is a 
fun and insightful conversation that probably everyone can relate to because not that people are weird the different parts 
every individual person may have some weirdness attached to them sc remember we have a patreon that you can 
mindscape with patreoncomseanmcarroll and remember also doing a video series called the biggest ideas in the universe we tackle 
lot of just very informally ideas from physics and math and philosophy and so forth that help us understand 
universe that we are in a real video not just the talkytalky stuff we do here on mindscape which 
audioonly you can actually see me writing on a little pad and you can see the little diagrams that 
draw and you can think that guy is not very good at drawing diagrams but the ideas are kind 
so with that go music sc olga khazan welcome to the mindscape podcast olga khazan absolutely thanks so much 
having me on sc so written a book about weirdness being weird what it means what you can do 
it and as someone written books myself i know that this is just asking for trouble because unlike the 
boson or quantum gravity weirdness is something where everyone in the world is going to have a preexisting opinion 
what induced you to take on this crazy task ok yeah yeah so i agree that it could be 
and nothing so what prompted this is that i had an unusual upbringing i grew up as an immigrant 
russian immigrant in west texas and though not currently i live in dc and a ton of foreigners and 
here i that experience stayed with me and i became obsessed with this idea of difference and what it 
to be different and yeah i just sort of really wanted to dig into the science behind conformity nonconformity 
we dislike outsiders and what like to be just completely different from everyone else around you and how that 
your psyche so i started reaching out to people who kind of personified that feeling sc yeah obviously sort 
many different dimensions along which one could qualify as weird probably everyone thinks that a little bit weird compared 
other people so do you have a special angle on what you mean by weird how do you define 
ok yeah totally so the way that i defined weird for the purposes of this book is someone who 
different from everyone else around them in whatever context in so for the most part this was looking for 
reaching out to people who were say a male in an overwhelmingly female profession or a female in an 
male profession or a liberal in an extremely conservative environment or vice versa and basically reaching out to them 
being like it like to be and yeah so not necessarily people who walking down the street be like 
people who are by the definition of what doing or where living are different from other people sc how 
is it if one person is weird because the only male in a womendominated job for example if the 
person were in a male job then suddenly they be weird so weirdness is sort of a relationship question 
a person and their environment is that fair to say ok yes totally yeah so not going to yeah 
takes other people so my favorite example of this is so being olga in west texas made me super 
my name in particular but olga is actually a really really common russian name so i went to russia 
a few years ago and i was sitting on a train and just randomly sitting next to me on 
train was another woman with my same exact first and middle name in russia you use your first and 
name so because just super duper common i have a very common russian name and i know it was 
so disorienting because i had always been used to explaining my name and where from and what doing here 
all that stuff and i was just very like yeah just another olga here i so yeah so what 
mean by weird is like obviously being an olga in russia was not weird sc but not only a 
between yourself and what the rest of the world expects also different things we can emphasize your name is 
of important your gender your political or religious views in different contexts whereas maybe i know hair color or 
are less completely dramatic unless super weird in hair color or height so it comes into not just how 
but what the rest of the world cares about right ok yeah totally yeah totally up to how other 
perceive you and funny that you mentioned height so yeah hair color you could dye your hair but if 
think about height so one of the first people that is introduced in the book is a guy who 
of short stature he has dwarfism sc as soon as i said that i realized that was a bad 
because that was one of the things you talk about a lot in the book actually sorry about that 
no no okay but and you would think like not a big deal whatever we have actors with dwarfism 
dinklage and so but he actually had a really really rough time breaking into medicine because of that there 
a time when you just could not become a doctor if you tall so i mean that just gives 
a sense of like yeah this stuff definitely still matters sc well and the world we take the world 
granted in various ways the world of human interaction and employment and so forth but the world is made 
nonweird people if a doctor that is too short to reach the operating table nothing about the height of 
operating table that is set by the laws of nature but it makes your life hard ok yeah totally 
that story in particular was so strange to me because the stuff that was told to this guy michael 
it was like people it was all it so he stands on a step stool to reach the operating 
not like an incredible accommodation that he needs he just stands on a stool but the thing that people 
always like the people rejecting him from medical school were always telling him was like want doctors in long 
coats they want authoritativelooking doctors who they can trust and a short man is just not and like so 
that not even that they were worried that he hold the scalpel or whatever they were just worried that 
or that patients take him seriously because he like what you imagined a doctor in your mind to be 
sc yeah i always in these interviews try to play the advocate a little bit even when on the 
side so i agree with this at all but there an argument to be made for that perspective i 
part of the job is to be a reassuring authority figure is being tall and dignifiedlooking arguably part of 
job is your weirdness truly a hindrance there ok yeah so you see that argument a lot in workplaces 
we go on a job interview what are people looking for is a cultural fit and that basically means 
who talks the way everyone who already works at the company talks and acts the way everyone who already 
at the company acts and it often excludes people who are either neuroatypical or who are just atypical or 
already have that inside speak hookup that the company is looking for so yeah of course this is the 
problem of the book is that we like people to be normal we like normalcy humans are a normal 
we form tribes we like other people who look like us act like us we like rulefollowers and when 
follow the rules unnerving and disconcerting to us and so writing about what like for those people who break 
rules and why we should maybe rethink the fact that we like everything to be normal sc but also 
that things are complicated right another lesson of your book is that the whole thing is very complicated and 
we look at stories in novels or movies or whatever the weird little underdog that rooting for right not 
perfect fitin person that rooting for i think that we all probably like to think that we are proweird 
maybe we exaggerate the extent to which operationally actually the case ok yeah i think right i think that 
right i think most people would say course open to whatever i need normalcy in my but then if 
think about your real your revealed preferences are for normalcy right i know i think correct that we all 
to think that we root for the underdog but that we actually and i think a big part of 
underdog stories is the way that the story is told is that it puts the underdog at the center 
makes them the protagonist and tries to establish a bunch of commonalities between the underdog and the viewer but 
you look at something like anna karenina she was an underdog who killed herself she fit in so not 
underdog story that has a happy ending chuckle sc that is true okay maybe we can one of the 
you do in the book is you do go into the details of some of the psychology studies that 
been done about these issues and so forth and one of the things that hit home very powerfully is 
much the idea of weirdness is set by social norm so not just that the weird person in the 
world but the outside world is a community of people working together to invent these ideas of what counts 
normal and what counts as weird maybe you want to say something about that or we can skip right 
the example of clothes and bathing suits and nudity and so forth ok oh yeah yeah yeah well yeah 
so i can talk more broadly about this and then i can end on bathing suits sc yeah ok 
so yeah so what we think of as normal is determined by this concept in sociology called tightness and 
and basically if you think i know how many people have seen that new netflix show unorthodox about the 
jews a very tight culture it has a ton of rules a rule for how you dress there is 
rule for how you behave rules for how you get married rules for how you dance at the wedding 
is very tightly determined by rules and those societies have established those rules very worried about extinction very concerned 
perpetuating their society everyone has to work together in this very tight way in order to keep it going 
now on the opposite end you have burning man right you have a totally loose society it has no 
everyone bring whatever art project you want you can do drugs you can be naked you can like whatever 
around on a fourwheeler completely anything goes these are very loose societies that usually these societies you see them 
obsessed with perpetuating themselves so like burning man is literally timedelimited at a certain point they just go home 
yeah ok but also if you look at a real example the unitarian universalists are a really good example 
this they their adherence rate is basically stagnant not really grown at all in over the course of more 
a century and part of that is that not a very rulebased religion my a unitarian universalist and you 
have to do anything in that religion you have to go to church you have to like pray to 
no set thing that you really do and so people just do it and kind of like petered out 
so the part of the book where i write about bathing suits is just like an illustration of how 
the norms of society can be where if you go to the pool the pool of my apartment building 
two feet from the street where people are wearing clothes that cover their butts sc yep ok but everyone 
my pool of my apartment that is two feet away is showing off their ass and their cleavage and 
completely letting it all hang out because decided appropriate near water sc near water yeah ok i know so 
just thought it was a very interesting example of we have a ton of rules in our society that 
follow even if we realize it sc and you mentioned that bikinis typically cover any more than underwear does 
be very embarrassed to be seen in our underwear and yet the bikini we actually intentionally go out there 
right yeah that was maybe i know i maybe got a little too high on my own supply in 
section i was so fascinated by the norms of swimming but yeah if you think about anything to do 
bathing or nudity or anything like that that is a that whole space is just filled with norms sc 
i think actually a great example because not only is it filled with norms but the most arbitrary right 
right sc what you can wear any slight deviation from the uniform of whatever place in really really gets 
and sure in all sorts of ways gets enforced ok yeah totally well and another good example of this 
yeah so most bathing suits for women or at least for most of my childhood and teenage years were 
pieces that was the most common you wore a little bikini bottom and a little top but for a 
i went to a evangelical youth group at a church and they were going to take us to a 
park but their rule was that you had to wear a onepiece so that it would cover your belly 
and i know it was such an interesting example of like okay with all of this you can show 
of this skin but the belly button like please for sake cover it too you know what i mean 
sort of get where coming from but also i know to me that was such an interesting reminder of 
many how we try to create this create these rules on the fly and sometimes really strange chuckle sc 
female belly button at least the male belly button apparently has no sexual connotations i guess ok right yeah 
but the female one yeah god forbid chuckle sc but this was also i know if you know but 
tv show i dream of jeannie had a rule that they were never allowed to show barbara navel that 
a no no elaborate costuming went to do that ok right but the rest of her outfit is kind 
sexy right sc oh yeah ok i think the navel would i actually know that but i feel like 
navel would have been that memorable sc no the whole point was though she was supposed to be kind 
sexy but that was judged to be too far but we should mention a little bit more about the 
and loose distinction because i actually had michele gelfand on as a previous guest on the podcast ok oh 
sc so the most devoted listeners know all about tight and loose societies and not that one is good 
one is bad right this is part of point not that you should be tight or you should be 
benefits and disadvantages to either and in either just different standards about the extent to which better be following 
norms ok yeah totally and so glad you brought that up yeah so i should say tightness and looseness 
totally thing she wrote a whole book about that and if interested in that you should check it out 
i just borrowed her brain for this part of the book but yeah so when it comes to tightness 
looseness there are advantages to living in a tight culture how nice to know exactly what supposed to do 
day and to never have to question whether on the right track or whether doing the right thing ok 
going back to the hasidic example if a hasidic jewish woman of my age i would probably be a 
mom i would have six or seven kids i would kind of do the same thing every day i 
cook for my husband i would follow all these certain procedures and frankly some days when i wake up 
like i know if i should email my agent or pitch a story or do a bunch of interviews 
have a lot of existential angst my life is very free form i have any expectations on me basically 
it has costs and benefits i want to be a hasidic jewish woman but i also acknowledge that a 
to living a life where literally no rule book or template for you to follow sc well i think 
right and probably tending towards loose myself in my preference for where i would want to live but i 
do want to stand up for the positive aspect of a tight society look we have modern society humanity 
invented a whole lot of problems that use to exist about anxiety about the world and how to find 
job and things like that and a lot of it is associated with the looseness of our society and 
idea of being in a tight group of people whether small or large where you know exactly what the 
are can make your life a lot easier in a lot of ways ok yeah i think such a 
point i do think that a lot of the angst that i hear and i used to i know 
occasionally mentor younger journalists coming up in the world and i just hear this refrain of know what to 
i know how to get started i know what i should be focusing and not like they they literally 
me to tell them almost like they do want me to tell them what to do there are so 
ways to make a good life for yourself now these days and awesome like who want that there are 
many paths available but almost like this paralysis of choice of like which one should i do which one 
make me happiest which one is the and i think that can be really disorienting sc i remember the 
time i shopped for a condo and i had a wonderful wonderful real estate agent who showed me all 
places and he was very good at picking out the good aspects of a certain place and noticing the 
pitfalls and then i would say what do you think should i get it and like not going to 
any guidance about and it was so frustrating i wanted to be told i had never done this before 
huge choice ok i know yeah yeah starting to think about house buying and going to be a whole 
paralysis of choice sc well and so before i forget i do want to have one silly sounding question 
mentioned burning man as a loose society paradigmatically loose you can be naked and do drugs and do art 
everyone at burning mano naked and doing drugs and doing art if i walked around burning man in a 
suit people look at me like i was weird ok right right right if you really want to do 
crazy art project at burning man do you just wear a tshirt and jeans and like sc yeah ok 
i mean oh that reminds me of do you remember normcore that style of dress sc oh yeah like 
think that i was before that even became popular that i was really perfecting that ok i think so 
because people are like the craziest thing i could wear i know a sweatshirt and jeans and and like 
full circle crazy is normal anyway but a good example of what saying and a few sociologists told me 
as people in especially loose cultures look for more and more original things to do or more weird or 
ideas you kind of converge on the same thing so you see this with the apple revolution where first 
was all about breaking free and not being and being an innovator and now like who have a freaking 
which is great great macbooks but not being different by using a sc no right ok just like everyone 
chuckle sc and you dived briefly into the physiology of this you talk about how there is a gene 
helps control your dopamine receptors and not that it makes if i understood what saying correctly not that it 
you act one way or the other but it just affects how much you follow whatever the norms are 
the society around you is telling you to do ok yeah i still think that most of this most 
what determines whether a normbreaker or not is going to be based on how raised and your own personal 
of biology in your childhood home and also where you grow up but there is sort of this early 
that suggests that how much we uphold norms is related to the variation we have on one gene called 
dopamine receptor gene and it basically just influences how much we endorse the values of our culture ok so 
americans who carried this gene might become more individualistic and sort of pull yourself up by your own boot 
kind of traditionally american norm but a asian who carried a variation of this gene might become more interdependent 
is a more like asian value of more communitarian so it necessarily make you one way or the other 
just kind of makes you uphold whatever the values are of your environment more but just one obviously one 
there are so many not like if you have this gene destined to be a rule follower sc no 
we want to be too reductive about the genes definitely a bad thing but it does point to the 
that weirdness even though the fact that weird is subjective in the sense that it is a relationship between 
and the culture around you whether or not you become weird might have something to do with your genetics 
ok yeah totally and also some research that people with autism or borderline personality disorder actually have a hard 
of interacting normally with society because they have trouble reading a social situation and fitting themselves into the norms 
that environment so there are all sorts of other mental health conditions and personality traits and things like that 
can interact with this and influence how willing to be weird you are sc yeah and it is a 
thing that so just being very obvious so let me try to be a little bit more substantive the 
and where they come from either through nature or nurture and then the society and how it treats weirdness 
there are reasons from evolution and from biology why a society would want its members to be more or 
rule following another podcast i did was with nicholas christakis who talked about mild ingroup bias as one of 
important socialization factors that makes a society work ok yeah totally so this is an area of debate i 
say but yeah so there is this idea that some anthropologists have that in our ancestral past we did 
this ingroup bias that we had kind of networks of alliances and we we liked people who were more 
us than people who were different from us and so i used this example of the too complicated to 
into here but essentially that we sort of had this little clan that we stuck to and we liked 
to act the same way in this clan and sort of how we survive and thrive ok other anthropologists 
not so sure about that so by studying modernday huntergatherers they found that our alliances are often a little 
more looseygoosey than that when off in our natural state that we would travel around and trade with people 
live hundreds of miles away you might live with one clan for a while and then switch over to 
clan all these interesting reports from the century of aborigines in australia who would find a beach whale and 
have a big party for all the other aborigines and be like share our whale and have sex with 
like have a chuckle sc we could have a party back there ok yeah have a big party so 
seem like very stringent or obsessed with our own group or with other people who act like us so 
is like like a little bit unclear what i will say though is that a general agreement that when 
became more xenophobic is right around when farming developed farming settled everyone down there as many whale parties there 
more like plowing and tending fields and being more judicious about your resources and what was yours and what 
someone and you start have the development of social hierarchies some people had more some people had less the 
changed you started to get money and religion and things like that so actually interesting that warfare has increased 
that all started happening so we think of farming and the development of civilization as being a good thing 
actually we really fight that many wars until we started having property to fight over sc did you ever 
that this is what you would be talking about if you imagined yourself ten years ago be thinking about 
origin of farming and what it meant for people getting along with each other chuckle ok yeah yeah i 
i thought it was important in this book to go back and look at at the origins of why 
dislike weirdos since that was one of the questions that i was trying to answer sc yeah ok i 
to explore that sc and a pretty traumatic idea that exploring here that because we tend to think that 
way that we act in the world and sort of socially get along right now is more or less 
law of nature it have been any other way but suggesting that even the simple fact that we have 
affinities for people in our group and tend to react negatively to people outside our group necessarily always like 
it could have been different and there was some transition that was technologically driven years ago that might have 
it all off ok yeah the premise that a lot of these anthropologists have is that essentially when we 
protecting our own land and our own property that is when we started being really wary of other people 
and taking our stuff if you look back at the beached whale example not going to have so many 
flock to your beached whale that it becomes impossible to feed them all and you have to drive some 
them away going to be plenty of resources to go around sc yeah ok and you see that today 
where in a lot of places especially in part of the book i write about the rustbelt towns who 
a lot of immigrants and i think that you see some of that scarcity mindset in some of those 
where the people there felt like the jobs are drying up the kind of the composition of the town 
changing seeing a lot more people from spanishspeaking countries and made really uncomfortable by that if there was plenty 
go around for everyone and everything was a freeflowing neverending supply of whatever everyone wanted be it jobs or 
or positive good vibes about the future i feel like people would be a lot more open to those 
sc well and it feeds back into the tightness versus looseness distinction right when things are going tough when 
are scarce societies tend to tighten up ok yeah exactly yeah so one are the findings from michele gelfand 
that when the kinds of emotions that bring forward a leader like trump or any of these sort of 
kind of leaders are feelings like not going to have enough for my own kind i need everything to 
super conformist and super homogenous for a while because i am really concerned about the future and worried about 
own kind getting enough stuff sc yeah okay so if we take this a bunch of ideas here about 
the idea of weirdness is where it comes from why it exists the other major feature of your book 
sort of talking about what is it good for and bad for right there are both positive and negative 
of being weird i was fascinated by the study that you mentioned which apparently is famous though never heard 
it but the psychology department that decided to ostracize one of their members randomly from week to week even 
they knew it was happening chuckle ok yes no i yeah i know if that famous i just came 
it in my research and thought it was a really poignant example sc makes me feel better ok but 
is the study so we think about like so one thing i often hear is like who cares about 
after high school no one really cares about who gets invited to the prom or not and who is 
out but it actually still plays a really big part in our adult lives i think people just really 
about it that much these professors decided to each ostracize one in their group on a given day so 
would pick a day and be like this is your day for being ostracized and so they were all 
on it so you would think that they be that upset by the ostracism so they would decide not 
talk to that professor that day or just to totally ignore them but even though they knew that it 
happening even though they were all in on it they actually still were really distressed by what was happening 
they wrote that they felt like a ghost on the floor they were really desperate for human interaction and 
just speaks to how troubling ostracism can be for us even if we know that happening and even if 
are aware that just part of an experiment so think about how distressing it would be if you know 
it was happening and it part of an experiment chuckle sc maybe this is worth digging into a little 
more i think probably that psychology study is an especially vivid example but probably most people are on board 
the idea that being ostracized makes you feel bad how close is the connection with being weird and being 
sort of different levels of weirdness i suppose ok yeah totally so not everyone is going obviously some types 
difference in our society are more pronounced and more looks down upon than others so you think about the 
of prejudice and obviously that was a lot more extreme than what the female nascar driver that i followed 
experiencing which is just like some low level of sexism occasionally so differences and degrees so not trying to 
everyone different experiences it the exact same way but you do find that the whole reason why people feel 
or looked down on or discriminated against is because these humans are a group that really values normalcy and 
and rulefollowing and when people break those perceived rules really troubling and we find it really distressing and we 
to kind of push away those people who violate our rules sc there is sort there are layers i 
of weirdness i was trying to think in my mind being a transgender person is one kind of way 
could be weird which would lead to certain reactions from other people being really into roleplaying games or something 
that a different way of being weird or just being super introverted as being weird is are there studies 
commonalities in the way that these groups get ostracized and how they cope with them or is it just 
should think of it as a casebycase basis ok yeah so definitely studies the studies tend to be of 
groups of people so trying to think in my book it like there are studies of gay and lesbian 
bisexual people for example so a study finding that gay lesbian and bisexual people who experience homophobic language get 
headaches and chronic diseases and they are in worse overall health and there are studies of transpeople and how 
lack of access to to a genderaffirming bathroom affects mental health so the studies that tend to be done 
not like take everyone different and study ok they tend to be on sub groups of people but what 
about when i talk about these broader emotions of feeling pain or ostracism talking about clinical studies where they 
in people regardless of who they are and ostracize some of them and make them feel bad and then 
looking at like were you a female engineer before you came into the you know what i mean they 
trying to find people who are different to start with sc so the studies artificially ostracize people and then 
what the effects are ok yeah and sometimes the effects are good so one of the studies that i 
about in the book is one where they ostracize someone in the group and they found that it actually 
them to be more creative and to really boost their creativity but again that was an artificial form of 
the people who ran that study brought in the volunteers and then they were like four are not picked 
work with the group you go and that actually caused them to be more creative but it like they 
the four trans people they just ostracized four random people if that makes sense so you can artificially create 
situation but if you think about it the feeling that a lot of people who are visibly different in 
way or noticeably different in some way deal with every day sc well right it brings up the question 
what are the coping strategies you have a wonderful discussion in your book about a coping strategy which is 
sort of find your own people to find people with whom not weird but a different coping strategy which 
to sort of flaunt your weirdness in a different way ok yeah so different ways to approach this and 
all of them are going to work for every single person so getting support is the most obvious way 
a way that a lot of people dealt with it is they basically got a group to rally around 
whether it was their family or friends but some other people would just get really comfortable being uncomfortable so 
woman that i interviewed asma this muslim woman who grew up in a small southern town she would sort 
just be really proud to be different even though she was different from all the evangelical christians she grew 
around she had this motto that was like i am is a good so if she drinking or if 
participating in christmas parades or whatever else she was still confident in how different she was which i thought 
kind of cool it definitely takes a lot of gusto to be that way sc well yeah i was 
to say just like easy to understand that groups tend to look warily at outsiders i think that our 
reaction is that hard being thought of as weird all the time at being different at the very least 
sounds exhausting kind of psychically ok yeah and really i did a reddit iama yesterday and really what came 
is that a lot of folks actually i did not so the book is not out yet so that 
have not read it but a lot of people a lot of trans people did write in and say 
different at work worried about my career how my career will be affected by being trans do you have 
advice for trans so i do think that even though grown more accepting as a society thankfully a lot 
folks still have to deal with the distress of like will my difference my visible difference affect me how 
people see me differently once they realize that not exactly like sc yeah and i presume that different personality 
that deal better with this automatically but the example you mentioned of the woman who enjoys being weird in 
situations probably again we all feel that way a little bit we want to be exactly cookie cutter like 
else but it is just a path of lesser resistance to fit in with the wider group ok right 
yeah i think there was one thing i mentioned in my book is this optimal level of weirdness so 
people like to be not with the incrowd but also not so different that bizarre so if you think 
indie music a really good example of this indie music is not that indie like i think the most 
genre of music but people really like it because it feels indie or it feels like not part of 
mainstream rock which has completely got away and not part of experimental electronica that is totally nonmelodic and the 
with like i think the largest group of voters are independents which is another good example of this where 
are like not part of this group or that group part of this other group that is itself a 
most of us like to be somewhere in the middle there between totally weird and totally in with a 
sc i mean i guess true i was thinking about how exhausting and tiring it must be to not 
in but at the same time people really do like to feel that not just following the group i 
a podcast with ezra klein on political polarization and he brings up the interesting fact that like you say 
huge number of americans on a survey will say they are independents they do not belong to any political 
but when you ask how they actually vote they are not swing voters only a tiny fraction of these 
that do not reliably vote either republican or democrat they just be like being members of that independent group 
oh totally yeah so intoxicating to feel like special snowflakes and different in some way even though we all 
of end up doing the same thing sc so what do you think is there advice to be given 
what are good coping strategies if you find yourself in a slightly weird group should you move to a 
where there are more people like you or does the ability of online communities help people find likeminded folks 
hang around with and assure themselves that not completely crazy ok yeah so i do talk about some people 
moved from california to mckinney so that they could be around likeminded conservatives mckinney texas sorry and i thought 
was a really interesting and extreme example of if you really get sick of being an oddball you can 
just go join your tribe wherever they are but for the most part one strategy that i really liked 
i thought was kind of a lowstakes kind of way to try this out is called idiosyncrasy credits and 
idea that you can introduce weird ideas and strange kind of thoughts and concepts you just have to kind 
establish your normalcy first you have to kind of prove that you can fit in first ok so the 
to do this is like say you start at a new job and you really want to introduce a 
idea for an event right and the firm is really buttoned up and you think that buy it so 
way to do it is just to like kind of go to your first i know meetings and be 
on board with everything totally a yes man conform as best you can with the lowstakes stuff and then 
your big kind of ask the one that really matters where you can break out your nonconformity and be 
out your weird idea and make your big unusual ask and people will already feel like well so part 
the group so in line with what we already want and one of us so why we consider this 
because being put forward by someone who we consider one of us and like a great cultural fit as 
say in the workplace so one way if you really have just one big thing that you want to 
across is just to play the part a little bit beforehand sc yeah i really like this actually because 
much as words like conformity and the establishment and so forth have a negative connotation norms do serve a 
there are reasons why societies and social groups act in certain ways conventionally and not in others and weirdness 
nonconformity is also important but this sort of mixed strategy as a poker player would call it of showing 
you know what the rules are and understand them and respect them but also occasionally want to break them 
like a healthy way of going through the situation ok right and i think this actually reminds me of 
my friend derek thompson wrote a book as well and one of his big findings was like people like 
that are sort of the same as everything else except slightly different chuckle so like a similar principle here 
you want to be hitting of what everyone else is doing but you want that to be like your 
flare that you bring to a situation so that might be a good way to think about it especially 
places that really where it really matters like work sc yeah sure that a physics way of thinking about 
in terms of power laws and occasional deviations from standard expectations but we try to do that right now 
so the job of the weird people for their own good to survive and flourish and get through life 
guess we go into the online possibilities like are you a fan of not just moving from one place 
another but finding your likeminded spiritual brethren online ok yeah i really do that i spend a lot of 
online with other people i know why that is i just really prefer if going to hang out with 
i prefer to do it in person but i think a lot of people really do get a lot 
solace from that and really enjoy online communities and online gaming and things like that i just personally speak 
that because i do it but obviously a huge community at that point though i would question like like 
you really feel different because you obviously are then part of a big community and some people that community 
bigger for them than going on in their real life so i would say great a great way of 
building but i would say that person probably is not struggling with some of the situations that bringing up 
my book sc yeah okay so then the flip side of this is this is the individual a little 
weird learning coping strategies either finding likeminded souls or deploying their weirdness at strategic moments the other side is 
community making use of weirdness like you already mentioned creativity as something that might come out of being a 
bit weird maybe say more about how those two things are related ok yeah a pretty vast body of 
research showing that as you add dissenting voices to a group they actually the group makes better decisions there 
a famous solomon asch study or variations on the solomon asch study that showed this that essentially in order 
make a good decision you need people who all agree perfectly because if all agreeing perfectly too pointed in 
direction where you have this inescapable momentum and how you get things like enron or whatever the other famous 
of groupthink are where you have people who are just getting carried away with drinking their own koolaid but 
you need those dissenting voices to kind of like you need the cooling saucer of chuckle the weirdo there 
get everyone to consider other possibilities because otherwise just way too groupthinky ok and so yeah so societally this 
like a huge call for including diverse voices and diverse viewpoints in anything where a broad consensus being formed 
the media but also other situations like policymaking or business decisionmaking hugely important to have diverse perspectives in that 
just because you want people to kind of be that kind of crucible of friction with you so that 
can make the best decision possible sc well certainly applicable to academia i know where in an area like 
physics sometimes not a lot of data that you can rely on and just a bunch of people and 
ideas and everyone probably would agree that good to have some outside the box ideas in the mix but 
when an actual department trying to hire somebody are you going to hire the one outside the box person 
is maybe going to revolutionize everything but probably not going to to do anything at all or you going 
hire a person working in the mainstream and likely to give some solid contributions and the answer is almost 
going to go for the person likely to give some solid contributions just too much of a risk to 
out there and we end up being a little bit stodgier than we should be because of that ok 
i think yeah i have heard that not an academic but heard that complaint about academia before you also 
to speak from my own wheelhouse in the media a lot of these when people do say that the 
is too alarmist or that some big press thing that the press blows out of proportion a lot of 
happens because people are taking a cue from each other and no taking a second to be like a 
how much do we really know here and are there other possibilities we could be thinking because people want 
be considered weird right ok so a good example of this is crack babies the media in the did 
bunch of reporting about the future crack babies of america and how basically going to be mentally challenged and 
going to be able to keep up with society and completely doomed these babies to be crack adults for 
and not saying that crack is fine chuckle but saying that that actually happen those like the level of 
disability was much much lower than was predicted and the idea that this whole generation of especially inner city 
was somehow doomed to be like vegetables was totally wrong and i think that because it bounced from the 
york times time magazine to news linked to this and that and people just take time to put the 
on it and that you see that happen a lot sc yeah yeah and maybe a little bit of 
dissenting interesting because it appears in many different contexts talking about the psychology and the sociology of being a 
person in a group but then just the political science of having dissenting voices in the free market of 
and stuff like that and it goes to the same place are there benefits to being weird besides creativity 
we give the sales pitch for why you should be proud of your weirdness a little bit ok yeah 
the other big advantage that i really zero in on in the book is this tendency to really know 
stick to your core principles really really truthfully to be really sure of what you want in life and 
doing and be more confident than most people are in that way and i know that sounds a little 
but to give you an idea some of the people that i was most impressed by were the people 
were online dating back when that was considered really strange and a good way to get axe murdered chuckle 
the way they talked about it or they were like matter what people said i just loved this person 
thought what we were doing was cool i was comfortable with it i was happy to be this kind 
weirdo who was reading over my emails back before there was ok it so and and still married those 
and they have this wonderful origin story that is so unique and so cute and of course not everything 
do is going to be like that but i just thought it was a good example of how if 
really believe in something even if everyone thinks weird it often helps you find your moral compass and stick 
it if really committed to that decision sc i think that makes sense and a really good point as 
wrap up here because exactly because so much social pressure on you when you are deviating from the norm 
you sort of sit back and think should i be like this anyway despite the fact that social pressure 
really does in principle i think it could help you figure out so important and maybe not so important 
yeah exactly yeah it helps you kinda separate the wheat from the chaff of you are your own inner 
sc and it goes back to what you said about the idiosyncrasy credits that you have if you maybe 
to be weird in a hundred different dimensions but maybe worth sitting down and thinking about where is it 
it what should i just go along with the flow because just not worth the struggle and what are 
others where really going to fight for my difference here sc yeah totally yeah this is why i recommend 
just dress really boringly at the office you want to save your chips for the fights with your boss 
more important stuff chuckle sc on your side there so the last thing i just wanted to ask you 
the book with your own experience of weirdness you grew up an immigrant in a conservative texas town and 
forth has this study that done of all these different ways of being weird and so forth has this 
how you think about your own variety of weirdness which was kind of mostly external it was things you 
born into not things you chose ok yeah totally yeah i so i started to rethink i started to 
whether i was really that different from people in my hometown like that maybe this feeling that had my 
life is was more internal than more at least internally perpetuated than externally perpetuated i started to rethink whether 
were whether my parents and i were really as harshly looked down upon and judged as i feared that 
were yeah kind of the main thing that i started to rethink yeah this is my own my own 
i guess chuckle sc no actually i think a fascinating thing that i even think to talk about we 
taking weirdness for granted as a thing but not only is it subjective what counts as weird but a 
bit of judgment goes into thinking whether or not we actually are weird or maybe we perceive ourselves as 
weird or not weird in a way very different from what the society in is judging us to be 
yeah totally your selfperception is a huge part of things and as i have a lot of social anxiety 
i think causes me to maybe overstate the negatives when it comes to how different i am from people 
so i tried to correct for that toward the end of the book chuckle sc yeah well i think 
i recommend the book absolutely to listeners out here a good way of trying to tune ourselves to be 
the right amount of weird which is a good goal but a tough thing to achieve ok yes yeah 
okay olga khazan thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast ok absolutely thanks so much for having 
on it was fun music interesting comparison of traditional and modern societies seems to differ somewhat from in better 
of our pinker provides abundant evidence that relative to population modern societies are less violent than traditional societies like 
australian aborigines khazan describes while there is more largescale violence in modern societies the rate of violence per capita 
significantly lower than in traditional societies where tribal conflict leads to significantly higher deaths per capita not sure if 
holds true for earlier agricultural societies since as pinker notes the longterm trend has generally been decreasing violence pingback
