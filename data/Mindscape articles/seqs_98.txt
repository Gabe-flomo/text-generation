shock and then they learn just to associate the odor with the shock and then they took sperm from the mice and used it in in vitro fertilization and then produced mouse pups and it seems like the mice in the next generation responded oddly to that same odor and so
and then they learn just to associate the odor with the shock and then they took sperm from the mice and used it in in vitro fertilization and then produced mouse pups and it seems like the mice in the next generation responded oddly to that same odor and so the
then they learn just to associate the odor with the shock and then they took sperm from the mice and used it in in vitro fertilization and then produced mouse pups and it seems like the mice in the next generation responded oddly to that same odor and so the claim
they learn just to associate the odor with the shock and then they took sperm from the mice and used it in in vitro fertilization and then produced mouse pups and it seems like the mice in the next generation responded oddly to that same odor and so the claim was
learn just to associate the odor with the shock and then they took sperm from the mice and used it in in vitro fertilization and then produced mouse pups and it seems like the mice in the next generation responded oddly to that same odor and so the claim was that
just to associate the odor with the shock and then they took sperm from the mice and used it in in vitro fertilization and then produced mouse pups and it seems like the mice in the next generation responded oddly to that same odor and so the claim was that somehow
