episode click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean 
before jumping into episode let me just talk about some meta commentary the state of the podcast as we 
know this is a new project for me all learning going on having fun i hope that having fun 
still propagating the podcast out there in different ways i certainly appreciate any efforts that you folks make to 
the word out through twitter or recommending it to your friends itunes reviews make me just as happy as 
other podcaster sc some of you might know that libsyn the host that i use for the actual podcast 
has an automatic thing where they will put the podcast on youtube just a still image not really a 
just the mindscape banner logo there but the audio is the same on youtube as you would get on 
podcast so for those of you listening to it if for whatever reason you would like to watch it 
youtube go ahead no video there there probably never will be any video i know people say video would 
better joe rogan does video joe rogan also makes millions of dollars off of his podcast and so far 
am putting money into it and not getting any out maybe some day i would get some out i 
like to at least pay for the microphones and so forth sc i know what that would eventually mean 
just some kind of patreon page or something like that that would be ideal if it comes to ads 
fine because you can get money and i like money but have to see not gonna be something that 
right away for those of you who are watching on youtube already just so you know also available on 
in the usual ways on itunes stitcher it finally got onto google play google play was having a problem 
libsyn feeds so you need to have your youtube open there you can just click on the links that 
in the description of each video on youtube it will take you to the podcast website where you can 
listen to the audio or download it onto your apps onto your phone whatever you want sc there is 
a subreddit a sean carroll subreddit that you can check out if you wanna discuss further the youtube comments 
been awesome but a more centralized place to go is on reddit where people are talking about these things 
i think all that i wanted to say for the commentary stuff so get into episode the theme of 
is that we know everything as we go through life but we still have to make choices we still 
to act in the world somehow but we live in a situation of incomplete information we know going to 
in the future we also even know everything about the world right now sc so what we do is 
attach probabilities to things we say a certain chance that going to happen a credence is how much weight 
put on one possibility versus another and then we act accordingly formalizing this idea of placing probabilities on things 
then acting accordingly is called betting and nowhere is the idea of betting made more explicit and formalized that 
the game of poker poker is one of my favorite games a game of skill that has luck involved 
you know what the other players have but you can make choices and some of those choices you can 
there are people who make money over the long term very regularly playing poker those are called professional poker 
they really exist no professional slot machine players there just losing money overall sc but poker is a game 
skill and guest liv boeree is a perfect person to talk to about this stuff liv was a physics 
as an undergraduate at the university of manchester and she was quite good at that but she decided instead 
add a little spice of excitement to her life by becoming a professional poker player and done pretty well 
say it was a bad choice made almost four dollars million dollars in winnings at the poker table and 
gonna talk about what you learn from being a poker player what that helps you do in terms of 
everyday life making choices about one thing to do or another in conditions of incomplete information where probabilities are 
liv also still remains interested in science and is developing tv projects to help popularize science she also has 
interested in altruism and charitable giving within the umbrella of effective altruism trying to use empirical data to maximize 
impact as charitable givers the cofounder of an organization called raising for effective giving which funnels money to organizations 
have shown that they really have gotten good bang for their buck in terms of the charitable dollars sc 
gonna talk about poker gonna talk about altruism also gonna talk about how to think about the existence of 
whether or not aliens exist out there in the world turns out to be something at the intersection of 
and also probability how do you reason about something like that when you have so little data so go 
sc liv boeree welcome to the mindscape podcast liv boeree thank you very much sc so now you were 
at least undergraduate educationwise as a astrophysicist lb yes sc now a professional poker player lb correct sc so 
to set the stage i think for a lot of people if you say poker they know exactly what 
means i bet a lot of people in the audience are unclear that there are such a thing as 
poker players is that even legal are you in downstairs is it like rounders are you getting in trouble 
is the situation what is your lifestyle like how does this work being a professional poker player lb so 
depends obviously from person to person there are different types of professional poker players but i for the most 
play a type of poker called tournament poker where everyone puts up an equal amount of money and in 
for that you will get a certain amount of chips and basically everyone keeps playing until everyone else is 
out and one person has all the chips and wins either all the money or certain sort of distribution 
the prize pot sc like capitalism lb exactly yes a very aggressive zerosum form of capitalism so i got 
it in a very random way as you said i studied physics i fully intended to carry on in 
i loved it but at the same time i had been in i was i also had ambitions of 
a rock star i was very into heavy metal and disturbing my neighbors late at night playing guitar and 
i was like know what gonna take the summer off after my graduation and i need to make some 
somehow so gonna apply for tv game i felt like that made sc as a contestant lb as a 
i always liked playing games long story short i learned to play poker on one of these game shows 
i loved the game and i was like know what i think i want to take a few years 
throw myself into this game i think i have an aptitude for it it seems like a lot of 
i want to travel the world and get some life still in the back of my mind saying come 
to sc right once made our pile we can go think about the universe lb yeah make some money 
back my student debt and now ten years later still here sc the debt has long since been repaid 
yeah exactly well things just turned out pretty well in the poker sense and yeah so in terms of 
sort of lifestyle a lot of for me at least travelling to different tournaments so a big stop in 
every august or a big stop in vegas which just come from the world series and you also travel 
to not the pro tour because anyone can play them but the professionals tend like their lifestyle going from 
to event and playing in these tournaments sc so literally anyone listening right now as long as they have 
right amount of money can show up day of the tournament and say i am lb wanna sc not 
a golf tournament or basketball anyone is welcome and a meritocracy once there lb exactly yeah so anyone can 
it mean you necessarily should play but if you want to and you have the money and the desire 
you absolutely can and i mean i think what obviously separates poker a little bit from something like golf 
golf the results of a golfer are very closely correlated to their skill level whereas with poker particularly over 
small sample size of maybe even one hundred tournaments the worst players could be vastly outperforming the best players 
so to say well only gonna let in the people had the best results over the last six stupid 
people would just get very annoyed with it because a first of all everyone thinks the best why poker 
but b it actually be correlated to necessarily being the best players getting in sc the ones who are 
would like the money from the people who are not good to be in the tournament pool right lb 
yeah yeah this constant battle between i be playing against the best gonna say the best but at the 
time i wanna scare people and so yeah you need the weaker players you want to be playing against 
an ideal world sc but it is a game a combination of luck and skill right like everything in 
but not just luck a certain element of randomness dealt the cards but then you play them in a 
way so not like playing blackjack or craps where really no way to win without some kind of cheating 
yeah exactly i mean with those yeah the casino built its big golden halls and amazing rooms and spaces 
they have this small edge that over time they make money from and the longer you play unless you 
how to count cards which again the casinos will kick you out for for doing you make money playing 
and roulette whereas poker because playing against other people and the casino hosts it basically i think casinos really 
host poker not really making great money from it basically just a small percentage of each pot but yeah 
poker playing against other people and so if you are consistently making better decisions than your opponents then you 
going to be making a profit in the long run sc i do get the feeling though that the 
enjoy having poker players around some of them are very good at playing poker but then are perfectly willing 
go blow it at the baccarat table lb a very very correct observation yeah i mean known many many 
players who were some of the best in the world and yet had no money to their name because 
were the worst in the world at walking past the roulette table just another game just walking past it 
the best at walking past sc and they know that they should lose on average lb yeah but they 
love it sc yeah paying lb yeah i think to be a good poker player you have to obviously 
a willingness you cannot be a riskaverse human you have to be willing to gamble to take risks to 
those hotinthethroat moments but at the same time you need to be able to do that in an intelligent 
way certainly not the best players you see around now most of them actually have what we call sort 
the degenerate gambler streak in them as much but there are still some who do struggle with it and 
a tragedy to see someone worked so hard at being so good at one particular game but then have 
sort of we call it a life leak a leak in the bottom of their pocket which is some 
form of gambling but it makes for great stories though sc it does and it also contributes to this 
that the game has of being slightly disreputable right no matter how much money and tv exposure and everything 
you still to this day do as you allude to hear stories of some of the best players just 
like lb right sc but they come back they just lost five dollars million over the it therefore must 
a very different kind of lifestyle than maybe you thought you were signing up for when you went to 
as a astrophysics major lb yeah yeah i mean seen this sort i had some insights i have to 
some insights into the world the top chess players for example and it is for the most part a 
different sort of social dynamic because the best chess players they really have they just study and study and 
and study and i mean brilliant obviously at what they do but i i think poker players have a 
bit more of the the sort of not free spirit but you know what i mean like this wildness 
them sc right lb these urges i guess that they want to fulfill they get thrills from many other 
as well whereas chess players tend they have to be so laserfocused on what they do sorry where am 
sc but just to continue exactly in that line the thing that doing when playing poker is fundamentally different 
the thing that doing when playing chess when playing chess both players see the board lb right sc when 
poker you know what the other cards are and so they put out a big bet they go here 
is this is all your stack this is for your tournament life you have a pretty good hand but 
the metaphysically perfect and you need to ideally say a certain chance that bluffing a certain chance that not 
just gonna risk lb yeah exactly like with chess you have all the information out there there is no 
information i mean sure you directly see into the other brain to see what specific strategies but you usually 
a pretty good idea and not very definite bits of information that you have whereas poker yeah incomplete and 
why you have to think probabilistically and yeah so then it becomes sort of this largely a science of 
able to quantify these uncertainties that you have like well what is the range of hands that they could 
be playing here okay from pocket twos to ace and like that and also what is but then i 
the piece of information that they bet this particular card but not this one and they bet this size 
then on top of that even harder to quantify things like the pulse in their neck seems to be 
really really strongly here when i expect it lb is inconsistent with the story telling with their so what 
i do with that and so all these little bits of variables of information of some of which extremely 
about and others really not and got to sort of evaluate all of these somehow and put them in 
to come out to one answer that is most likely to be the correct decision that you make sc 
know ed witten the physicist lb who sc ed witten the famous string theorist lb heard yes sc yeah 
would probably win the poll if you asked most theoretical physicists in the world today the smartest theoretical physicist 
oh really sc yeah lb okay sc he like poker because he says know what the other person has 
chess i could outthink everybody but in poker you have to make up lb like heuristics basically you have 
heuristics models lb yes sc of the opponent and of course the counter to that would be that john 
neumann helped invent game theory he wanted to become a better poker player literally he was playing poker lb 
the thing surprised ed witten like it so much still ultimately a mathematical game sc it is but also 
so sure one of the classic questions asked is what is the balance lb yes sc doing math versus 
psychology when literally at the table lb so the answer to that is it entirely depends i hate throwing 
out there when it really does wildly depend i would say like and so say for example i wanted 
make you into the very best poker player in the world i would want to sit with you and 
sure that you have put of our effort into making sure that you understand the game theory sc the 
right yeah lb the math the building blocks of the game so that your strategies are built upon that 
a mathematical game then on top of that if i can teach you some of the psychology and the 
to quantify parts these sort of i guess build your intuitions up so that you are able to intuit 
behaviors what thinking but just more really just a matter of experience i think ultimately some people are more 
just better at reading people than others naturally but i still think ultimately a learnable skill and again some 
the best poker players still find ways to almost quantify their uncertainty about these very psychological human characteristics sc 
lb know what the you know i should be calling of the time according to game theory and then 
have a piece of evidence that suggests that actually the bluffing very more rarely than that well how confident 
i in that and then i might waver the needle to say somewhere down to call instead but still 
that you can quantify sc yeah i once went to a movie premiere with a bunch of people and 
of the people was phil laak the poker player famous poker player lb he calls himself the time scientist 
a time scientist i did not know that lb yes sc we talk about that but chitchatting a whole 
of us in the lobby before the movie starts and phil suddenly says an chance that gonna have to 
before the movie ends so i should go to the bathroom right and i know whether or not that 
of silly precision of was a joke or whether just that good at estimating things like that lb knowing 
he is pretty good he does like to think in terms of probabilities but that degree of granularity i 
sc just having fun lb just having fun yeah sc so obviously math in the sense of i need 
heart to come down and i only have one card some elementary math what is the lb yes sc 
a heart will come down right sc but also higher level math in particular the game theory situation with 
of optimal strategies and dominant strategies and exploitative strategies do you study that as part of your education training 
a professional poker player lb yeah ideally you wanna familiarize yourself well lucky in this day and age there 
these solvers out there you can basically will run multicolor simulations in you can go what should i do 
jacknine suited on a one suit board of the same and or similar scenarios like that put them into 
solver let it run for a few hours and it will show you what their game theory optimal strategies 
the range of hands that you conceivably have in that situation would be lb so there would usually be 
a percentage of those hands that you would want to checkraise because really good for example because they have 
lot of equity but a percentage that you would want to checkcall because kind of in the middle of 
road and then a percentage that you would then want to bluff because you need to balance out your 
you just checkraise with the strongest hands you need to have some bluffs in there from so that so 
can get called you need to have the appearance of having a balanced range of hands bluffs and weak 
when you make an aggressive action lb and so anyway you can literally find out what is the as 
close to the perfect game theory optimal solution is now in these different scenarios and so the very best 
will sit and work with these solvers you use them in real time but you can go away and 
study for hours and sort of try to basically build them into a model that emulates these game theory 
solutions and then once you have these this mental model of game theory optimal then you can go out 
and play using the style as a sort of as a base but then you would then deviate from 
as in when you come across an opponent who is playing not in a game theory optimal style because 
good way to think about it is if you and i were to play rockpaperscissors and you know anything 
me what would be the strategy the best strategy that you would employ sc i believe the best strategy 
randomly do one third one third one third in rockpaperscissors lb exactly yeah exactly you wanna perfectly randomize because 
have any information about me so in response to that the best case that i can do is to 
randomize perfectly sc right lb if i do anything on that gonna be be taking advantage of me so 
a nash equilibrium basically sc sorry explain what that is for the people out there in podcast land lb 
a nash equilibrium is basically a state a strategy where unprofitable for either competitor or any competitor it can 
multiple competitors as well like more than two to deviate from that strategy if you deviate from it only 
be losing on average in the long run sc so the equilibrium where everyone is doing as best they 
lb as best they can and breaking even in this situation breaking even against each other like if both 
zerosum game lb exactly yes however if you notice that i start throwing rock every sc yeah lb should 
continue playing sc i could beat you there i could have a better strategy i guess lb exactly you 
stupid to carry on just playing this perfect randomized thing no wanna start playing paper far more often or 
and so that is what call then an exploit you exploit my bad play by deviating from the previous 
theory optimal sc right lb and so that same kind of thing applies in poker be start off maybe 
playing this game theory optimal strategy and if your equally good hopefully try and match that and be in 
long run breaking even against each other but because basically no human in the world can play perfectly game 
optimal there are these you wanna over the course of time observe what these mistakes other people are playing 
so deviate and start exploiting those sc i was highly amused to learn that there were competitive rockpaperscissors leagues 
i know that they exist sc they do because people are not good at randomizing right lb how right 
and in fact this is a very educational moment for me also the new york times had an app 
you could go and play rockpaperscissors against the app and basically it had trained as a ai sort of 
on millions of real life human being rockpaperscissors players and realized what the tendencies were lb wow sc what 
deviations from randomness were and it would beat you and i went in lb we both kind of edge 
it was small it was not large but lb like sub sc over twenty hands you could definitely tell 
you were losing lb really sc yeah that was my experience lb jeez sc but then what i realized 
i went in there cocky like know what the hell this is working gonna beat and it destroyed me 
then i realized there was something that i felt i should be doing like i played rock two times 
a row i should play scissors or something like that right and i would tend to do that and 
was lb you do these same thing in a row many times sc yeah right hard to do you 
how many times those sequences come up randomly lb right yeah sc but what i realized was if i 
out what my impulse was and had the strategy that the new york times app would probably play a 
strategy against my lb natural impulses yeah sc then i should play the one that would beat that and 
i kicked its ass i really did lb wow sc it was just a matter lb over how how 
iterations sc not the most exciting game in the world right so dozens but not hundreds of iterations put 
that way lb awesome i wanna do that sc well we can find that and another thing that along 
lines i remember the first time i learned about in the realm of nash equilibrium and game theory the 
that in games like this mixed strategies will generally be the dominant or the equilibrium optimal strategies in other 
no one action you should ever take every time in that situation and perfectly obvious in rockpaperscissors also true 
poker if you have pocket aces in some position the best possible strategy is not to do the same 
every time no matter what you have almost always true and then so you have to if the strategy 
to do one thing of the time and something else of the time really hard to ever do that 
you know not doing the best thing right lb right what some of the again the top players have 
doing now because everyone knows that you need to be able to basically be a perfect randomizer machine to 
these not only sort of to remember what these ratios you need to have in certain situations where you 
to be bluffing with say of your hands and betting for value with how do you randomize that well 
have started at watches like yours taken it off but with the second hand old analog watches have become 
again why because a really good randomizer if you go okay you just use where the secondhand is on 
clock face okay if between zero and if you know you wanna checkraise of the time is it between 
and oh yes it is okay this is a checkraise situation if not okay i check cool sc do 
do that lb not as much as i should done it a few times but a i always forget 
watch and other players do it by actually just shuffling their chips all the time usually the chip will 
the word written on it and just where it sc interesting lb but yeah a way and even if 
is the thing people think oh you need to then keep this secret that doing this no sc it 
yeah the optimal strategy yeah lb even if your opponent knows they just go shit playing gto against okay 
need just an unsettling thing to know basically sc right yeah but part of me thinks that less important 
actually play the game theoretical optimal strategy than to make your opponent think playing it right because not perfect 
or randomizers either so if supposed to do something two thirds of the time and something else one third 
the time and your randomizer makes you do the one third of the time thing three times in a 
then i would definitely do the other thing no matter what the randomizer told me the next time because 
actually my opponent is not building the correct model of me lb that is true to an extent yes 
at the same time if your opponent is also then playing this perfectly sort of randomize in the right 
style their style will not be losing out to because they are playing this unexploitable style then arguably going 
still be playing less less perfectly than they are and so in the long run again always down in 
long run still be playing less a less profitable style than them or sorry a more exploitable style than 
sc but when it comes to poker at a table with six or ten people we know the game 
optimal style lb no sc poker has not been solved and in fact as far as i know artificial 
cannot win at a ten hand ten player table against a top player lb yeah no been the ai 
successfully beat humans heads up one on one sc one on one yeah lb but i even know if 
to do the three person and higher game because the game tree just gets ridiculous decision tree sc yeah 
yet we poor humans do it lb exactly yeah really really good at building these sort of heuristics i 
why so good at it but able to sort of condense this down into the rules of thumb that 
out really well sc i mean i think it kind of makes sense that is what good at right 
thinking fast and slow daniel kahneman would explain we think in terms of rational logical choices generally we think 
terms of heuristics we think in terms of rules of thumb and really good at coming up with models 
the world that are pretty good right that are not great lb yes good approximations that get us sc 
yeah yeah i mean do you use bayesian analysis or something like that very much why we explain what 
analysis is lb sure bayesian analysis is basically updating our model of the world based upon new information incorporating 
evidence based on the weight the strength of this evidence whether proving or disproving our beliefs and then when 
see that thing happen go okay well this means i should change my mind by this amount like shifts 
needle if you think all trees are green all leaves are green go but then if you go around 
but then if you see a tree with purple leaves well now evidence to suggest not so true so 
now shift towards okay maybe not all trees are green etcetera and a way you can actually model that 
using theorem do i do it mathematically in game absolutely not i have likelihood ratios and so on in 
head sc too much lb but ultimately our brains are bayesian machines right what doing naturally without really realizing 
and at least to me it seems like a sort of fundamental law of not a physical law but 
is a what do you call it a psychological law it is some kinda law of the world we 
in right sc theorem a math theorem the correct way to update your model of the world i lb 
it seems like it sc i think a rational way to behave right lb yeah sc and so my 
is this is my amateur poker way of thinking about it you can tell me whether it makes sense 
sit down at the table and you more or less assume everyone is the same in some way and 
as you see how they play your model of each individual player becomes more sophisticated lb yes sc so 
have ways in poker of sort of describing that there are tight players and loose players and aggressive players 
so forth and maybe then you say oh this person is tight before the flop and then they become 
and is that more or less going through your mind lb yeah i mean not that i would ever 
stereotyping people at all but when you sit down at a poker like i just played the world series 
poker main event for example where generally against a lot of amateur players who pony up their ten thousand 
once a year and the best moment of the year really good laughter sc it was profitable for you 
lb yeah worked out pretty well this time and so when you first sit down i will immediately look 
the table and create literally first impressions of how someone looks literally their gender their age the way sitting 
their chair the clothes wearing the way they look at me their appearance of confidence or not confident and 
immediately create some kind of stereotype sc a prior we call it lb a prior exactly a prior but 
in an ideal world still just try and not let that influence my play too much just a little 
but as soon as you start getting real information after hands well now seen okay this person played a 
hand over thirty hands did i think they were tight beforehand actually yes and does the evidence continue to 
that yes it does okay so i can shift the needle a little bit more to strengthen that belief 
if i notice actually the person who like the old guy who seemed conservative and timid has played every 
hand and is raising and reraising everyone sc better update lb time to update this is very strong evidence 
the needle more towards an aggressive player and so yeah you sort of start building these models of people 
then by the end of the day if been at the same table and now got probably multiple hundreds 
hands where seen a lot of information of tendencies with increasing degrees of nuances so built up a very 
mental model of players over a given period of time sc so do you take this way of thinking 
strategies game theory optimal etcetera theorem and updating your priors do you extend it from poker to the rest 
your life has being a professional poker player changed how you go about buying a house or getting a 
or choosing where to go for dinner lb yeah i would say so in terms of just thinking about 
in terms of probabilities and uncertainties beforehand i was very black and white in my thinking either happen or 
i certainly comfortable with any kind of granularity and now sort of look at something and be like do 
am i gonna make it in time for this podcast judging by the la eh sc the yeah lb 
the gone down and estimate at least mentally and hopefully try and communicate it to people as well what 
think the likelihood is in in terms of a percentage to be there on time that kinda thing and 
terms of picking boyfriends well yeah sc you picked a poker player so what does that tell you lb 
know hard when playing on the poker circuit not to also have a significant other sharing the same lifestyle 
yeah funny story igor and i well igor asked me now about half a year ago randomly he said 
you think the likelihood is that still be together in three years we were like talking about moving cities 
should we buy a house and he said what you think the likelihood is actually be together in three 
time i said sc that sorry a question that would only be asked by number one a poker player 
number two someone who is pretty secure in the relationship already laughter lb yeah well yes a reasonable thing 
assume and luckily our numbers came out fairly similarly i think it was like or or something like that 
excellent lb yeah sc a nonlinearity there like getting the wrong answer could change the probability lb oh absolutely 
there can but at the same time really useful to know even if you end up being honest with 
other the fact that it asks you to reflect on that and you come away and think actually the 
i found myself the word coming out of my well if nothing else information for yourself sc right lb 
like oh something not quite right here fortunately i did genuinely i was like i think definitely over definitely 
a stuff can still happen and luckily we were pretty much aligned yeah so it i found it has 
into my thinking in all sorts of ways and in general you just become more strategic i know i 
a bad thing i know that sometimes when people ask what you and particularly if in some kind of 
like a poker player well i believe anything you and i was like come sc they think poker is 
about massive crazy bluffs not about strategic thinking lb exactly yeah no about choosing when to bluff actually minimizing 
risk when you bluff bluffing is stressful it can be very fun when you get away with it but 
not fun when you get caught sc yeah oh yeah lb and when poker players know what like to 
your bluffs caught be caught in a lie a embarrassing and b it actually just financially hurts and it 
knock your confidence and so on and so away from the table i lying really very fun i get 
scratch that itch at the table and it just creates complications and unless really really really good reason for 
i tend to try and avoid it sc and it is embarrassing even at the poker table but it 
right i mean just playing the game theoretical optimal strategy lb yes yes sc why should i be sad 
having my bluff called lb yeah no definitely a thing i try anyone teaching poker i say the first 
you get caught in a bluff turn those cards over and slam down and have a big have smile 
your face and be proud of yourself sc a very good advice lb because a big part of the 
and you have to get used to that sort of getting your fingers caught in the cookie jar because 
you ever get caught then probably not doing it often enough sc right lb so yeah so many different 
of the game that bleed over into life i mean just the emotional control part of it poker you 
to get used to bad luck very fast because you play hands in a week you wanna have one 
where you should win the hand of the time but you have multiple of those happen and they really 
but probabilities they compound over time and if many many instances of bad luck things that could happen then 
one of those will happen to you and so if you remember that i find you get less emotionally 
and less of a shock sc and i yeah i mean what you said about the granularity of probabilities 
think is very true i had this idea that almost everyone thinks there are only three probabilities for anything 
or right lb yeah sc you know nothing the idea of something being is just really hard for human 
to latch on to and maybe this is those heuristics that we grew up with in the wild in 
veld of africa you better make a decision right away under conditions of stress and you get to do 
over and over again so you would really say that your experience as a poker player has given you 
better ability to correctly handle those situations lb yeah i think so i think i mean familiar with the 
in terms of humans we evolved in tribes of probably up to one hundred fifty or so people and 
beyond that numbers that useful in terms we have to count much beyond that and the classic example of 
one thousand birds dying in dying from an oil spill somewhere feel some degree of sadness about that if 
say a million birds dying from oil you feel a thousand times sadder you feel probably a little bit 
but not a thousand times lb and so we have this like our brains intuitively equipped to think accurately 
really large numbers or really really small numbers we just work on this little macroscopic level in our everyday 
and so i would say in realms of probabilities that sorts us out between the and the but beyond 
things they feel really it happens of the time a a never oh of the time pretty much always 
and i know and i think on the most part we have an intuitive understanding of what actually a 
like or a or a but poker you play enough you like i find my emotions genuinely correlate like 
i turn the cards up on the flop you know we get a big allin and a underdog so 
yeah only a chance to win well just not gonna get excited like lost sc yeah not gonna win 
yeah or if i have a chance of winning then my emotions are even less i just feel anything 
annoyed that i got it in so bad but if a coin flip my heart will genuinely be racing 
i will win this of the time and who knows gonna and so yeah you become well calibrated to 
these these probabilities mean because just seen these situations so many times over does that therefore apply to the 
world i mean yeah like if if someone says i know to make a flight i if i can 
out that roughly to make a flight then i will i would be extremely pleasantly surprised if i did 
it whereas i laughter but at the same time i think that well calibrated as i am in poker 
hard yeah hard so just to change gears a little bit i was pleased to see that you had 
article in vox recently you went back to your astrophysics training and it was a story about the application 
probabilities to interesting questions about the nature of the universe so why you fill us in on what that 
lb yeah so recently some of the researchers at the future of humanity institute in oxford published a paper 
the fermi which i imagine most viewers know what the fermi paradox is sc not imagine that tell them 
it is lb okay fermi paradox is basically enrico fermi back in when was it sc he live into 
he was very radioactive yeah lb bad but yeah basically he looked up like there seem to be billions 
not trillions of stars out there and we know that the universe is somewhere around fourteen billion years old 
so many possible sites for life why are we not at been releasing radio waves now for a few 
relatively easily surely we should be at least hearing or picking up trace signals from other worlds or else 
aliens all the time lb the universe is so old there must be at least a few other thousand 
out there that have got a big head start on us so where is everybody so the famous fermi 
the contradiction between the size and age of the universe and the lack of observed alien life and so 
paradox has seemingly only gotten stronger with time as become more spacefaring and discovered more and more exoplanets and 
seems like the universe is even more capable of hosting life than we imagined sc certainly a lot of 
out there where it could be yeah lb so many places right and yet still seen nothing and been 
looking hard and anyway so this paper that they published uses the drake equation which was sort of this 
that is the best way we could try and estimate the number of intelligent civilizations within the milky way 
a novel form of analysis on it that been really done before and the answers that came out the 
of that is that we are somewhere around to be the only intelligent civilization within the galaxy and somewhere 
a coin flip about to be the only intelligent civilization in the entire observable universe which is pretty pretty 
stuff sc right counterintuitive to many people yes lb extremely counterintuitive agreed also quite disappointing love there to be 
aliens out there i mean at least from a curiosity standpoint but yeah nonetheless pretty groundbreaking claim and so 
article was discussing how they came to that claim or the actual processes that they did the methods of 
lb but then i wanted to make a larger point from that which is okay well we know for 
that this is actually the case but assume that it is based upon our current best state of knowledge 
seems like if nothing else intelligent life is extremely rare in the universe what does that mean philosophically speaking 
us if we really are the only intelligent civilization out there and may well be for the rest of 
future what does that mean should we do anything with that information should we change any of the behaviors 
currently exhibiting and the trajectories that we seem to be putting ourselves on to and i think yes i 
it speaks that we have a greater responsibility to not blow ourselves up sc right i do wanna get 
that but first i wanna dig into this probability stuff because the drake equation is something that has been 
around ad nauseam right people love talking about the drake equation and so for the two of you out 
in podcast land who have not heard about it the drake equation is a way of estimating the number 
intelligent civilizations by saying well how many planets are there times the fraction of planets on which life develops 
the fraction of which the life becomes intelligent etcetera different ways of breaking it down sc but as far 
i can tell two things in the new paper that are kind of interesting one is they take seriously 
idea of rather than finding just our best fit number for the fraction of times life comes into existence 
then becomes multicellular they say the uncertainty or what is the probability so taking those probabilities a bit more 
sc and secondly it is a matter of being good bayesians and updating our priors right i mean not 
just based on the laws of physics probably the only intelligent civilization in the galaxy saying based on the 
that we seen it yet that in some sense fermi was right it would have been very very easy 
run into another civilization if they were out there we seen them they seem to be out there and 
from that we draw the conclusion that probably the simplest explanation is just not there maybe just way more 
that intelligent civilizations exist and continue to exist than we thought it might have been lb right exactly the 
that we found any evidence of aliens is evidence unto itself and should be incorporated into the bayesian model 
we have of the situation sc were they able to pinpoint one of the factors and say this is 
the tiny one lb in terms of which one has sc the smallest probability is it that life usually 
or intelligent life form lb yeah so the one that has the biggest number of range of uncertainty on 
is a fraction of planets that develop life sc okay which makes perfect sense what do we know about 
right lb yes exactly we still really figured out how life started on earth the process of abiogenesis is 
really not well understood yet and so the difficulty that had with the drake equation is that plugging in 
like the rate of stellar genesis within the number of stars that develop per year an astronomical number we 
a reasonably accurate number for lb we have data on that stuff yeah sc exactly we have data for 
but then something like the fraction of planets that develop life it could literally the uncertainties they have two 
orders of magnitude of uncertainty sc oh my goodness okay lb yeah that that much sc yeah lb and 
thing is is that because any number between that is actually completely plausible by saying well yeah but ignore 
fringe parts of making a making a claim of knowledge that we make say well probably somewhere in the 
as the probability distribution is like fattailed all the way down and so to cut these off is just 
bad math basically sc yeah glad the paper came out run into great resistance always felt basically this we 
how likely it is that life is going to exist the other obvious bottleneck is multicellular life which again 
know how that exists i tend to think that once we get multicellular life intelligence is probably not far 
but both the existence of life itself and multicellularity seem very mysterious maybe the chances are just ten to 
minus and people say are so many planets out laughter and there is no number n such that i 
find another number that multiplies it and gives us a small number lb tiny tiny tiny number exactly i 
sort of the idea of this great filter where some kind of insurmountable barrier that exists somewhere in the 
of evolution that for whatever reason most planets get past and for some reason earth managed to get past 
i hate to even hazard a guess at where it is but intuitively not that intuition really apply to 
it feels to me that somewhere in the step from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life somewhere around there but again 
sc right so not just multicellularity but just the idea of having a nucleus in your cells lb exactly 
a nucleus within a sc fair probably more important lb that seems to somewhere around that some other work 
future of humanity institute are doing right now on the similar analysis but looking at the transitionary time the 
it takes to go from each step to each step and it just seems quite likely that the reason 
the the reason why life everywhere is because it just takes such a long time for it to actually 
to the stage where intelligent civilizations then actually spring up we made it on earth of the way through 
lifespan in about seven hundred fifty million years sc life came into being relatively quickly but then it sat 
in this boring monocellular form yeah lb nothing state for ages and ages and then suddenly boof there was 
explosion where evolution kickstarted faster and interesting things started appearing but that basically until of the way through of 
had it just been a little bit longer we would not have existed earth been gobbled up by the 
laughter and so a reasonably plausible explanation as to why life is incredibly rare sc i suspect the right 
my other favorite one is that there are plenty of civilizations they all become highly advanced they upload their 
into computers and then they become bored and they go space traveling anymore lb yes a good one also 
aestivation hypothesis you know that one sc i know that one lb be better to explain the exact reason 
but because computation is expensive in higher temperatures in you would expect a rational civilization would want to maximize 
number of computations it can do over time so it makes sense for them to hibernate or aestivate until 
general temperature of the until far far in the future and the ambient temperature of the universe is much 
and therefore much cheaper i think something like ten to the thirty more computations a second you could achieve 
something like that i remember anders samberg has a very fun paper on it sc never heard of that 
i like the audacity of it i believe it so tell you why i believe it because one the 
of the universe goes down fair but also the free energy of the universe goes down the energy we 
available to run our computation goes down so i presume someone smarter than me has actually done the calculation 
said still better to wait but clearly lb yeah but pretty sure he factors that in but not versed 
to explain why nonetheless again it was one that felt it was very fun laughter but intuitively like sc 
it only takes one plucky counterexample only one civilization has to not buy into that but it does remind 
of john wheeler used to say when he mixed cream into coffee he always felt sad because he was 
the entropy of the universe irretrievably but you do bring up this question of what does it mean what 
so what if we are the only civilization only intelligent lifeforms it makes you think for better or for 
but making you think is good are we here what is the and you actually have been thinking about 
like this right lb yeah i was just having a conversation with my partner igor about moral realism i 
that very much a nonmoral realist in terms sc a happy humean constructivist yes lb yes and of the 
mindset but that said if you want to if nothing else maintain optionality us going extinct is definitely going 
that laughter now the options have disappeared to zero and it definitely appears like there is a very real 
that we can go extinct by even and by real risks the estimate is anywhere between like and sc 
moral constructivist but the morals i can construct do say that human extinction would be bad lb will be 
yeah sc okay i need an objective story to tell myself about lb exactly yeah it just seems like 
would be a terribly big shame if all these little pockets of low entropy have managed to appear us 
going against the second law of thermodynamics to a degree are we actually going against the second law of 
sc no nothing goes against the second law of thermodynamics lb not so how this is what never wrapped 
head around how do pockets of low entropy so successfully exist then sc well actually an outgrowth of the 
law of thermodynamics because if we think about it if it what would it mean to not have the 
law of thermodynamics what would it mean is that we were already in thermal equilibrium we were already at 
maximal entropy state once you say the early universe started with low entropy all you need to say then 
increases and the second law the only way out of that is to say were already in high and 
there would never be any life there would never be any complex structures there would never be anything like 
we are not creating pockets of low entropy we are leeching off of the fact that the early universe 
an extraordinarily low entropy increasing the entropy of the universe willy nilly a separate question related but separate which 
why are we complicated why are there complex structures in the universe sc and something that it makes sense 
complexity develops along the way from low entropy to high entropy but the details of how it actually happens 
an ongoing fun research problem and life is certainly just an example of exactly that lb right and so 
i think it would be arguably a tragedy on the universal scale in terms of just lost utility and 
potential and lost optionality even from just looking from an expected value standpoint if we were to go extinct 
if chance there is still going to be ten to i know how many possible lives and possibly very 
lives in the future sc i have met people who argue that the human race should go extinct that 
would be a moral good that the rest of the planet would be better off without us lb right 
assume extreme negative utilitarians in terms of they sc no no no just that the utility goes to the 
and the animals not to us we are a net negative they claim i believe them just saying it 
out there lb their main argument as to why we are a net negative just because we create suffering 
yeah highly distorting the ecosystem and so much of the biomass is devoted to keeping us happy and not 
natural state of being lb right but define natural the thing now i get into the semantics of that 
well yes right i wanna defend this just laying it out there lb no i mean definitely an interesting 
point to discuss and i have to say intuit my intuitions are i grew up in nature i love 
more than anything and nothing upsets me more than seeing images of the rainforest these millions and millions of 
old beautiful unbelievably complex rainforest a tree being cut down into planks of wood something so unbelievably complex and 
this intricate framework of an ecosystem around it all the insects and animals and fungi and everything that grows 
it and relies upon it is reduced to mere planks of wood that people then we put our coffee 
on sc coffee table yeah lb put down into this complicated economic system out of this complex and i 
two very different things complex ecologicalism so intuitively it seems like a huge tragedy that we are doing that 
i also think intuitively a huge tragedy that this human consciousness that does seem so i know inherently special 
definitely something inherently unique that not seeing elsewhere in the natural world as much and for that to go 
and the thing is is if we go extinct well chances are probably all the other most of the 
big animals will go extinct too as well sc i just want it on the record that we are 
this conversation at a concrete table laughter not a rain forest wood table lb with metal legs yes very 
sc yes very morally correct in our living room here we probably really think that it affects that calculation 
or not the only civilization maybe it makes it more poignant right but we still want human beings to 
extinct even if one hundred million others out there there are plenty of people who think that there are 
hundred million others out there and waiting for us to grow up a little bit i have my suspicions 
crazy also but it is at least one of the options on the table lb yeah you rule anything 
the thing when dealing with something of such uncertainty like this and certainly humanity has a lot of growing 
to do but that said a lot of beauty and goodness in the things that we are doing and 
would be nice if we were given the opportunity to try and grow up sc and you have put 
money where your mouth is quite literally becoming interested not only in these philosophical questions but the applied questions 
how to be better people how to make the world a better place and the effect of altruism movement 
particular and you just talk it but started an organization is that right lb yeah sc so tell people 
effective altruism even is lb yeah so effective altruism is basically the combining the head and the heart when 
comes to philanthropy in doing good we all well the vast majority of us we wanna do good in 
world if we see someone suffering try and help them you see someone passed out in the street the 
human instinct is to usually go and check on them or a dog yelping or whatever it is someone 
all for the most part naturally altruistic and a great thing but at the same time there will also 
different ways be some ways which are more effective at getting a certain problem alleviated and so effective altruism 
basically applying science to philanthropy to altruism doing good as effectively and efficiently as possible i remember hearing about 
that i wanted to give money to for example environmental charities but i often just felt lost i was 
where do i concerned about climate change concerned about biodiversity loss etcetera etcetera all these different things how do 
weigh these off against each other when i give my money to one charity that means actively not giving 
money to another we only have limited resources ever to give lb and so imperative that we do as 
research we can or at least consult people who have done the research to figure out where we can 
the biggest positive impact with whatever we give whether not just money as well time if you choose to 
for a charity you wanna make sure that the actions that you are taking in your line of work 
achieving the most good because you get those hours back time is also a scarce resource and so after 
all these arguments i was like this makes a lot of and a team of fulltime effective altruists they 
look we think poker players will get very used to thinking in numbers about uncomfortable things comfortable with the 
of sort of thinking about expected value and uncertainty sc variance yeah lb yeah variance quantifying things and poker 
i think are willing to despite the impression that all like dark degenerate sc degenerate gamblers yes lb yeah 
actually i think a lot of poker players are aware of a unique position that they have in terms 
we have time and we can make good money and it would be nice to contribute to society in 
way and so we decided to start this organization called raising for effective giving regcharityorg sc raising is upon 
raising exactly pile on the chips thing sc okay good lb even when i have many arguments about who 
up with the name laughter lb but yeah me but sc why there is a chance that not gonna 
yeah lb yeah no one will ever know and yeah so four of us poker players started it alongside 
swiss effective altruists and originally we were encouraging poker players to give of their profits sorry of their no 
winnings every quarter and some people sort of continue on that model others just sort because poker is a 
allornothing kind of game often have a big win followed by months of losing sc months and months yes 
yeah and so generally people just tend to donate when they have a big win as a percentage and 
been extraordinarily well received i had no idea that poker players would sc interesting lb get it as much 
they did and raised over six dollars million now so the charities are they use givewell who you might 
givewellorg which is a sc givewell is usually where i go when i have two dollars to throw in 
yeah fantastic in terms of like human suffering reduction they are the goto in terms of you wanna find 
how you can help human lives right now as best as possible so we use their top three recommended 
which are almost always against malaria foundation and something deworming and direct poverty alleviation with like givedirectly and because 
cost to save a human life like it or hate it unfortunately is just many hundreds of times cheaper 
around one hundred times cheaper in the developing world than it is here say in the us or in 
uk in the us the government will spend up to around one dollars million to save a life on 
you look at sort of cross healthcare and that kind of thing and yet you can demonstratively save a 
in some parts of subsaharan africa for around seven thousand dollars so a huge huge difference sc right lb 
even if you think that an american life is worth more than someone say from malawi do you really 
that worth a would you press that button to say will kill one hundred malawians to save one random 
not all about an american you know like someone random from america in a part never been to would 
really say worth one hundred mothers are worth one mother here no and so yeah about this sort of 
unfortunately you do you have to like put a price effect it is not putting a price on a 
life but about saying actions i can help someone with the money that i give and so i want 
help as many people as possible with lb and so yes got the best charities in human suffering alleviation 
best ones in animal suffering alleviation by best i mean most costeffective and the animal ones almost always have 
do with antifactory farming just pretty tragic going on out there and very very cheap to save various sentient 
from a life of misery and then we also have neglected research areas specifically ones looking into things like 
catastrophic risk sc okay cool lb so yeah like people looking into risk from bioterrorism sc because even if 
tiny lb exactly yes even though a chance if you factor that over the one hundred billion or so 
that are gonna exist over the next century roughly what the number is even over the next century a 
of people sc it seems kind of obvious that we should try to be efficient and spend our charitable 
as effectively as possible but there has been push back right i mean some people like it personally confess 
a utilitarian i think that hard to be a consistent utilitarian but still i take the effective altruism to 
a good nudge in the right direction right lb right sc we certainly do value the things we see 
in front of our eyes more than the things we know are going on out there in the world 
this is an excellent reminder that ways to make a huge impact elsewhere in the world that might not 
quite as obvious to us lb exactly not not saying that if you react to something immediately happening in 
of you that not a good way of doing good of course good there and a big part of 
you do good trying to do something altruistic and help fine to also feel good about it i think 
go you have any positive emotions that come out of or be doing in that i think silly no 
wanna do whatever continues to motivate you sc yeah get that dopamine from giving a good donation lb absolutely 
so like i said about balancing not just the head but also just the heart the heart is a 
part of any kind of charity giving and so on and i think a mistake to try and remove 
out of it but at the same time we have to be aware that just purely acting emotionally when 
know that we have these big biases in terms of we randomly will sort of value people who happen 
live in the same town as from someone who lives in a town one hundred miles away even though 
know either of them just because just the way human intuitions are sort of built and that can then 
a mistake in terms of our sort of narrow resources that we have to allocate sc maybe from what 
said earlier be a good charity that could give everyone free poker lessons it would help them think in 
ways about the world lb i specifically say that but yeah there is a charity there are at least 
of who train young people in applied rationality so quantifying things which is basically applied poker at all talk 
poker but they training promising young people who are looking to get into sort of research politics you name 
the art of rationality which is incredibly important because these are going to be the future leaders and i 
we want leaders who are aware of human biases and afraid to think in sort of scientific terms to 
them the tools to understand their own emotions and so on and therefore be better equipped decisionmakers and i 
an incredibly valuable thing and these kind of organizations that are looking into teaching rationality classes in schools i 
these are incredibly promising area to donate to because they can create definitely a huge lack in our current 
system how many kids are taught to think through their feelings for example yeah like okay to be uncertain 
if we can estimate our lb these basic rationality tools that you and i take for granted we only 
them because we learnt them as adults either through poker or through another means but imagine if you were 
taught these basic things or learning to think through the counterfactuals something like that i wish i had learned 
when i was laughter lb it saved me so much time yeah just looking up the probabilities i used 
be a huge hypochondriac the amount of worrying time spent going is my headache a brain if just learnt 
do a bit of bayesian updating that saved me a lot of misery over in my late teens and 
yeah i think a big shame that these areas are neglected sc well i think a perfect place to 
because basically encapsulated the mission statement of this podcast trying to get people to think a little bit more 
a little bit more cognizantly of their biases and a little bit thinking in different ways than they usually 
so liv boeree thanks so much for coming on the podcast lb thank you sean music great podcast only 
platforms allow for a convergence on topics most would have thought to be utterly alienated as a former poker 
never a winner i wait to hear this you must tight control over your nervous system i have found 
of a loss prior to entry into a poker tournament is the best way to approach it so you 
have lost the money before you played your first hand this throws out the probability logic and you can 
the game with the tools you have you people piss me off telling me what hand i have and 
you are correct pingback poker sean carroll interviews physicist and professional poker player liv boeree the daily galaxy listened 
you from jre and thought you were great currently studying at an ivy and these sort of podcasts are 
of my favorite i think that you definitely take the conversation to the next level while this obviously may 
the target audience it is of course by design however i think that many people may be put off 
the somewhat lenghty meta commentary on the beginning since i saw you on jre i knew it worth it 
stay but i do think it may act as a deterrent for people who are only just hearing of 
perhaps the meta commentary may be best served into a separate part of the website an section of sort 
the indepth conversations and quality and would like to see this succeed comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations
