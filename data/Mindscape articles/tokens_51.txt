today we have a fun interdisciplinary episode looking at the area where music meets neuroscience had a little bit 
music we had wynton marsalis after all quite a bit of neuroscience but never looked at this particular issue 
them up how we learn about music and how music helps us learn how it changes us as people 
indre viskontas is a phd neuroscientist and she still does neuroscientific research but her main focus has become music 
is an opera singer someone who gets up there and belts out the arias on stage but also someone 
creates new musical projects the creative director of the pasadena opera for example so very natural that she would 
this question of how musical influence changes going on in our brain and also how going on in our 
creates different kinds of music how it inspires us to do different things her most recent book is called 
music can make you better the idea being that in various ways not only do we learn music but 
helps us learn other things helps us train our minds helps us be sociable and can even have therapeutic 
sc so been a lot of fun to learn about this while reading the book and talking with indre 
the podcast because neuroscience you know one of those things where we learn a lot been enormous progress in 
years and months constantly new neuroscientific discoveries coming down the pike but so much that we know so easy 
ask a question in neuroscience to which we know the answer so do both of that hear some of 
fun new results that have been coming out but also point at a lot of areas where we exactly 
what music and the brain are doing with each other one way or the other sc i should also 
that indre has her own podcasts two of them in fact one is called inquiring minds which appeared on 
other is a new one called cadence which is specifically about music and the mind here at the mindscape 
we have the news that be joining the wondery podcast network the folks who will be giving us the 
to eventually play here on the podcast episodes so if you want to tell wondery a bit about the 
of mindscape listeners welcome to go to wonderycomsurvey look for the little button that says sean mindscape and tell 
a little bit about yourself that will help them decide what kinds of ads we should have wonderycomsurvey and 
that this is going to be a very fun episode so go music sc indre viskontas welcome to the 
podcast indre viskontas thanks so much for having me sc so sure heard this before but you have a 
unusual than most job description splitting your time between being a neuroscientist and being an opera singer and generally 
of a musical person as well as having a whole separate outreach component in fact let me be a 
podcast host and let you plug your own podcast that you have iv sure i actually have two now 
one that is weekly is called inquiring minds and a sort of broad view of science and society we 
where science and society collide and then i launched a couple of years ago a podcast called cadence what 
tells us about the mind which has had two seasons come out much more produced the seasons are eight 
ten episodes and it was actually the inspiration for a book that i think hopefully we will talk about 
laughter sc we might talk about the book yeah iv and so working on the third season now which 
going to be about how music influences us which really excited about sc wow iv so we were about 
through having recorded the interviews so hopefully come out in a few weeks sc okay fantastic but you had 
phd in neuroscience still practicing research in neuroscience right iv mmhmm a little bit a little bit sc yeah 
yeah the kinda research i do now is much more kind of applied research that i find interesting that 
think might help me become a better performer or me become a better teacher or somehow that i could 
that nobody else can do rather than having a big lab where running subjects all the time sc no 
can quickly become an administrator and a fulltime job right iv yeah exactly so i do that but tell 
about one study that kind of excited about so recently gotten interested in how technology can change our minds 
can help us become more efficient if not less efficient as in the case of most chuckle technology it 
makes us less efficient as we try to multitask and so i was really skeptical of this idea that 
could stimulate your brain into becoming a better pianist right chuckle sc ah yes iv i know if seen 
of these ads but a company called halo neuroscience that made this headset commercially available and transcranial direct stimulation 
supposed to essentially stimulate the motor cortex put it into what they call a hyperplastic mode which means kind 
more open to change and then you practice your instrument or you work on some kind of athletic skill 
supposed to increase the efficacy with which you can train and so examining that trying to see whether true 
our students at the conservatory of music so highly motivated professional grade musicians and so the kind of research 
do now like is this really something that might actually work and if it does work are there protocols 
we should think about that would make it most effective sc so the music and the neuroscience view are 
two separate things doing a thing and part of that thing is neuroscience and part is music is that 
iv yes totally fair i mean really interested in how the brain changes overall even my phd was about 
and to me music is a kind of a really great model of neuroplasticity because we can easily measure 
that happen with training even single exposures to music can leave their signatures in the brain just like virtually 
other experience that is immersive in some way so interesting to me as a model but more so music 
me is a really powerful way of looking at what it means to be human because so bizarre like 
is it that laughter we can fall in love over music we can incite hate over music i mean 
get killed because they play the wrong rap song or performed the wrong rap song and so why so 
ultimately right laughter sc yeah iv these are just rarefactions and compressions of air steven pinker will argue totally 
language is much more important and yet pretty hard to kill somebody with words chuckle not that easy to 
somebody with music but it does seem to really powerfully incite people to behave in ways that they might 
otherwise sc something visceral about it yeah some connection and so i do want to get into where that 
from but first not just that you like music and study it you do it so fill in the 
what it means when i say that you do music iv sure so forever since i can remember i 
a singer when i was a kid i grew up in choirs and then i started doing opera and 
during my graduate work as a phd student in neuroscience i maintained my love of music and i would 
away every week for lessons and coachings and then in the summers go off to europe and perform a 
somewhere in some small company or training program and so it was always a part of me and then 
i graduated from my phd i just realized that i really needed to give it a shot whatever that 
sc right iv so i went and got a in music and now i perform i would say that 
performing life maybe makes up a quarter or maybe of my actual income generating or kind of projectbased work 
a really important part of it and so now i kind of do at least one or two big 
performance projects a year sc and that includes not just singing but a musical director or something like that 
yeah so the creative director of a little company that i founded with a friend of mine dana sadava 
artistic director called pasadena opera and we picked pasadena your backyard sc yeah iv for two reasons one a 
intellectual community there and generally people who are welleducated tend to be more likely to have been exposed to 
and therefore like it and also a lot of history of arts focus in pasadena and a kind of 
in the community towards cultural change sc right iv and so we were really interested in starting a company 
that would really be about putting on opera accessible interesting relevant and that speaks to whatever is going on 
the community sc so how many operas have you put on iv put on four and in the midst 
putting our fifth is actually our first commission sc okay iv so really committed to supporting living composers so 
commissioned a new yorkbased composer named daniel felsenfeld to write an opera based on a novel by a feminist 
the named angela carter she used to she wrote these retold fairy tales with feminist endings and she was 
was kind of forgotten in her time and her works have kind of resurfaced interestingly through this me too 
maybe but maybe because feminism is always changing sc yeah iv anyway so this retelling of the bluebeard castle 
which is this psychological thriller where you have bluebeard some kind of big rich aristocrat whatever you want to 
him he brings his new bride home and he says to her have access to this entire house except 
one sc right iv and a real metaphor for marriage or partnership where like how like do you really 
your whole self be open to your partner or do you keep a little bit to yourself chuckle maybe 
darkest part and of course she opens that door she help herself and in it are all his dead 
sc bad things happen yes right laughter yeah yeah i could have guessed that right she ever watch tv 
on iv yeah no so spoiling it for you only because the ending is different in the bloody chamber 
is what called so really excited to put that on and so going on in january of sc cool 
watch out for that and when you are performing singing right i iv yes sc opera singing just the 
comes fraught with people being a little bit scared different than other kinds of singing it looks hard the 
are very high why did you pick the hardest kind of singing there is to do chuckle iv yeah 
is hard to me the only kind of singing where and even these days kind of changing but there 
any in my opinion amplification so there should be nothing separating the human voice from the audience sc right 
and why it sounds weird because in order to project in a big space you have to be able 
make a lot of noise but it still has to sound pretty so what we train for so many 
to do to use our bone structure our resonance our diaphragm our lungs to be able to project sound 
far as it can possibly go but still sound beautiful to me i love the aesthetic of it i 
the sound i grew up listening to it so very comfortable for me but i also just love the 
sc yeah iv i mean opera is big sc the spectacle iv yeah yeah i mean you you know 
the opera would be a really tough sell chuckle sc it was the game of thrones of its time 
yeah yeah well game of thrones would make a great opera i mean epic epic in some ways the 
ring cycle is laughter sc there you go right iv kind of really mild version of game of thrones 
yeah so i think what appeals to me about it is that i have this connection to it to 
beautiful and challenging like anybody who pursues any athletic thing why do people do gymnastics really hard sc i 
that one either yeah laughter iv but a kind of euphoria that comes with doing something hard and being 
to do it well sc and now coming come out with a book that combines your passions for neuroscience 
music what is the title iv yeah called how music can make you better and left kind of an 
question mark of course the first thing better at what better at how chuckle sc exactly yes iv and 
answer is just better in many different ways so the first is really divided up into three sections the 
section is sort of how does your brain turn sound into music and essentially make sound better which to 
is really fascinating and the second part is what people are more expecting to hear which is can it 
heal my brain or body and so i talk about different ways that music is used in medicine but 
is it effective in terms of a workout tool that kind of thing and then finally i turn to 
music can make society better in my opinion probably why it evolved the way it did because a powerful 
glue it helps us communicate when we have language or communicate ideas and emotions that surpass language but it 
also be used in ways that are not so good to incite violence to get people to create tribes 
groups that then are identified on the sc fight songs right iv yeah fight songs exactly so those are 
three sections sc cool so good we have time to get into this so let me just start with 
before we get to music what about sound what do we know about what happens when you hear something 
happens in the brain and i actually know a little bit about the visual process of the brain i 
nothing about how we perceive sound iv huh huh well yeah it surprises me because i feel like all 
laughter sc well sorry just to explain when i was at the university of chicago i was on the 
thesis committee for some students who were physics graduate students but studying neuroscience of the visual cortex iv oh 
okay okay sc why i know something about that iv got it got it got it and by the 
right at the top when a pot calling the kettle black a little bit here sean laughter multiple interests 
physicist who in my opinion wrote one of the best books about consciousness ever written sc oh thank you 
so yeah but okay so start with what sound is right so sound is just rarefactions and compressions of 
for some reason our species has decided that the way it samples sound is by turning it into a 
experience that we recognize as sound or sound waves i should say so we can imagine that this could 
been very different right like the way a bat hears through echolocation is probably very different probably more like 
visual system and so that is kind of arbitrary part of the way that we evolved is sc actually 
we know if the way that bats think about sound sort of melds with the visual system differently than 
does in humans iv well i would i know the answer to that question very deeply except to say 
if i were a bat and i i think of echolocation as a way of seeing the world because 
use it to navigate and to find things so there are a couple of stories one in particular that 
of a kid named ben underwood who when he was do you know the story of ben underwood sc 
iv when he was two he lost his eyes to cancer and he developed the ability to echolocate so 
are these amazing videos that you can yeah watch on sc oh maybe i do know him iv yeah 
maybe been on stage with him iv oh laughter okay sc i just forgot his name iv okay yeah 
underwood sc yeah he clicks iv so he clicks right and how he sees so unfortunately he died but 
would have loved sc oh then i know him i know someone else who had the same ability iv 
okay so maybe yeah maybe there are others who do this to me really fascinating and if you were 
of these people that does this please please please reach out i really want to talk to you about 
sc i can get you in touch the guy who i was on stage with they have a school 
la and they teach blind people to echolocate iv oh okay oh so cool sc yeah iv oh yes 
i have to go and see that because i think the answer to our question is i mean what 
to happen is that they repurpose their visual cortex to use sound to essentially navigate through the world so 
just wonder what that experience is like for them sc yeah iv i mean do they actually in their 
see the sound sc and a reason why thomas famous piece is what is it like to be a 
it must be so different than being a person iv exactly and why i chose the bat analogy because 
that exact piece and so what anyway so that chuckle already gets us down one rabbit hole so i 
what like to be a bat but i imagine different from what like for me to hear sound sc 
iv and so anyway so developed this ability to somehow turn these sound waves into something that we now 
of as sound we have a cochlea which is the inner part of your ear that essentially does this 
it literally a fluidfilled structure that has all these little hair cells and the hair cells sway as the 
moves to the pattern of the sound wave that opens these ion channels at the tips of the cells 
lets in essentially or changes the membrane potential it creates an electrical change which then your the language of 
brain right sc it almost makes you sympathetic to intelligent design when you hear these complicated kinds of things 
you trace it back in evolutionary time see how it developed iv well every cell has a membrane every 
exchanges ions one cell just happened to turn that into a different signal that also releases chemicals and blah 
blah yeah to me all like in some ways even more evidence that this is the process that is 
that just happened over these small little tweaks so anyway so we have like of these hair cells or 
like that and so we can tell different frequencies apart different timbres and so forth now imagine that your 
does not function and hard of hearing one thing that we can do is we can implant a cochlear 
for some of these patients and restore hearing to a way that is pretty remarkable so my friend charles 
an ear surgeon who does this kind of work he argues that in fact we can restore hearing better 
we can restore any other sense but not nearly perfect and we can talk about how sc a system 
iv and in my understanding of the history of cochlear implants people kind of thought you can just put 
electrode into the cochlea that kind but the problem is only going to have maybe ten to twenty leads 
opposed to hair cells and also then how are you going to teach the brain to interpret this signal 
my understanding of the history is that they were really worried about this for a long time and then 
some rogue ear surgeon just put one in laughter and it turns out they have to worry about it 
the sc well actually yeah i was going to guess that i know about the sensitivity and the ten 
tens of thousands but my impression from talking to neuroscientists is the brain figures out how to do things 
yeah exactly sc not just a module that only does one thing it figures it out iv yeah it 
about and if the person is motivated enough to continue to repeatedly try and repeatedly listen in that way 
try to make sense of it then the brain will help out so what happens in these patients they 
learn to understand speech which if you think about it is a really complex sound right the difference in 
sound wave between two words spoken by the same person is so minimal compared to all the other sounds 
yet able to do that able to essentially able to understand and speak a language they really learn to 
music music still is something sc really iv yeah like sometimes they give descriptions like it sounds like broken 
or it just sounds like noise i interviewed this one guy who basically has had a cochlear implant for 
long time and he was just like understand why anybody would pay a single dollar for a piece of 
what was this people who were deaf from birth iv yeah it really matter for the most part everybody 
somewhat different sc yeah iv so there are some people who were great music aficionados lost their hearing but 
for them in most cases the cochlear implant does not restore their love of music a person who like 
gentleman i was telling you about he was hard of hearing from a very early age and he still 
he but anyway one of my little research projects with charles limb actually was to create a choir of 
who are hard of hearing most of whom had cochlear implants in order to give them the motivation to 
the same kind of energy parsing music as they sc nice yeah iv parsing speech and we sort of 
these ipads in front of them where they could see their voice spectrograph like they can actually see the 
that they were making and we had the pitches colored in different colors and so in order like everybody 
in a what it sounds like on the we know what it sounds like for them with their cochlear 
but then we can say going to be green on your ipad so make noise until and so anyway 
we kind the kind of work i do but this is a long preamble to say essentially that ultimately 
we interpret sound as music depends on our brains sc clearly yeah iv and high up in there and 
if you like opera probably because you listened to it enough chuckle or just not interesting to you not 
that everybody ultimately has to like opera but usually it means that if there is a genre of music 
a lot of people really like a universally agreed upon good piece of music and you just like it 
of it might be because your brain is not processing it in the same way not finding meaning in 
same way like my mom for example hates rap she hates heavy metal and i think because it just 
like noise to her i mean if you brought a chainsaw into the room i would find that annoying 
but metallica i get laughter but not that different laughter sc right iv right sc yeah so how would 
define music what is it that separates music out from other sounds iv yeah so i think it depends 
every brain i think the question is how would you define it and why some things are music to 
people and not to others and even silence can be music as some experimental composers have demonstrated the context 
you bring in terms of how you listen to the soundscape so if listening to the soundscape for meaning 
goes beyond the speech or the kind of physical aspects of the sound like where is it located is 
a bird or a car then i would argue that music sc okay but in the music that we 
and love there are certain properties right the repetition versus variation kind of story iv yes exactly in fact 
is the one universal feature of virtually every music that we know of except the music that explicitly avoids 
which is sc but kind of postrepetition right like you knew what repetition iv exactly exactly doing sc and 
being ornery iv exactly and hard to listen to and in fact if you hack some of that music 
add repetition people will label it as more interesting more enjoyable and more likely to have been composed by 
human being laughter sc right iv so i think pretty good evidence that repetition is a key feature of 
and i think that the reason that it is is because that sort of sets the pattern right so 
can turn a simple sentence into music by repeating it over and over again add a beat add some 
kind of thing and all of a sudden got a piece of music and because i think the way 
your your brain habituates so you poke a california aplysia a sea slug on its tail a bunch of 
eventually it stops withdrawing its tail habituation very simple nervous system chuckle sc it just gets tired of putting 
with you iv yeah not getting any new information so if you are listening to a repeated pattern going 
search for new information on it or going to ignore it so your refrigerator hum probably have that much 
info so after living in your place for a couple of nights you ignore it you no longer hear 
but when it comes to music great music in my opinion has multiple layers of meanings that your brain 
finding and seeing and we are ultimately as you probably talk about it better than i can interested in 
search for meaning that why you went into physics sc right yeah laughter yes meaning and understanding yeah iv 
meaning and understanding so the same thing i think in terms of music especially when that meaning and understanding 
us something really authentic about humanity so this great quote by harlan about country music so country music is 
chords and the truth even if you like country music it gives me chills thinking about true of music 
truth is the hard part iv truth is the hard part but exactly right great music tells you something 
that you get in any other medium sc yeah whether or not there are words iv yeah whether or 
there are words sc the truth might transcend the sort of literal meaning of the words so you i 
now had this thought you mentioned that repetition rhythm in some sense is universal in how music gets done 
is melody universal iv yeah so i guess the two main components of music are rhythm and melody so 
think most people will argue that the vast majority of music out there has these two components and i 
that again i think it depends on exactly how you define melody and sure you can have a musicologist 
will talk about that for three hours not that person except to say i think of it as a 
that is recognizable that sometimes is repeated sometimes is not but has a kind of phrase quality to it 
beginning a middle and an end to a melody and recognizable as a line and that kind of speaks 
the fact that music is something that happens over time sc time is crucially important yeah iv crucially important 
so music is there in the moment and it kind of unfolds over time and the melody is kind 
what is the person taking the journey whereas the rhythm is the one setting the time scale sc yeah 
that makes sense so just sparking my brain with all these questions that never thought of before is there 
explanation for why traditionally music likes to pick a certain discrete set of notes rather than just if you 
a violin you could just play any note you wanted to but we agree ahead of time these are 
notes supposed to play the major scale or something like that iv sure and i think because it allows 
a kind of boundary or framework for where going to find these patterns and where going to extract the 
sc it certainly helps with repetition if only a finite number of choices to pick iv right right and 
different genres will have different rules whether jazz or rap or hiphop or classical music depending on the era 
will have different rules of tonality so how much can you deviate from the particular established tones so a 
of the really great composers like beethoven for example was like scandalously deviant sc really iv yeah from his 
and yet we listen to it as it seems so pleasant and almost uptight in its rulebased structure so 
think that in order for you to know and predict where the music is going to go there has 
be a kind of understanding of what the rules are so the example i started to give is jazz 
if you never listen to jazz then probably gravitate towards relatively simple riffs and melodies that is easily recognizable 
you you know where the melody is and you can kind of predict where going to go and it 
surprise you a little bit but not totally shocking iv now if you have a jazz aficionado smooth jazz 
is a lot of you just rolled your eyes excruciating because far too simple mindnumbingly boring in that sense 
nothing interesting about it like eating white bread so i think that that means that you listen to it 
so then when you listen to a really great jazz player and playing my funny valentine for example or 
other really famous melody but you barely recognize the melody in it but you know where going and it 
kind of fits in like this magical puzzle that listening to and really great iv so yeah so i 
again i think that depends on your genre and depends on within the genre how old the genre is 
much it has these established rules how much composers have had to push against these rules to create something 
and so on and all this is to say that it harnesses what i think of as the fundamental 
which is it wants to predict the future iv our memory is not about the past about giving us 
ability to create a potential future and see whether our behavior is going to make us survive or kill 
so really what ultimately music does it harnesses the desire to predict the future and so you create tension 
a musician for an ultimate release if you stop the piece before the tension is released unless really an 
or an intentional choice in which case annoyed your audience and your art iv so i think that kind 
have to be able to give our listeners enough information about what the future is going to hold for 
and then as great musicians we know that we can push and pull against that to tell them something 
or interesting sc do you know about the bayesian brain hypothesis have you heard of that iv i know 
theorem so yeah tell me more about the bayesian brain hypothesis sc karl friston who apparently is a famous 
neuroimaging guy sc yeah exactly so a little funny he got very famous and a billion citations etcetera for 
but now his whole thing is this grand unified theory of the brain called the free energy principle or 
bayesian brain hypothesis and basically a formalization of exactly what you said all the brain tries to do is 
the future so called bayesian because constantly updating when you get new information in and trying to minimize the 
is that happens and he tries very controversial some people love it some people hate it lots of people 
would love it but i understand what but probably too simple to be exactly true but i think probably 
true about it iv yeah and i think actually really important from a neuroscience perspective to put it out 
like that i think that takes a lot of courage especially nowadays anyway we have access to so much 
information than it seems like we did thirty years ago but yeah i probably would endorse a lot of 
particular idea sc well so you mentioned the difference between a simplistic pop song and a outré jazz improvisation 
also mentioned in the book that there are two points in a life when they are especially susceptible to 
and being impressed by music iv yeah yeah sc one is when a kid and very young iv exactly 
i almost think like maybe of course as you know you write a book and then a bunch of 
goes by and then it comes out and so like i wish i had written this sometimes i think 
it really is about the early period which is like early childhood is essentially when your auditory cortex is 
is when your brain is learning to process sound so kids who are trained as musicians early on their 
literally react to sound differently even if they stop playing piano or stop learning their instruments many many years 
we can still see the kind of sc something was wired in there iv something was wired in there 
you take a kid exposed to a lot of extraneous noise who has to actually tune it out then 
relationship with sound is going to be different and in fact some of these kids who grow up in 
environments who generally are more likely to be lowincome because exposed to a lot of noise that be tuned 
they sometimes have trouble with language skills later on in life because just not hearing they have trouble parsing 
out of noise iv so you can imagine that a problematic thing and if you teach them to play 
musical instrument you can actually undo some of this damage because what doing is essentially retraining their brain to 
sound differently to have this different neural signature when it comes to a sound stimulus or a sound wave 
the early period so kind of like the nuts and bolts of sc sorry that is when we like 
most simple and repetitive stuff like the wheels on the bus go round and round iv exactly exactly exactly 
part of that is because the kid is trying to figure he likes to predict the future too why 
kids like these songs that never end like baby shark all these things this is right for earworms sc 
calvin and hobbes cartoon that calvin is grumpy he clearly just got upbraided by his mom and he says 
if a novelty christmas song is funny once funny the thousandth time iv yeah i know they understand why 
illogical why it funny the thousandth time well learn but i think that the second period is what i 
of more as kind of the emotional the part of your life that you always return to nostalgically through 
the part of your life where your brain your prefrontal cortex which is the last part of your brain 
develop and wire up essentially when being myelinated when this fatty sheet that is wrapping itself around the connections 
neurons to make them faster and more efficient and the front part of your brain is where you do 
lot of complex decisionmaking emotional regulation social interactions these kind of higher level cognitive and human traits so all 
in your late teens and even into your early sc so tell me more about the myelinating i think 
know anything about that iv yeah so myelination is essentially one of the reasons that we have the brains 
we do is because we as mammals and vertebrates have developed the ability to make our axons more efficient 
the axon is the part of the cell that takes information from the cell body from the dendrites and 
it wire essentially and then lets out information on the other end so in order to be able to 
large swaths of brain or to go from your spinal cord to your big toe we need that signal 
be really fast so one of the ways that the nervous system has evolved to make it faster is 
myelinating essentially covering it with a fatty sheath like think about it insulating a wire so the electrical changes 
out all the way down the action potential just propagates essentially it jumps called saltatory conduction so you can 
of it as like got a bus in your local town it can make a stop at every single 
sign which makes it really slow more people have to get in and out or you can have the 
bus that is the express right sc yeah right iv so myelin creates express buses out of our axons 
does it happen to every axon or is it the most important ones iv i mean you know never 
every in chuckle neuroscience but the vast majority sc huh and you have to be a teenager before that 
iv you have to be a teenager before that happens in the prefrontal cortex sc oh iv so in 
rest of the brain happening earlier on and this is actually one of the reasons why it seems that 
people who ultimately develop schizophrenia have their first psychotic breaks or their first disorganized thinking episodes around their early 
teens because as the healthy teenage brain or neurotypical teenage brain is myelinating up and becoming more rational and 
to control your emotions the brain of a person with schizophrenia is not myelinating in the same way and 
their thoughts become disorganized they start to have these other experiences so yeah so myelination of the prefrontal cortex 
to be what is happening during these late teenage years sc but this worries me into thinking that something 
freezes about you when a teenager baked in iv well i mean a lot of people argue that some 
your personality traits do get formed there although this really interesting now kind of movement in personality psychology to 
that like do we actually change pretty substantially in terms of our personality as we get older but yes 
traditional model is that developing a lot of a lot of the your habits of thinking i should say 
this time period sc okay so myelinating but you also have raging hormones going through iv yup sc and 
to tunes with your friends iv yes because you have a push to separate from your parents right i 
better for you to go off and have sex with people who are not genetically related to you right 
so you need to leave the family nest sc yes iv so there seems to be the kind of 
part of our nature that comes online here which you could imagine is actually very evolutionarily adaptive and so 
we like to be alone right we want to feel isolated especially when having these big emotions and we 
regulate them yet and all these things everything selfesteem is coming into play but pimply and gangly and everything 
a lot sc i know why there are people who think that those were the good times in their 
but they exist yeah iv the terrible times yeah so one of things great about music is that a 
social glue so when you when you bounce in sync with someone else to music you actually raise levels 
an attachment hormone called oxytocin in both of your brains and that makes you feel more bonded so there 
some clever little experiments where have people bouncing in sync with each other to a particular piece of music 
in sync with the experimenter and then the experiment finishes and thank you very much and the debriefing sheet 
me just walk you to the and on the way to the elevator you drop a pencil how likely 
the person to pick it up sc huh iv it turns out that if you bounced in sync much 
likely laughter sc is that a reproduced thing though chuckle iv and been reproduced in toddlers nonetheless sc wow 
so toddlers will also be more likely to help an accidentally dropped toy if they were bounced in sync 
the adult or by the friend but not if a neutral person in the room that seems to be 
stranger so there does seem to be some kind of attachment that happens where you tend to then associate 
person that you were in sync with literally physically as part of your tribe and people who out of 
with as another tribe sc i wonder if mirror neurons have something to do with that iv i mean 
sure for sure sc yeah iv or at least the mirror neuron system this idea that in our brains 
mirror the activity of the brains of the person that watching as they perform some goaldirected activity right so 
and related to empathy but this kind of synchronization fostered by more oxytocin this is all prosocial bonding stuff 
people sometimes think of oxytocin as the love hormone right not you know much more accurate to say the 
hormone because also the hate hormone sc right iv so you actually feel more aggression towards people you deem 
threatening your tribe or outside of your tribe when high on oxytocin sc i had patricia churchland on the 
recently and the same message like oxytocin very very important but more is going on than you might think 
way more sc i still going to call it the cuddle molecule chuckle just an irresistible name sorry iv 
and you still might be skeptical you know how you know you can snort oxytocin now you can you 
these oxytocin sprays sc i know that laughter iv like these nasal sprays and if a study that i 
like where if you spray people with this or you give them this oxytocin nasal spray they actually keep 
rhythm better sc really iv it like gives them rhythm laughter yeah it makes them more in sync when 
the rhythm molecule alright laughter iv yeah well i mean if you think about what it means to be 
sync with someone it seems like that would make sense chuckle sc alright the synchronization molecule this is connecting 
whole bunch of different podcast topics i talked to steven strogatz about synchronization in different animal systems iv oh 
yeah sc wow okay so yeah and but this story helps explain why we always have a special attachment 
the tunes that we really fell in love with when we were teenagers right iv yeah sc even if 
look back and with a slightly more jaundiced eye we say i get that not the best song ever 
but my iv right right i mean it especially the first time you hear it again after a while 
still gives you this rush of nostalgia this rush of feeling this rush of kind of security that you 
found in the music that you loved it helped you find yourself in your tribe but exactly right that 
can recognize that it is actually not objectively good music and still have this good effect interesting is that 
feel like we actually tire of it more quickly though so imagine that you your favorite song from when 
were a teenager or your early can you name one or a favorite band sc yeah i can name 
bunch let me name yes iv yes okay now say you spent all day listening to yes how soon 
you start getting sick of it sc well so the thing the reason why i named yes is because 
recently i i know why but i redownloaded an album that they came out with when i was in 
i started listening to it and i cannot get that thing out of my head anymore it is embedded 
and reading your book made me think about that iv oh great yeah sc so sadly apparently i can 
to it again and again not quite as elevated as some of the other people talking about iv but 
you enjoy it as much i feel like in my experience at least anyway and i have any science 
back this up but it seems that yes when you hear them again for the first time it feels 
it feels like finding your own teenage self again which is really encouraging if not that close to your 
years anymore but i also find that i get bored more quickly sc well you certainly want to move 
but you also mentioned the idea of the earworm that sometimes we really find it difficult to move on 
a melody that is stuck in our head iv yeah and i think there are certain characteristics of melodies 
make them more likely to be stuck in their heads and things like baby shark or wheels on the 
have this problem where never ending so there an ultimate release sc no resolution iv no resolution and so 
brain is like yeah i got that in my head and then it just keeps looping especially if not 
very close attention to it so one of the cures for earworms is to in your head like volitionally 
up a big ending put a big finish onto the piece work it through and then hopefully your brain 
be like now done i can move but if that work and this is really troubling to you it 
out that medicines that are used for people with obsessive compulsive disorder can be effective in getting rid of 
most severe types of earworms and because essentially it becomes a little bit of an obsession and we see 
overactive caudate nucleus which is a nucleus in your brain that is part of the kind of goaldirected motivated 
system part of your reward sc you have to explain that not my kind of nucleus not an atomic 
using the word nucleus to mean something different iv yes yes yes no i guess i forget that a 
is a group of cell bodies in the brain sc okay good and the caudate nucleus what does it 
iv the caudate nucleus so yeah part of the reward system and essentially you think of it as the 
part of the brain so in the anticipation of something pleasurable or actually something awful you can see more 
activity in the caudate nucleus and the caudate nucleus is also like if you lesion it then animals have 
hard time learning new kind of habits and skills so patients with disease for example or disease have less 
in the brain and the caudate is affected anyway so they have learning problems iv so the caudate when 
comes to music we see it active during the building up of tension part of a musical phrase and 
once you get the release of tension if you get the chills maybe or some other kind of reaction 
see a big spike in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens which is the liking part of the brain so 
the caudate does the wanting part of the brain the nucleus accumbens is the liking part of the brain 
it actually gives you the sense of pleasure as opposed to the pursuit of pleasure iv so anyway the 
is really fascinating been implicated in a lot of human behaviors that are hard to understand for example people 
have anorexia we think now it might be partly to do with a habit of not eating so that 
find eating aversive and we see an overactive caudate in the sense so not just the desire to be 
just that eating is unpleasant it becomes habitually unpleasant and so the worst thing that you can do is 
a person with anorexia because then you give them a really aversive experience sc associating misery with iv even 
sc which is not what you want iv and the caudate is a part of that sort of tracking 
aspects of the world that will lead to good things or bad things but regardless things that are important 
so this is also why a lot of people who overdose tend to do so in novel environments like 
rooms because your i know going to connect the dots sc good no no no almost there iv your 
expects a drug if you take it in the same place at the same time and so interested in 
homeostasis so it swings in the other direction so say you take a drug that makes you feel down 
benzodiazepines they actually inhibit brain activity they sedate you get rid of your anxiety now say you take a 
of these drugs you have to take more and more of them to get the effect because your brain 
expecting them trying to predict the future so giving you actually more anxiety more stress more activity so that 
need more of the drug to get back down iv now say you go into a novel environment you 
the same dose of the drug been taking in your old environment but your brain is not prepared for 
when you overdose so the same exact amount can now be fatal and because your caudate was not prepared 
in the other locations your caudate is trying to figure out what is it about this environment going to 
this good thing to happen sc now sort of surprised that led zeppelin could ever write stairway to heaven 
knowing all this neuroscience they actually manipulated the caudate nuclei of all their audience members without knowing what they 
doing iv exactly exactly what they did and great musicians know this they know that in order to have 
great piece of music you need to delay the release of tension as long as possible the longer you 
the desire for the pleasure the greater the pleasure when it comes and pleasure is the death of desire 
yeah sc and some tradeoff you extend it too long iv well yeah people would get frustrated sc exactly 
i want to talk about music and learning and this sort of has two sides to it one is 
we learn music so what is the neuroscience of how we learn music let me just mention one fact 
i read in your book which actually i thought was absolutely fascinating the musicians certain musicians play their instrument 
much that when playing two of their fingers always move in the same way in synchrony together and their 
begins to forget that two separate fingers their brain remaps and i always heard that the other way around 
the brain can sort of remap extra parts but i had never thought about the brain forgetting that a 
there iv yeah this is the dark side of neuroplasticity called focal dystonia so essentially where you have a 
body part which now your brain has trouble decoupling you know in this particular and still learning exactly how 
works but the idea i think been gaining traction is that in some musicians you perform the same pattern 
and over again or you train your hands to be in sync in a certain way and then all 
a sudden your brain actually remaps your somatosensory cortex as that being just as you said one finger rather 
two fingers and so now very hard for you to decouple them and play them one at a time 
it becomes actually a problem and you can develop cramp these other kind of really really painful annoying conditions 
so a pianist would never get this their fingers are doing different things so what kind of musicians iv 
are pianists have gotten it but i think yeah mainly seen it in guitarists wind instruments but yes you 
get it in piano although it might sort of look a little bit different where not just maybe the 
it may be a part of the palm and a sc sure okay iv you know where you have 
kind of mapping or just some other kind of mapping gone awry basically but yeah i had a student 
whom it was the pinky finger and the ring finger that got associated she was a clarinetist sc okay 
and so she did and so then she had all these consequences where she would get nervous and then 
would start shaking and yeah these kind of neurological things that you sit there and you think do your 
really annoying sc and they do it iv brain brain do your thing right sc yeah iv and so 
painstaking then rehabilitation period where you have to retrain your brain to kind of map it differently again sc 
how much of learning to be a musician is subconscious in some way how much is cognitive iv yeah 
i mean you know just like playing a musical instrument or singing has so many complex different subskills i 
say hard to say that kind of in a blanket statement lots of conscious aspects of music making you 
the interpretation the music reading if what doing etcetera but in terms of just the pure motor skill i 
to think of this threestage model by a guy named fitz that i like where things start clumsy and 
like when your teacher tells you you gotta hold your bow arm has to be in this direction like 
your elbow or whatever you actually have to literally sit there and think about it sc yeah it feel 
iv it feel natural you have and in order to do it you have to consciously say arm lift 
over time over multiple repetitions you start to associate when going to pick up the bow going to do 
sequence of right and so called the associative stage where essentially what doing is automatizing parts of the motor 
but you still usually have to think about how to implement them so another example is driving stick shift 
to drive stick shift at the beginning like do you mean laughter first gear second gear or third gear 
then eventually like every time i shift gears i have to put the clutch down i get but then 
you have to put it all together and then eventually you get to the automatic stage where now implicit 
in fact if you start thinking about it too much you can actually interfere with your ability to do 
task right iv and this is because happened in your brain is that gone from what we call explicit 
a declarative memory version of the task where actually thinking consciously to a nondeclarative or implicit performance of the 
and these two systems can compete with each other for your cognitive resources so you want to interfere with 
implicit learning if you can avoid it but then eventually if you become really good at what doing like 
give the example of tiger woods who in the middle of a golf swing he can check his swing 
readjust if he needs to even though a lot of it is very automatic sort of bringing consciousness back 
the automated sc oh okay a higher level of conscious influence on going on iv yeah yeah so you 
like yoyo ma playing a cello suite and somebody in the audience coughs right like he it probably bother 
at all or some kind of breeze that happens or one of his strings breaks or what have you 
can adjust while doing on the fly because so good at what he does sc interesting and is it 
that we get worse at learning how to play music as we get older chuckle iv so you know 
think we still have the same expectations of things happening quickly as we get older we often spend the 
amount of time doing things as we get older you know what i mean sc long suspected that people 
the difficulty of learning things as you grow older just they remember how much work it was iv right 
and in fact in studies in which pitted young kids against college age adults like in a motor tapping 
for example the college students do better quickly it takes them fewer tries sc yeah but what about chuckle 
well i know that done that study laughter sc okay probably get them to volunteer iv yeah i i 
i know this gary marcus book guitar zero where he documents his own journey through this and i have 
disagree with him in a lot of parts of his book because i just believe that the way that 
was approaching the deliberate practice component is going to be the same as somebody devoting all i mean i 
he spent a year learning to play the guitar and so forth but a year like any college student 
my music program in their first year barely surviving by their fourth year of doing this every single day 
feedback with training that they start to make serious gains so i think an unreasonable expectation that we can 
something very quickly as we get older without putting in the same kind of time sc so trying to 
hope to those of us beyond our hormonal teen age years when it comes iv yeah yeah i mean 
you if you really can most of us just have the time and the money to chuckle devote to 
we need to do but if you have it i think any reason why you be able to do 
really exceptional with an instrument sc is have people talked about the relationship of that question to the question 
learning new languages i know that there has been at least some studies that say it really is harder 
learn languages iv yeah and part of that is because you do have this sensitive period in language learning 
the way that your brain processes language is different if than if it really learning a second language we 
it mapping on differently in the brain compared with in the brain the same is actually true for learning 
pitch interestingly a study that came out of japan that looked at kids who were between the ages of 
and and of them that finished this training protocol had absolute or perfect pitch sc so could you say 
perfect pitch is iv oh perfect pitch is where i sing any note and you can tell me sc 
flat iv exactly right yeah or like a bus rumbles by and you could tell me what note so 
pitch and in neuroscience parlance we call it absolute pitch because what does perfect mean right chuckle sc sure 
so these kids of them ended up getting absolute pitch and because the way that they process sound is 
and when in that sensitive period they can extract regularities differently than when they get older and they listen 
it differently as their auditory cortex matures so i think going to see some similarities in language why kids 
learn languages early necessarily speak with an accent because the way their brain processes that sound is different so 
some elements of that but music again so subjective like do you really want to be a perfect player 
a musician sc well better than being what i am laughter yeah all relative iv but you also have 
reason for why you want to play music right sc sure iv whereas like the playing piano is probably 
it because their parents told them to sc right and you make the point that you can even learn 
sing well more than most people think but i think most people probably think that there are good singers 
there and less good singers and you argue that more about training and practice and knowing what doing than 
people think iv yeah because we see the differences in the brains of singers as and song birds and 
species that have this unique ability to vocalize in many different ways we see the brain changes so you 
wire it up differently but that takes time and i think one of the things that is really hard 
that for a lot of people awkward singing is really embarrassing you know sc oh yeah right iv so 
so tied into this whole emotional thing that makes so if trying to sing and having such a big 
reaction your brain is going to be like first of all i want to do that again sc i 
to do that iv or going to be focusing on what are the aspects of the emotion not on 
content of the information that getting right so i think because our voices are such a reflection of who 
are as people it can be something hard to be objective and just say just going to keep training 
this until i get it sc but you can learn i remember an interview with lady gaga where the 
was asking about the fact that when she was young she was in a led zeppelin cover band laughter 
was belting out rock and roll and misty mountain hop and so they said that hurt your throat if 
sing that all night and like if you know how to chuckle iv right not if you know how 
do it exactly and so yeah when opera singers try to sing musical theater without knowing what doing they 
hurt themselves even though they have this apparently really great technique but musical theater singers who then turn around 
try to sing opera again they can hurt themselves but if but not if doing what been trained to 
sc can you pinpoint what the difference is between singing in musical theater and singing in opera iv yeah 
mean in a nutshell sort of belting so essentially where putting most of your timbre and remember in the 
theater largely amplified sc right iv so you have to project as much and so essentially the way that 
much pressure you put through your vocal cords and that is different right if you want sc okay iv 
it down to that you know the way you use your resonance and the way you control your breath 
going to be slightly different sc and what about the other way around we can learn music and the 
that music helps us learn the mozart effect and this was actually based on something scientific and then it 
a little bit out of control iv yeah i mean something scientific in the sense that it was literally 
onepage paper from chuckle from uc sc all it takes iv yeah of like thirty undergraduates what it was 
people the scientists had three conditions they had these undergraduates perform ultimately a bunch of the iq tests the 
like the spatial reasoning subtests where like a picture of a geometric shape here are some blocks make the 
look like the picture that kinda thing so they had three conditions the first condition was where they played 
sonata i believe for fifteen minutes before they were asked to do these tests or they sat in silence 
they listened to relaxation tapes now which of those three conditions do you think is more arousing sc music 
iv yes yes so they were probably slightly more sc yep iv slightly more engaged sc more engaged iv 
they performed better slightly on these tests if you had given them a shot of espresso or in subsequent 
of this kind of work reading a stephen king chapter was just as arousing blur was just as arousing 
yeah and using arousing just in the sense of heightened sense iv oh yes i mean just more awake 
sc right iv i mean sexually laughter sc right maybe that too but okay depending on the songs iv 
that i mean maybe right chuckle yeah but certainly in terms of just your general whether or not awake 
asleep your general arousal level of your brain sc yeah iv so yeah so that was the original mozart 
and that led into this whole baby einstein play music for your baby give them better iq which most 
it is totally not supported by the research but if you look at sort of musical training there is 
relationship between the extent of musical training and ultimately academic success if really what interested in or performance on 
tests which we all know are an imperfect measure of intelligence sc sure iv but what we see is 
kids who have three years or more of individual music lessons tend to show higher iqs or a higher 
achievement than kids who on average have that kind of exposure now got a compound here potentially of socioeconomic 
because on average kids that can afford to go to have music lessons are going to be on average 
than kids who but there are a couple of nice control studies like one study in particular out of 
public schools where they randomly assign kids to two groups one was an instrumental music group one was kind 
just group music classes and they did start seeing changes in the brain after only fifteen months of musical 
that map on to what we would have expected now they see changes in iq or changes in parts 
the brain that we think are really responsible for higher intelligence but because i think it just enough time 
yeah iv so i do sc practical limitations of the study get in the way at some point iv 
i mean i do think compelling if only studying music to make yourself smarter i think probably going to 
out eventually but i think music is something that is enjoyable and stretches you and puts you out of 
comfort zone and one of the great statistics that i love to quote is that it makes you more 
to go to school so in la for example there have been a number of studies of kids who 
at risk who are not expected to attend school very often if you put a school music program in 
likely to show sc interesting iv they want to play in the band they like it more fun to 
to school now you keep kids in school and off the streets less likely to commit crimes and end 
in juvie or ultimately in jail now you take one child and you turn them around so they end 
going to jail that pays for ten years of a music teacher salary right sc there you go yeah 
iv right so i think that in that sense it can make us all smarter because it can make 
school more enjoyable it can make us attend school more and ultimately help society sc but that learning an 
or being trained in music you said earlier if remembering correctly that being exposed to classical music when young 
affect you later in the sense it will make you more likely to appreciate classical music when iv yeah 
but saying it help you with any higher cognitive capacities but maybe being trained as a musician does iv 
exactly exactly and i know that listening to mozart growing up is going to make you smarter i think 
if you listen to mozart growing up you probably have a family that already sc they had a headstart 
iv yeah the heredity and yes put you there and i say that the actual listening to music is 
bigger factor than those other huge factors sc yeah and then the final section of your book which is 
about the social aspects of music i mean you make the point which is a good one but one 
had never thought about that most music is truly social unless you are all by yourself performing a piece 
music that you wrote yourself right laughter iv right right right sc other than that chuckle iv right and 
then you still you probably still have the idea that there is a listener maybe somewhere but yes i 
i was like truly trying to see is there any sc even if just a volleyball that they had 
on it chuckle iv right exactly sc yeah and that plays out in a million different ways i mean 
book is about how music makes the world better so how does music in this sort of social aspect 
us make the world better iv well i think in the most simplest way i think it engenders empathy 
think it allows us to put ourselves in someone shoes to experience someone humanity in a way that maybe 
have in another medium and therefore feel merciful towards them or feel connected to them and somehow understand them 
little bit better so if you think about the kind of it gives people an outlet like sometimes i 
about the turntable culture of the in new york this is where this was invented and it was invented 
people needed to get out of their homes they really love where they lived and they wanted to be 
together go out into the streets and have these dance parties and they just wanted to keep dancing and 
they created this two turntable technique where you can essentially keep the rhythm going it have to stop sc 
song end iv the song end right you can keep dancing forever right and so anyway and then you 
on to that spoken word and an outlet for people to express themselves and so forth and so all 
a sudden you can see that how this kind of genre of music evolved out of a sense of 
to engage with your community trying to make your own situation better sc and of course a flip side 
like we already said there are fight songs and fight songs can be good if just my sports team 
your sports team but also martial music and you can stir up the emotions of a populace using music 
right exactly and even in the book i mention bono who was my favorite artist growing up he was 
not wanting to sing sunday bloody sunday because he was worried it was going to incite more violence i 
this is like he was genuinely worried about this laughter sc well maybe not crazy iv yeah i think 
is right i think that there are times when you can exactly stir up emotions enough where they go 
and then they riot i mean you do the same thing with for some reason sports ball games right 
sc yeah iv i understand that either but i think part of i mean imagine a sports event without 
sc right iv right take all the chanting and music playing and all that out of it and do 
still have the same reaction i know sc well i mean it i presume that a longstanding relationship between 
a football game and having a marching band at halftime you know iv well yeah even the taunts and 
shouts and we will you know whatever or sc ole ole ole iv yeah yeah exactly yankees sucks sorry 
a yankees fan so i can say that chuckle sc and what the example i think of when this 
comes up are soundtracks for movies and tv right which which are really important and a little manipulative i 
like being manipulated iv oh totally manipulative yeah i mean imagine the psycho scene with like you know the 
on the bus laughter right and not scary at all laughter sc right right right i mean how much 
you studied the neuroscience of that are there people iv being more and more studied and fascinating now because 
we have it in certain places these kind of theaters that are built to study physiology while experiencing concerts 
films where you can look at galvanic skin response which is a measure of how sweaty your palms are 
breath rate respiration rate your heart rate etcetera so we can actually see we can track at least the 
of their emotions as looking at films or listening to concerts and so yeah essentially what you think we 
find which is that these things are very powerful and you can look at different aspects of music pacing 
types of instrumentation used etcetera that can dictate what kinds of expectations people will start to have right like 
have an ominous theme and what you see is a rowboat on a lake and foggy right sc you 
going to happen iv in the water but if it was a calm pleasant kind of like about to 
a spa day music then you think oh just calming sc because the brain wants to predict iv right 
and a very good clue for predicting things going to iv exactly sc yeah speaking of the neuroscience of 
forget about just sports or soundtracks do composers know about the neuroscience i mean i joked about led zeppelin 
is that a frontier where people are knowingly manipulating our nuclei laughter iv i mean sure there are but 
also think that in some ways this is an example of the knowing the neuroscience before the neuroscientists know 
neuroscience right like proust was a neuroscientist that idea right so yeah this is actually why i sort of 
the whole for cadence my podcast and for this book in particular too turned the idea on its head 
want to use science to reduce music and to take out all the mystery and wonder of it i 
to use music to help me understand the brain humanity much more interesting to me because i feel like 
and other artists have been studying these aspects of human behavior for so long that we can learn so 
from their observations of what is successful and what is not about ourselves and then those make we can 
publishable neuroscience research where you say look this thing that artists have known for one hundred iv i think 
important to actually look to artists so when people say how do you define music and my answer is 
favorite artist ask your favorite because they will have a much better idea of what it means to have 
an idea of what it means to create a good track versus a mediocre track because they know it 
than we do and so i think to me we the neuroscience can maybe add a little bit but 
importantly i think that the art can help direct the neuroscience sc i completely agree but just to be 
there i do think that sometimes people know it broadly construed but say it iv for sure for sure 
a whole another skillset iv exactly and for me it until i actually saw the activation maps of the 
nucleus and the nucleus accumbens that i understood what my singing teacher was saying to me for five years 
is not the high note that matters all the notes leading up to the high and i was like 
if i mess the high note not going to get but she was exactly right because if the high 
comes out of nowhere first of all technically really hard and not going to get as great a high 
and two the audiences expect it and they care about it it just sounds weird sc the journey not 
destination iv the journey and it until i literally saw this beautiful graph in a paper that showed how 
dopamine is tracked in the caudate first and then gives this shoot in the nucleus accumbens sc that might 
be you iv okay sc there might be other people using other methods we all get to the destination 
different ways so i guess just the final idea that i wanted to ask about is the future of 
brain one idea that been fascinated by is that we as a culture stopped individually producing music because we 
recordings instead we got records and we got radio and now we have cds we have cds anymore we 
to have cds now we iv just digital versions sc whatever they are itunes is the word i was 
for there but i get the impression that technology is making it more possible to create music in some 
ways iv yeah i think at a pivotal point and maybe everybody says that about every decade but i 
do feel like we are at a pivotal point i think that we are in danger of losing the 
musician which i think would be really tragic because i think we gain the most out of actually participating 
music making we see that from babies as early as six months and people as old as ninetyfive who 
alive in the nursing home when they get to make music iv but the other side of it is 
right that our lives are so busy we have time to devote hours to learning to play the violin 
we can create music with our computers and in these ways and easier than ever and maybe with technologies 
neuro stimulation even be able to enhance the ability to learn a new musical instrument i know still a 
question mark but i do think that we need to really be thoughtful about how we approach music making 
i think this is something happening all over in terms of content creation everywhere like you started your own 
sc yeah there you go iv there are lots of people who create videos on youtube and so you 
this seemingly endless amount of content that now is accessible to everyone and so curation becomes really important but 
i think that we can be participatory in terms of how we curate music maybe and maybe being a 
is exactly that curating sound and creating new sound out of it as opposed to creating your own sound 
of maybe some djs will get mad at me for that but not playing instruments in the same way 
but content creation comes in many forms and i think everyone thinks they can iv right sc anyone can 
a camera but i think that there is a barrier and maybe just mental maybe we should try to 
it to either performing or composing new music iv yeah again i think it depends on how you and 
society defines the musician and i think up until now kind of gotten too far down the line of 
need to be a professional musician otherwise you even bother and i think really unfortunate because i think in 
of human history that the case sc certainly in jane austen novels someone was playing the piano every night 
all the time it was part of your education and if you think about it like years ago or 
ago if you were going to make music it was around the fire presumably everybody was a part of 
and i think that if we lose that going to be harder to feel connected to each other in 
kind of small way sc i saw a software demonstration of this thing that would a computer program that 
help you write a song and it actually sort of came up with random things and you would pick 
ones that sounded good and it would mix them together in a pleasant way iv cool but then it 
to still be social sitting in your basement and creating music with a computer i think is just not 
as powerful or motivating as playing a garage band and i think that we have i think people are 
to realize that look adaptive as a species when things go to the pendulum swings too far in one 
we go somewhere else so in terms of how we use social media if making us sad going to 
using it in ways that makes us sad so if we really miss making music together going to stop
