to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll so how about those viruses so hot right now right talking 
viruses you know why in the midst of a quarantine global pandemic with the novel coronavirus leading to the 
but here at mindscape less about the concerns of the moment and more about the big picture issues that 
gonna last for a very long time sc so talk not about this particular pandemic but about the idea 
viruses more generally and probably no more expert person to talk to than guest david baltimore who won the 
prize in physiology and medicine for virusrelated activity back in the he his collaborators were the ones who showed 
called reverse transcription you might know that in genetics in cellular biology something called the that says that dna 
information rna goes over the dna and gets assembled in a way that can pick up that information and 
the rna carries it over to be converted into proteins the central dogma the dna stores the rna carries 
then proteins are constructed sc so reverse transcription as discovered by baltimore and others shows how rna can actually 
and affect the dna in fact it turns out that in viruses unlike in every other kind of informationcarrying 
i wanna say living organism because a debate about whether viruses are alive or not but just say that 
back and forth between dna and rna and proteins is extremely rich inside viruses and as baltimore went on 
show this has important implications for things like how viruses can cause cancer specific kinds of viruses like the 
virus and indeed right now when you talk about different kinds of viruses probably refer to the baltimore classification 
viruses which is named after david not after the city of baltimore sc so for most of this episode 
talk about what viruses are are they really alive how do they interact with organisms with genomes how do 
hop from one kind of organism to another but then we do at the end get a little bit 
specific about the current coronavirus and also about some bigger picture questions about gene editing about the origin of 
and i asked david a little bit about what he thinks about how coronavirus has impacted us and how 
should be responding to it let me just say that he has strong words for how been responding to 
and how we could do better not necessarily about social distancing and anything like that but how the public 
infrastructure should be ready for things like this in this day and age this should not be taking us 
surprise sc so this is one of those episodes of mindscape which is both very interesting but also very 
to things going on right now a rare thing usually not what we do around here but i think 
works in this case so go music sc david baltimore welcome to a mindscape podcast david baltimore thank you 
so i really wanna talk about viruses as a concept this is part of what i try to do 
at mindscape is to really dig into some of the details but be remiss to not mention the elephant 
the room having this conversation during a kind of quarantine for a pandemic because of a virus why we 
the appetite by putting this novel coronavirus into context is this virus that fighting against right now is it 
is it surprising is it the kind of thing that we should expect going forward db well i think 
virus is its own set of surprises viruses really only have in common that not cells they make their 
proteins they make their own energy so they have to be inside a cell in order to reproduce themselves 
a pretty minimal requirement and so there are lots and lots of ways that that requirement is met and 
and lots of different kinds of viruses the present virus that seeing never seen on this scale before and 
done a whole lot of work on that class of viruses previously we the scientific community so a lot 
coming as a surprise to us but the fact that a virus can be this surprising is itself not 
laughter sc i got that impression in my very brief reading up on viruses before this conversation oh my 
what a mess viruses are just much messier than the entire rest of life or even what we know 
life virus not even sure whether we should call it life db well always been comfortable calling viruses life 
they evolve they do everything that living systems do the only thing is they have to be inside a 
to reproduce sc maybe worth getting straight for people who are complete beginners here probably nobody is at this 
of the quarantine but i think a lot of people even know the differences between a virus and a 
little germs that make us sick db right certainly seen that a lot of people know the difference and 
are cells that are completely selfsufficient so if you give them nutrients like you put them on a piece 
fruit or another source of energy they can absorb that energy and grow multiply become many skillions of bacteria 
a virus do that a virus has to get inside a cell it could be a bacterial cell so 
are bacterial viruses but the ones that we care most about are viruses that affect humans and they affect 
by getting inside human cells skin cells gut cells lung cells all the various kinds of cells in the 
many of them support viruses sc right and so one of the ways in which viruses are not like 
parts of life no cell wall right no inside and outside to a virus db well there is an 
and an outside outside got a sort of rigid shell of some kind not always very rigid and inside 
has genetic material which is its secret the code to make more virus and that has to be liberated 
the shell and get inside the cell and act like the information but basically supplant the information so that 
cell now becomes a virusproducing factory sc so safe to say that viruses are parasitic on cellular life db 
viruses are parasitic on cellular life sc is there then some sense in which viruses could not have come 
they needed cells around already to come into existence db well if they were the kinds of viruses we 
today then that would certainly be true but we can imagine that there were other kinds of life forms 
might have degenerated into viruses but have been in an earlier stage of evolution more selfsufficient so a whole 
box problem here in what situation did viruses evolve and very hard to know the answer to that sc 
presume we look at fossils of ancient viruses db right we or we been able to sc i mean 
life we have this idea that we can find features of a last universal common ancestor because all cellular 
has certain genetic features in common but my impression is not true for viruses viruses sometimes just kinda spring 
without having a common origin db no all viruses have as their genetic material dna or rna and so 
are connected to the rest of the living world at a very fundamental level we use the same genetic 
viruses used the same genetic code as humans or any other species does and they are different than humans 
plants but they are not out of the blue sc okay so there might be a last universal common 
ancestor db but i think all viruses evolved from a universal precursor i think that there have been multiple 
of viruses that have a common ancestor and i say it that way because we actually know the answer 
the dna viruses and the rna viruses are really very different from one another the bacterial viruses particularly the 
that grow in marine bacteria or marine organisms are a very different set of critters than the ones that 
human disease for instance and some of the plant viruses are very different than most animal viruses so there 
some common ancestors but i suspect there are some really quite disparate evolutionary stories that have a common base 
you mentioned what i think is the most fascinating fact about the virus is that unlike cellular life which 
the biologist here correct me if wrong my impression is that all cellular life contains its genetic information in 
double strand of dna and it uses rna to make proteins the central dogma of biology but viruses are 
more haphazard some of them use dna some rna single strands double strands what have you db well i 
it haphazard i would call it inventive sc fair enough db viruses have managed to use genetic information in 
that higher cells sc i guess the usual thing that told is that rna is a little bit more 
than dna and therefore dna makes a better repository for genetic information do viruses manage to overcome that obstacle 
they overcome it largely by numbers so when you get infected and they make new viruses making literally billions 
new viruses so the fact that if they have an rna genome that it is more chemically fragile than 
is is overcome by numbers i think and not a big problem sc so if a few of viruses 
or reproduce accurately just make more the philosophy db yeah right right sc so a lot of viruses out 
and this is one of the things i read the number of different kinds of viruses could be an 
of magnitude larger than the number of kinds of species of all other life forms on earth and every 
contain many many individual virus particles so how do we even start to impose order on all of this 
to classify what kinds of different viruses there are db well virologists have enjoyed themselves by going into the 
world isolating viruses and then characterizing them in the electron microscope to get an idea what their structure is 
to get an idea of their metabolism and then naming them and so we have lots and lots of 
each with its own name sc but never gonna name them all right just too many different kinds db 
think fair that we will never name them all because basically every organism on earth every larger organism on 
has viruses and there are even some viruses that have viruses sc oh i did not know that chuckle 
yes it seems odd and actually a fairly recent discovery but a class of megaviruses which were discovered only 
the last couple of decades in oceans mostly and some of these megaviruses actually have parasitic viruses that grow 
them sc how big does qualify as in this case db well there are viruses that are literally bigger 
bacteria sc okay db so they have hundreds of genes i guess they have thousands of genes but they 
are parasitic they still have to grow inside a cell because they do the two things i mentioned they 
proteins they make energy but they actually have some genes that help them make proteins and they may even 
elements of energy production so getting fuzzier and fuzzier that line between viruses and all other organisms so i 
to be comfortable saying viruses were a separate kingdom but not so comfortable with that anymore sc well that 
also the impression i was getting in my reading that rather than fighting over whether or not viruses count 
living organisms maybe the lesson is that the boundary between living organisms and nonliving things is just not so 
i mean that a biosphere and viruses play an important role in it but they bounce back and forth 
cellular organisms db no i think there is a very fundamental difference between living organisms and nonliving sorry nonliving 
chuckle sc yeah chuckle db and viruses are living matter in the sense that they can reproduce they can 
and they are part of the dna rna world and not true of rocks and not true of water 
not true of a whole lot of other things which are nonliving they can change so evolving is an 
concept to try to think about but they have independent existence sc yeah so they have the information storage 
and reproduction passing down their information to subsequent generations but they have the engine all by themselves right in 
to take free energy from the outside world and get going and do things where they take advantage of 
cells they embed themselves in db right all organisms depend on the sun as the source of energy and 
viruses they get into the pipeline through being inside cells plants for instance sit out there in nature and 
up the rays of the sun directly and we eat plants sometimes we eat animals which have in fact 
plants sc so go into a little bit more detail about how the viruses affect the dna of the 
that they go into you mentioned it very very briefly but just a fascinating story in its richness the 
themselves can have dna or rna but like you say they make proteins they go in there and hijack 
maybe explain that a little bit more db well to make proteins requires something called a ribosome which is 
very complex little machine that can decode the genetic code from dna or rna actually from rna directly never 
dna and can read that code as three base segments of code that code for different amino acids being 
into proteins so proteins grow linearly and they grow one two three four five each a different amino acid 
multiple of the same amino acid and that whole process which has to be exquisitely accurate is something that 
simply have because they have ribosomes and so they have to find ribosomes sc so they go in there 
they just take advantage of the ribosome in the cell or my impression is sometimes change the dna or 
themselves into the dna or take pieces out of the dna of the actual cell living in db right 
are some times when viruses actually insert their own dna into the dna of the cell and actually how 
viruses work because they become part of the dna and now every time the cell divides it carries the 
along to the next generation so and if inside a say a chicken the chicken will grow a tumor 
is a whole lot of cells each one of which have these virusspecified sequences in them which cause the 
of specific proteins that now take over the cell sc but not the only thing they can do so 
are ways that viruses can go in there and just use the ribosome by themselves without messing with the 
of a cell db yes yes sc oh okay db most of the rna viruses for instance go into 
cytoplasm of the cell or the nucleus the two compartments of the cell and they just make more of 
and part of what they make is messenger rna that specifies particular proteins so those hop onto the existing 
and often what the virus does is to interfere with the messenger rna so that the messenger rna get 
ribosomes that frees up the ribosomes so that the virus can take full advantage of it this was something 
i worked out actually in my thesis sixty years ago sc is it necessarily a hostile takeover or it 
be just friendly coexistence db there are some that are friendly coexistence generally viruses that make much of themselves 
is make large numbers of progeny viruses that do make large numbers of progeny try to overwhelm the cell 
get rid of and the cell dies because the cell can no longer provide itself with what it needs 
i mean you made this wonderful distinction that it was really clarifying to me about equilibrium viruses versus nonequilibrium 
viruses that have settled into coexistence with their hosts and viruses that are kind of new and untamed and 
cause great damage db right and basically that if a virus is part of the ecosystem of an animal 
a human the virus evolves to be not too greedy so that it kill off its host and the 
or human evolves to fight against the virus to minimize the amount of virus that can be made and 
come into an equilibrium where the virus gets enough handle on cells to make some of itself but it 
for a whole lot if the virus is completely dedicated to this one species but if the virus is 
other species then it may when it gets into humans become voracious or become very meek because it evolved 
humans and those are the viruses that cause us trouble sc it makes sense that viruses would if parasitic 
their hosts they would evolve to be in some kind of relationship with them i mean when we find 
out there in the wild is it generally true that there is basically one or at least a small 
of species that happy being hosted by db yes in general in fact most viruses are pretty welldedicated to 
species and have come into equilibrium with that species of animal or plant or whatever and then it may 
a few others or it may not sc but these nonequilibrium things the bad guys are very often coming 
us human beings for example from other species that a case where you jump from one to the other 
exactly and so hiv is a virus that is native to monkeys it cause serious disease in monkeys but 
it jumps to higher apes like chimpanzees or jumps to humans then it causes havoc because it developed that 
vivendi sc yeah and are the viruses ever not just parasitic but symbiotic do they ever do something good 
their hosts db well not much now chuckle a sticky question one thing that viruses do is kill their 
and in the case of for instance the bacteria in the ocean what it does is to liberate the 
workings of the bacteria so the ocean is a rich soup because viruses are constantly killing off cells and 
them open now is it good for good for the oceans but is it really good for the bacteria 
think so sc good for the many but not good for the few i think yeah db something like 
right sc good for the ecosystem no but very interesting db oh good for the ecosystem yes and viruses 
a very important part of the overall ecosystem sc yeah i think when i said that the boundary between 
and nonliving might be fuzzy i guess what i was thinking of was that the boundary between an individual 
the ecosystem might be fuzzy because of the kinds of things that viruses do right even if we agree 
viruses are part of life with capital l they move from organism to organism i think i like what 
just said they serve a purpose to biology even if not to the individual db and that is the 
of the ecosystem a system with a lot of different moving parts sc you mentioned cancer very briefly i 
let that go by too quickly is cancer always caused by viruses or often or are we still investigating 
db well we are still investigating it but we think that the bulk of human cancer is not caused 
viruses sc okay db and although people are still hunting around seeing if things that missed but the common 
lung cancer breast cancer prostate cancer whatever really no evidence for a virus involvement now in head and neck 
there is a virus involvement in cervical cancer there is and in animals there are many more cases of 
cancer so most virusinduced cancers are actually studied in animals sc is cancer even a coherent category some failure 
the reproduction of individual cells but are there enough commonalities between different kinds of cancer that a sensible way 
thinking or is a viral cancer very different from a nonviral one db well if we go back in 
a little ways we know that viruses cause cancer and we thought that cancer was a disease that was 
to an organism in some way and when the first virusinduced cancers were discovered people who were sensitive enough 
numbers realized that viruses were so small that the only thing they could be causing cancer with is genes 
so we began to study cancers from the point of view of what genes the viruses had and we 
cancerinducing genes and then there was the amazing discovery of varmus and bishop that the cancerinducing genes and viruses 
were mutated cellular genes so it brought everything back it brought the cycle back and we realized that cancer 
induced by genes some are carried by viruses some are endogenous to the organism so we get mutations of 
that cause lung cancer or that cause breast cancer and no virus is involved but in other species breast 
is caused by viruses and even the same kinds of genes that are involved and so the viruses have 
up these genes and are carrying them along with them the history of modern day cancer research just sort 
done it all in one swoop sc yeah no that was great that was extremely clarifying so is it 
to say cancer is some kind of genetic failure and viruses are one way to induce that db yes 
good db i know about failure i mean from our point of view a failure chuckle sc yeah i 
gonna keep calling it a failure i know what you mean something changed but so i wanna get back 
too many interesting things to talk about here but i think that quite wrapped my brain around the ways 
which a virus and the dna of the host cell interact because i know that your big discovery for 
you won the nobel prize was a little footnote or a little emendation to the famous central dogma of 
maybe you could explain how that works db right so the central dogma which was enunciated by francis crick 
the maybe late was that dna is the repository of genetic information for higher cells for us and our 
that the way dna controls the cell how the information flows is first by copying the dna into rna 
then the rna working with ribosomes synthesizing specific sets of proteins and from the proteins all of life all 
the variety of life all of the variety of cells flows and so in the simplest form of a 
dna makes rna makes protein and that was the central dogma and crick says never meant to say that 
go back the other way from rna to what i said very strongly was flow from protein back to 
what howard temin and i showed in one thousand nine hundred seventy was that information could flow backwards from 
to dna and many people said we violated the central dogma we showed the central dogma was wrong but 
you believe francis crick and i believe francis crick he had already taken that into account sc so i 
i have two questions one is why is he so sure was he so sure that you go from 
to rna is there some structural barrier there db yes an enormous structural barrier because literally a code in 
that gets transferred into the structure of protein so to go back into the code would take a very 
machine you just go backwards in the protein synthetic machinery sc got it db he also crick also postulated 
not long after it was shown that there had to be an adapter that would adapt the code to 
reality of proteins and so he understood that there was a lot of complex machinery that gonna just reverse 
like saying if you wanted to take the plans for a house and make a house out of it 
back from the well it be so difficult that was a bad example laughter db but there must be 
better one sc the example i was gonna use because we just had scott aaronson on the podcast a 
complexity theorist easy to multiply two numbers to get a big number hard to factor a big number back 
its two factors db well alright actually a good way of looking at it sc but that kind of 
yeah seem to have an analog for going from rna to dna look i mean i know very little 
this but my feeling is that rna is kind of like just a looser more fragile version of dna 
structurally very similar db exactly true the difference between rna and dna is a couple of chemical bonds sc 
people have long hypothesized that rna came first and was exactly because a little bit less rigid maybe it 
easier to make the first time and then rna led both to proteins and dna in modern life are 
a fan of that rna world kind of theory db no i am a fan of the rna world 
i think very likely that rna came first but not so much because easier to make rna than dna 
because rna a rigid rod dna is this double helix that winds around itself and forms a long rod 
is generally just one strand and so wigglier and it can do more sc yeah okay db so actually 
dna looks like a dull molecule and rna looks much more interesting does many more things and easier to 
that the world had only rna than that the world had only dna sc dna is a good place 
secure information securely as it were to store it securely but rna is just more active and vibrant and 
there in the world doing things db while at the same time it can also store information just like 
can there are doublestrand dna sorry doublestrand rna viruses in which rna acts exactly like dna sc and i 
maybe i let you finish or where you got distracted from exactly how the central dogma got amended in 
way that would not offend francis crick how is it that viruses figure out how to go from rna 
dna db right well we know in an evolutionary sense how that came about but what we do know 
that a class of rna viruses that carry with them in the virus particle an enzyme that can copy 
into dna and what i showed and howard temin showed at the same time and for which we won 
nobel prize was that the virus actually had the enzyme in it and a virusspecified enzyme so picked up 
the previous replication cycle of the virus and it copies the rna into dna as the first thing it 
when it gets inside a cell and then that dna goes into the nucleus which is where we keep 
in our cells and it breaks open randomly more or less the structure of the dna and it literally 
itself end to end into the dna and now the cell inevitably for the rest of its life has 
new genetic information in it and insidious chuckle sc i mean it sounds little scary to think that going 
in our bodies that does sound bad that these little guys are messing with our dna db messing with 
dna and been doing it for a long time so something like of our dna originated as viruses carrying 
in ourselves all sorts of interesting little pieces of dna that have origins totally outside of ourselves sc so 
of evolution i think that a sort of high school version of evolution where the cells break in two 
then sexual reproduction occasionally a mutation but the story of viruses really makes me think that much more open 
that like the dna strands that mom and dad give us are not quite as sacrosanct as i was 
to believe in my high school biology class db right and we call this dna parasitic dna because taking 
of the properties of dna in order to propagate an organism or a piece of an organism which is 
virus sc hard well i should say it the other way around very tempting to anthropomorphize chuckle these tiny 
things richard dawkins famously wrote the selfish gene and not sure if you think a good metaphor but it 
there is a temptation to think that this competitioncooperation but a constant jostling inside our genomes between our genes 
the viruses that wanna tag along db yes there is all of that and it plays out over evolutionary 
so there are things in our genome that actually found their way into our genome in monkeys or in 
earlier organisms and have been carried along ever since then during the millions of years of evolution because it 
a very very long time to get rid of something once in your genome laughter sc but we still 
draw these pictures of the family trees of different species and families and genuses and so forth and that 
of picture is very compelling but it hides the idea that there are viruses or other things i know 
me where only viruses or there are other things that kind of insert dna that did not come from 
ancestors at all db no i think only viruses do that but yes we have ignored a source of 
information which follow the usual rules it comes in as an infectious source and it is very important sc 
this count as called horizontal gene transfer db yes it is horizontal gene transfer but what we generally mean 
we say horizontal gene transfer is that among bacteria dna from one bacterium can go to another bacterium and 
inserted and something that really happen as far as we know in humans or in higher organisms in multicellular 
so we never get little pieces of rabbit dna or little pieces of mouse dna whereas bacteria do they 
little pieces of dna from other bacteria sc well i guess if some viruses can insert their dna into 
and that can even be evolutionarily advantageous and we can pass it down do we ever insert bits of 
dna into viruses or do they ever swipe any from us db well yes they do particularly these megaviruses 
lots of dna from their host organisms and make it part of them most of the viruses that infect 
are pretty small and really have room to bring in new genes so pretty stable in terms of their 
complement so polio virus today looks just like polio virus did during earlier parts of the evolutionary tree sc 
the megaviruses infect other kinds of organisms how do they survive db they do they particularly infect something called 
a kind of amoeba that is plentiful in the ocean i think still a question although maybe things have 
that not aware of still a question whether these megaviruses also infect other things in the ocean or out 
the ocean i know the answer to that sc even if unlikely i like to imagine the possibility that 
virus could carry a little bit of gene from a rabbit to a human being chuckle i think something 
biologists should look into chuckle db well now sequencing the genomes of all sorts of species and so if 
was gonna happen on any reasonable scale we would see it sc ah okay are we looking db oh 
looking at the dna and whenever anybody sequences it they put it through computers that check whether the sequence 
ever been seen before sc okay alright chuckle db and so if there were little bits of rabbit dna 
there we would know it sc but okay good so if being more realistic rather than just hopeful not 
much horizontal gene transfer as just viruses being part of the ways in which different bits of dna are 
or inserted into individual species and that makes sense that would play a role in evolution db yes sc 
also true that the i state this as a statement i should ask it as a question is viral 
information more fragile and therefore does it mutate more easily than cellular dna information db no chemically no difference 
information cellular information exactly the same dna all the same chemical bonds the difference is that during the duplication 
the genome in cells we have devoted a lot of attention to the precision of that duplication and so 
probability of an error creeping in is very low and the reason that the number of mutations between me 
my daughter are very very small through the regions that inherited from me so that process is exquisitely precise 
viruses not so precise viruses first of all treasure speed rather than accuracy and so they wanna spend all 
time checking whether every bond is correct willing to accept some genetic change in fact they may want some 
change because they want to mutate and be able to adapt to new circumstances through mutation so viruses have 
the bar for precision much lower than we do than higher cells do sc yeah okay that makes sense 
and that difference is something like five orders of magnitude six orders of magnitude sc oh wow db forgotten 
sc so yeah okay that does make sense not quite sure we completely finished this wonderful story telling about 
reversal of the central dogma so at the end of the day we have reverse transcription is that the 
for it db yes it is sc and retroviruses are the viruses that do it is that chuckle am 
getting that correct db right they were named because they reverse the flow of information sc and hiv is 
retrovirus db it is sc okay and so when moving from admiring the ingenuity of these little guys to 
against them is it an entirely different game if we wanna battle against retroviruses versus i know pro viruses 
not quite sure what the opposite of a retrovirus is db all other viruses chuckle sc okay chuckle db 
yes we do fight against them in different ways and in particular the reverse transcriptase the enzyme that copies 
into dna is a target for drugs and very early on when after hiv was discovered we had on 
shelf drugs pharmaceutical companies had on the shelf drugs that could selectively attack reverse transcriptase and that was the 
that we had drugs to fight aids within about what five years of the discovery because they were on 
shelf these drugs that selectively it turned out inhibited this polymerase and then we made many more of them 
that one was so successful but it enough and been a huge successful story of chemical synthesis of inhibitors 
reverse transcriptase and some other proteins of the virus enabled us to control hiv and to control aids sc 
maybe if you could now to be clear for the nonexperts there are different ways of fighting against these 
so the drug treatments that talking about but also vaccines which are different things different beasts db right so 
vaccines are a way of stimulating our immune system so that it will fight against a virus and a 
different process than chemically interfering with the growth of a virus as you were saying so vaccines are a 
different beast yeah sc right the drugs that you mentioned are literally just chemicals that go in there and 
in the way is that correct db right but the vaccines are much subtler so what we do is 
make something that looks to the immune system like a virus but cause disease and then we give that 
people and people react to it by making antibodies against the virus because the immune system thinks seen a 
and then if we get a real virus infection the system is all set up and ready to go 
it reacts much faster than if it seen the surrogate virus the vaccine and it reacts so fast that 
we even know that a virus has entered our bodies and it gets rid of them and fine sc 
what is the trick in designing such a vaccine is it making sure that the right antibodies are created 
well yes but we were making vaccines before we knew about antibodies so jenner made the first vaccines or 
the first vaccines and that was cowpox injected into humans so that a human would think seen smallpox but 
fact seen something much less dangerous than smallpox but the immune system now was all prepared to fight off 
and that was very effective sc i guess what getting at is is our immune system always clever enough 
fight if been prepared or do we have to sort of prepare it in different ways are we teaching 
immune system what antibody to make or are we just spurring it to do something that it done by 
given enough time db well it would have done it by itself given enough time true but during that 
you could be godawful sick and might die and so time is of the essence sc so i guess 
not quite understanding is is our immune system more clever than we are in the sense that it knows 
to make an antibody that would fight this particular virus db well our immune system is part of us 
be smarter than we are chuckle sc smarter than our forebrains db but the immune system reacts to any 
protein by making antibodies that will bind to it and that foreign protein may be a virus or it 
be something else and the immune system is evolved as a very general way of recognizing foreign protein sequence 
if it sees foreign protein sequence it reacts to it so a very general capability sc when trying for 
to get a virus for a vaccine for the coronavirus what is the intellectual challenge there what are the 
that we have to solve to make that happen db so in principle all we should have to do 
to make a preparation of the coronavirus inactivate its ability to multiply which we can do chemically and then 
that and the protein should act as what we call an immunogen to stimulate the immune system to make 
and some vaccines are as simple as that just killed virus the salk vaccine famously was killed polio virus 
that always work sometimes in the process of killing the virus you also kill the ability to stimulate an 
response lots of things can go wrong along the way so the chinese actually have made a vaccine that 
and trying to prove that that vaccine will actually protect people and see it showed that it would protect 
but you could also just take the spike from the surface of the virus which is a protein and 
that and much simpler so you can make that totally synthetically cheaper to make you can control the manufacture 
and so something that many companies and labs are focusing on right now as a way of inducing antibodies 
see if it works but the problem is it always work got lots of history of failed attempts to 
this with other viruses and more insidiously sometimes it makes the infection worse rather than better it actually helps 
virus get into cells sc yeah okay db and so you want that so you gotta be sure that 
vaccine do that and part of proving that your vaccine is safe sc but yeah correct me if wrong 
still have a vaccine for something like hiv right or the common cold for that matter no guarantee we 
sort of solve this problem on a short time scale db yes but the reasons that we have a 
against hiv are idiosyncratic to hiv for reasons that not gonna try to explain sc okay chuckle db but 
fascinating story about how hiv has evolved to avoid the immune system and so when trying to make a 
trying to do something which never happens naturally and still trying to make that happen the common cold is 
different story so the common cold is more than one kind of virus there are viruses from different species 
viruses that all cause more or less the same symptoms which is what we call a common cold many 
them are of a class of viruses called rhinoviruses being for the nose and they all cause sniffles and 
and whatever but there are literally hundreds of them just in humans there are coronaviruses that cause a common 
there are adenoviruses that cause the common cold so there are dna viruses there are rna viruses so the 
cold is not something that we can make a vaccine against because has so much variety sc okay that 
makes sense so therefore saying that maybe i should not be quite so pessimistic about coronavirus the coronavirus the 
one that currently fighting against are you optimistic that we will get a vaccine at some point db i 
optimistic now that mean gonna get a vaccine it only means that optimistic and sort of an optimist but 
looks to me like this is a pretty ordinary virus and against most ordinary viruses we have been able 
make vaccines so we have vaccines against measles mumps chickenpox never mind things like smallpox and polio and so 
confident that they will find a way to make a vaccine within the next couple of years sc okay 
what do we do if say it takes two years are there prospects for treatments that will let us 
back to something like normal in the meantime or are we gonna have to maintain quasilockdown indefinitely until a 
comes along db i see us making a chemical inhibitor a drug against in any less than a couple 
years so the same sort of problem we could be lucky and people are trying very hard to be 
and to find a drug which we already know is safe and we use for something but also will 
the coronavirus and we hope that that something exists but no actual reason why it should may remember viruses 
their own evolutionary history and so their proteins look anything like our ordinary proteins the proteins of our body 
makes them terrific targets for the immune system because they are so different but it makes them very unlikely 
do the same things as our cells do and so we likely have made drugs against them sc so 
in favor of being lucky but i think that also important to at least conceptualize the pessimistic scenario and 
what i hear you saying is at least something we should be prepared for the idea that we get 
medicine for this for the next two years and we have to combat it in more primitive i guess 
db so let me get on my high horse for a minute sc please why here chuckle db we 
to have in our armamentarium drugs that will inhibit the growth of coronaviruses all coronaviruses are related to each 
they all do basically the same set of things i would think that the pharmaceutical industry given enough time 
money could make drugs against coronavirus and they have to know which coronavirus it was in order to have 
molecules but we never spent any time trying to do that we never gave the natural world credit for 
it could produce that would cause a human pandemic and we should do that and we should dedicate ourselves 
even though late for this for for and twentyone and not too late and we should be now dedicating 
to never be caught like this again sc dare i ask are we dedicating ourselves to that db not 
seen sc yeah okay chuckle db as long as we depend on the profit motive not going to because 
motive know which one is worth making sc yeah okay okay but we do have research labs government research 
and universities that are not completely profit db right sc right so some prospect that be able db we 
to find a way to fund them to incentivize them to make we gotta put up prizes whatever it 
sc yup okay good as an action item db and not just coronaviruses the same thing is true for 
whole range of other viruses sc well this is one of the questions i wanted to sort of start 
up with what does the future of pandemics look like to you is this just the shape of things 
come or is this a weird outlier i mean in some sense the fatality rate is around and asymptomatic 
a couple of weeks but if a virus that is asymptomatic for a month and has a fatality rate 
then we are in trouble right db right i think most people feel epidemiologists feel that this is not 
outlier that we expected this we were given warning with sars and mers that coronaviruses had the ability to 
in new forms that we were not aware of were out there in the world we should go in 
characterize every virus in a bat because bats seemed to be a very effective reservoir for viruses that can 
into humans but not just bats the whole natural world has viruses that we have to worry about and 
we ought to be cataloguing them we ought to be doling out to individual companies the responsibility to make 
that we can inhibit them we should take all this seriously now will we i know chuckle db and 
know because this has been known for years this is public health and the history of public health is 
when something stops being an eminent problem that we lose our focus on it and we start using our 
for other things and this ought to be the lesson of lessons that we do that we have to 
our eye on the ball and the ball is that whole world of potential viruses sc right i will 
this as on the optimistic side of the ledger because as many as our public health failures have been 
saying is realistic we could do it just up to us not like a super bowl scientific problem here 
a matter of willpower right db right oh and money chuckle sc and willpower and money and political will 
right and probably for dramatic tension reasons we should end there but not gonna let you go yet i 
you here going to give you two lightning round questions db okay sc one is been active at least 
out on the idea of gene editing and human gene editing we talked about it during this podcast but 
a big deal for science biology humanity right now how should the people out there be thinking about the 
and the dangers of gene editing in your view db i think if going to use the strength that 
editing gives us to modify human heredity the place where it seems to me all good and no bad 
with certain kinds of diseases that are in our genome and that are inherited in families and that if 
could get into those families into their genes and modify them so that they pass disease they pass sickle 
anaemia they pass the many other thousands literally of diseases that we now pass around among humans that that 
be a good thing for the human race sc right db now there are some arguments about it and 
them but gonna ignore them at least for this conversation the problem is that if we do that do 
open a box and provide the opportunity to not change genes that are bad but to change genes that 
cosmetically less than exactly what we would want so some people would like to have children who are very 
now i know what very intelligent means and i know how you measure it and there are a whole 
of problems with it but if we knew that it was attached to specific genes you could say wanna 
that gene into my inheritance i want my children to have or a gene for height or a gene 
there are some things that are at the borderline for instance obesity is something which we can control but 
also has a genetic component and other things so i know not simple to make that distinction db but 
it were simple to make the distinction then have to say we control what this technology is used for 
that used for the right things and not the wrong a huge challenge to the modern world because we 
the international law the international treaties so that everybody in the world will behave in a common way and 
means that if you get it done in the united states you might be able to get it done 
else and so we are now wrestling with these issues the issues of where are the lines to be 
what do we want to allow what we want to allow how are we gonna make common cause across 
world and i realized that this was going to happen about oh six or eight years ago when the 
intimations of this technology became known and i said we had to prepare the world to think about these 
db and so i helped organize now two meetings one in washington one in hong kong that brought together 
from around the world to begin to think about this i think that we were gonna generate answers and 
but i think we did generate consciousness we did generate concern and there will be another such meeting in 
year or two as soon as we can have meetings again and chuckle so far there has been only 
attempt to do this in humans it was a sort of badly designed attempt by a chinese scientist who 
been appropriately stripped of his academic positions in china and i hope we keep talking and we see any 
attempts to put it into practice but i feel that it is a technology which can benefit our species 
that we ought to find a way to get the good and to control the use of it in 
that are less appropriate sc good very useful and i could follow up obviously but your time is valuable 
i will ask you one more lightning round question i was slightly surprised when i read an interview with 
from a few years ago it contained the following quote from you most interesting outstanding biological question is the 
of not gonna argue with that but that seems interesting coming from a virologist do you still believe that 
true db i do still believe true and we made much of a dent in it although we made 
little dent in it but why it comes from a virologist is because i have another side to my 
which is that i love institutions i honor what institutions do and i have been willing to give over 
of my time and energy to running institutions and so i was president of the rockefeller university i was 
of caltech and i have been involved in a whole variety of things that relate to the infrastructure of 
rather than the doing of experimental science and that means that i have had an opportunity to look at 
widest range of science and to think about what are the real challenges in science and what does it 
to build institutions that can meet those challenges db and i came to the conclusion that neuroscience was the 
and that we have in spite of working on neuroscience problems for many generations now we still have a 
way to go to understand how the brain works and how it controls our behavior and that within that 
most enigmatic piece of it is consciousness how do got consciousness of the room in front of me of 
in front of me i can tell you all about it but how do i do it how do 
make the images out of biology out of neurons that seems like such a jump the jump from dna 
protein was an amazing one the jump from neurons to consciousness is i think orders of magnitude more challenging 
think about sc i think a great place to end david baltimore thanks so much for being on the 
podcast db okay my pleasure music the best metaphoranalogy why proteins cannot go backwards and coderecode rna would be 
plants that utilize robotic construction for simplicity i will use the example of a robotic arm this robotic arm 
construct something again for simplicity even though it occur in actual manufacturing plants i am going to say that 
one robotic arm completely manufactures on its own the entire product i will use the example of a toy 
machine code is written to program the robotic arm this robotic arm is provided with material with the combination 
the machine code and the material the robotic arm can construct a doll the machine code in this example 
be equivalent to the rna because both are the instructions the computer reads the machine code and the ribosomes 
be equivalent to the computer because they read the rna the robotic arm in this example which constructs the 
would be equivalent to trna which constructs the protein the doll in this example would be equivalent to the 
both of which being the end product for this example the material given to the robotic arm to construct 
toy doll would be equivalent to the food that animals eat if you purchased or were given the toy 
the question becomes could you write the machine code necessary to make the doll without disassembling it the answer 
for an expert computer programmer is no it that it could never be possible for a biological organism to 
transcribe a protein into rna but it would be very difficult to do so the protein would have to 
be disassembled into its components parts these component parts would have to be read individually and so on and 
forth a very similar process would be required to go from fully formed toy doll to writing the machine 
necessary to build the exact toy doll with a robotic arm ps i know plants manufacture proteins as well 
animals but the way they get the material to do so would require another entire explanation as well as
