of my favorite things to do in paris is to visit the catacombs underneath the city itself these are 
extraordinary collection of tunnels that are about twenty meters underground the height of a fivestory building and there are 
of course of people sneaking into sealedoff areas to throw massive parties and so forth but some of the 
are explicitly open to the public you walk down a rickety spiral staircase and you find yourself surrounded by 
this part of the catacombs are used as a storage place for the skeletal remains of literally millions of 
from the back then the art of the cemetery was not quite as advanced as it is today and 
were just piling up sc there are stories of a heavy rainfall washing bodily remains down the streets of 
itself so at some point they gathered up literally millions of remains and put them underground in these catacombs 
site that if you visit it will leave a real impression an impression of your mortality but also an 
of the different ways in which different cultures think about mortality to me as an american going to the 
makes me realize that not necessary to have sort of the ponderous somber attitude toward death that we have 
in the us deep in the catacombs there are little snippets of poetry on the walls there sometimes the 
are arranged in little heart shapes and so forth a slightly more accepting almost whimsical version of how we 
about death and we know that different cultures think about death very differently sc in mexico the day of 
dead dia de muertos which celebrates and honors the ends of our lives in the united states we do 
we celebrate we honor death certainly not whimsical about it we treat it with utmost seriousness and if anything 
try to ignore the impending death that all going to face as much as we can this attitude can 
a deleterious impact on one of the most singular moments of a human life the moment that it ends 
we want to think about death we should be asking ourselves is it that we want to die how 
we want it to happen if we could possibly have any control over that how can we plan for 
so recently a movement has emerged known as death positivity a movement that works to create a more healthy 
attitude toward the inevitability of death and to celebrate death as a capstone to a life well lived to 
the cultural and artistic aspects of death taken a little bit more seriously so guest is megan rosenbloom a 
librarian who is a leader in this deathpositive movement megan is an associate director for instruction services at the 
norris medical library and also the author of a forthcoming book dark archives hear what that book is actually 
later in the podcast also the cofounder and director of the death salon the official event of the order 
the good death an organization devoted to exploring ways to prepare a deathphobic culture for our inevitable mortality gonna 
to all of us eventually so go music sc okay megan rosenbloom welcome to the mindscape podcast megan rosenbloom 
sc so a librarian but a medical librarian how what kind of weird career trajectory ends up with one 
a medical librarian in particular mr well some people just set out to be a medical librarian you can 
medical library classes in library school so baseline in order to be an actual librarian and not just work 
a library you need a masters in library science a lot of people just think that you sit and 
books all day or check out books all day i wish but it is one of those rare degrees 
one of those rare positions that you actually need a masters not a phd specifically a masters so some 
when getting their masters they take specific courses or tracks in medical librarianship i do that i kind of 
up in a medical library in a sort of backward fashion mr some people are physicians and then decide 
wanna be librarians and then they go to library school and then use their medical expertise my first job 
libraries which is still at the same place i am but this is my third position there now was 
of metadata and content so it was more about the publishing stuff and all like describing the resources and 
them work and making people be able to get them so it it matter if i had much medical 
although while i was getting my degree i was working in medical publishing so i did have some very 
understanding of medicine but not like a medical professional but i am now a medical information professional i know 
about the information but you want me to perform any surgery on you or anything like that sc and 
your special interest in the subject of death come before you became a medical librarian or did that grow 
of that mr yeah i think i always had gothish tendencies but really kind of recognize it but then 
terms of professional interest and learning about different cultures and history and that kind of thing and getting involved 
this whole deathpositive community i actually came to it from history of medicine and i came to history of 
from rare books sc oh okay mr so my first love in libraries was the rare books and while 
was in philadelphia i was working in a publishing company but while i was getting my degree i i 
a couple of places and one of them was the aids library which i was i was cataloging some 
their archive material around the very early days of the aids epidemic which was completely heart wrenching but kind 
showed me the importance of that kind of material and then i was a docent at the rosenbach museum 
philadelphia a lot of people know about that place but it is a basically a rare book museum dr 
was the rare book seller to the stars he built all the main rare book collections in the country 
the huntington he was one of his main sellers sc right mr henry main seller was dr rosenbach you 
that kind of guy and so he has some of the craziest rare books in this house in philadelphia 
i would give tours of that so he has just off the top of my head the actual manuscript 
james ulysses like the handwritten one not in ireland in philadelphia laughter mr got all the notes and everything 
bram dracula got the only known existent copy of poor almanack the first one the just a taste i 
pretty incredible sc something about growing up on the east coast and in philadelphia in particular where near where 
grew up all these crazy historical things that here in la a little bit harder to find but all 
collections handed down through the centuries mr there are a lot in la too but yeah a little harder 
find in philadelphia the history is sort of just right in your face laughter mr and before i was 
librarian i was a journalist so i just felt like i knew everything about the city i knew all 
nooks and crannies and fun things there was to be had because it was kind of a small place 
but the history yeah and so the history and the rare books were the thing that really got me 
and then i wanted to come to la and so i just kind of found what turned out to 
a really lucky break of a job in a medical library and when i got there during the interview 
this is a hard part of the interview where we ask you all the hard and it was in 
rare book room and like i got this no laughter mr so no one at the library really cared 
rare books and for a long time so this collection but no one was really doing anything with it 
i kinda took it upon myself to start learning about them teaching with them and that kind of thing 
during the course of that was when i sort of got interested in the way that the corpse and 
cadavers were used in the history of medicine and most specifically the way they were sourced like where did 
bodies come from sc right mr because usually not a way that we would find very consensual or ethicallyokay 
sc yeah mr and so that was kind of my first interest in dead bodies i guess i came 
it from this completely other way but i was doing some public lectures about things sourcing bodies for anatomical 
and that was when caitlin doughty saw me do a talk and was kind of like she looks i 
it was kind of laughter mr it so much knows everything about but an organized librarian sc could be 
mr yeah sc and caitlin doughty is the founder or in some sense of this deathpositive movement mr yeah 
at least locally mr yeah she coined the phrase she is the alpha and omega and so she had 
this group before called the order of the good death which was this online collective of academics and artists 
writers and morticians and various death professionals that were doing interesting things like new ground breaking things talking about 
in a new way kind of changing the landscape of what was deemed acceptable to do or not do 
terms of bring back the home funeral bring back the green burial do that kind of thing so she 
kind built this collective and then she added some new people to the collective after i met her including 
and i felt like so unqualified for there was this list of people just doing incredible work and we 
on this sort of email thread like be cool if we could just get together for like a party 
or it was literally that sc it gave you a purpose mr it was like what if we got 
for a that would be impossible some of the people were in australia and stuff like that but then 
people were like you know if it was a kind of like a conference i might be able to 
permission to go if i was doing a talk at a thing or and i was like you know 
just planned my wedding in los angeles so i actually know some things about venues and that kind of 
then i just kind of ended up organizing with the help of other people and stuff we organized this 
we called it so salon like the century kind sc makes us think in france and yeah mr yes 
get a bunch of thinkers together and see what kind of feel and it was it was kind of 
only there were only like thirty people and then we did one public event at a bar venue like 
place where you would see music and we got there and there was three hundred people there and we 
like laughter and then the atlantic did a big feature on us and then it just kind of blew 
and the next thing we know in london and in san it just really snowballed very quickly and so 
salon is sort of the physical event now annual we did a couple a year at one point and 
it got to be too much so it was once a year now we go to some city and 
take over for a weekend and we have dozens of lectures and different kinds of artistic performances and workshops 
parties and so the one coming up in the fall in mount auburn cemetery in boston so sc walked 
there many times mr right so we are actually in a cemetery this time and they have these great 
and giving talks in the chapel but having on thursday we have one small group just all day hands 
home funeral workshop so thursday and then friday is kind of an open field day where gonna have people 
talks all over the cemetery and dance performances and all sorts of things that you can just stumble into 
including guided tours of the history of mount auburn it has incredibly sc that history again yeah mr probably 
most important historical cemetery in the country started that idea of the field cemetery the place you would walk 
and have picnics and things that was the first iteration of that and then friday night in one of 
chapels having this edward gorey sc mr fundraiser from the cape and we have the edward gorey houses like 
with artifacts and so be really fun and then saturday and sunday just talks all day sc this sounds 
but let me back up a little bit because just the phrase we wanna get straight what exactly is 
supposed to mean not in favor of dying right not like saying that is good all right but more 
correct me if wrong gonna die accept it not feel squeamish about it talk about it and try to 
it as meaningful and pleasant as is that about right mr right so we take the phrase it kind 
some people sort of that and it is provocative on purpose but the background of it is more like 
positive or body positive right so thing that we feel really uncomfortable talking about open up conversations explore the 
that this is dealt with in different cultures and time periods and different communities and what are some issues 
just about as intersectional as you can possibly imagine every slice and dice of possibility explore that see crosstime 
talk about all these things and what can we learn from that so sort when you open up conversation 
it destigmatizes it a little bit and then you can start an easy way intellectually if you start intellectually 
an easier way to get into the personal and that kind dealing with a topic that you really wanna 
with we live in this society really in death denial mr we just pretend never gonna happen to us 
then when it does when it comes into our lives because of a family member or something with us 
an emergency we know how to deal with it and then you just do what you think is the 
option the ten thousand dollars funeral with the embalmed body and the casket with the viewing and the concrete 
in the ground sc right mr it turns out not only are those things not the only option actually 
specific to our time and place and not even the way we did things one hundred years ago yet 
some reason we have this myopia where just this one thing actually you have a lot of options because 
people think that illegal not to embalm a body some funeral professionals tell people that and so this is 
ourselves at a time not at the time of need engage with things on a level how can you 
be intrigued about this great mystery that we all end up dealing with how is that not interesting and 
easy gateway into more difficult conversations or lines of thought sc and is it fair to say that it 
our specific time and place the united states in the beginning of century here that is more in denial 
average i did find this wonderful quote from one of your colleagues joanna ebenstein in the united she said 
of death absent from art and daily plenty of stories if a tourist in europe you go in paris 
in italy to the catacombs and all these skulls and bones all over the place and mexico of course 
the day of the dead very famously are we weird that way is it worse here then anywhere else 
yeah there may be some other places where just as bad but it is really noticeably bad here yeah 
the historical trajectory with that is the civil war really kind of took the civil war and its aftermath 
a thing that separated us from european heritage in terms of the way that we deal with death right 
that more or less doing the same thing it that different but then with the civil war it was 
first time that people were dying far away from home sc oh okay mr so normally before the civil 
you usually you were born at home you got sick at home you were taken care of at home 
died at home were laid out at home buried on the homestead buried at the local church yard your 
would take care of your body there was no funeral professionals there was no undertakers or anything sc and 
what it was like in europe at the time mr yeah that was pretty much just the way that 
went usually you probably have as much land in europe so it was pretty much the church yard but 
or less the same and then for the first time got a lot of people dying all at once 
the amount of people the amount of soldiers that died in civil war is more than any other american 
all put together and just the soldiers not even all the civilians like the entire city of philadelphia like 
now if everybody in philly died that is kind of comparable like that level of death in just a 
years and and for the first time normally if you if fighting a war fighting in your local area 
battle down the street and sc a militia that would be gathered mr right exactly this time people were 
really far away and dying and then their bodies were just left on battlefields and things like that so 
you had some means there were a couple of new technologies that made it so that you could bring 
home and one is the train but in order to get on the train you needed to do something 
stabilize the body so it you just have a rotting corpse on a train so these battlefield surgeons started 
embalming and that was really the thing like we can stabilize this body enough to get it home for 
proper then they took body on a train tour around the us and just embalmed him and embalmed him 
embalmed him and so people were seeing this lifelike corpse of the president and that kind of thing and 
over time not right away but over time then embalming became the normal thing to do embalming never really 
on in other countries people routinely do it so such a part of sc so even mr even now 
in europe what about latin america mr not really no mexico really do it just like some people do 
not the default sc was it originally a prestige thing were the richest families embalming they could afford it 
i think in order you would have to have some money in order to be able to get someone 
go find your son and then perform the service and then get them on a train all those things 
probably cost a lot of money yeah sc right mr and then yeah i mean we used to have 
room in our house called the parlor nobody calls it that anymore really oldfashioned but then we took these 
who were doing funeral service like well you embalm because full of nasty chemicals you need a professional to 
this you let the women do it at home you need a professional that you and so instead of 
a body in a parlor in your house you take it to the funeral parlor and then the parlor 
a living room because for the living and not for your dead bodies sc wow mr so over time 
little bits and pieces just add up to this completely different way of doing it and then here in 
angeles and a perfect example of this sort forest lawn is kind of the epitome of the death denial 
because the tombstones stand up because then gonna look like a cemetery they all have to be flat mr 
you can almost sc just the landscape yeah mr that a bunch of bodies just a big rolling hills 
where they bury their children is called slumberland really kind of disturbing with the euphemisms and all the things 
they do to try to sanitize away and graves and cemeteries in the united states modern graves they have 
huge concrete vaults in the ground so not just a casket in the ground a casket inside a concrete 
in the ground so ecologically pretty wasteful that they do that partially so that easy to mow the grass 
no settling sc it remains level mr yeah sc yeah mr so these are all things where if you 
somebody even in the european country like yeah we have these huge plots of land that would be worth 
of dollars in any other country and just for dead people for you get your grave forever which is 
a common thing either sc right in europe and south america i know that you get your grave for 
little while at some point cleaned out and someone else gets that place mr right because land is a 
and it used to be so much here we we were very land rich not really the case anymore 
it was for a long time so you get this real estate forever we put a bunch of expensive 
concrete metals and heavy metals and things in the ground with your body and we try to preserve a 
body as long as possible so that it looks like alive it is so weird like are you so 
people say things about other and caitlin latest book here to she goes around to a lot of different 
and talks about their death practices from a really respectful light that idea could sound horrible like lady goes 
but the way she does it is really well informed and is really sensitive but when talking about this 
in indonesia where the village digs up their relatives every year changes their clothes takes them around and shows 
corpses like the new the new the new people are like disgusting so like sc a different way yeah 
this is not an embalmed corpse this is a decomposing corpse that has been in the ground for a 
mr yes like a mummy dry they kind of look mummified but it is no mistaking the dead body 
is very dead and that act is done with utmost love and respect meanwhile if you told someone in 
village what we do they would be horrified so so about where from and your time in place but 
you start learning about other ways of doing things you realize just how weird we really are and that 
if not comfortable with the whole embalming thing maybe i have to do sc tell me more about what 
was like before we invented this new way of doing it so you would have not only had a 
at home in some sense but you would have died at home probably right the idea of dying in 
is also a relatively modern invention mr it is yeah clinical medicine sort of became a thing in right 
the french revolution time before that the hospitals were like charity hospitals so if you have a family so 
church will run this place for you to go die in basically and then during the french revolution they 
kind of like we have a lot of quack doctors who are saying a lot crazy things but what 
we used this group of poor people to train doctors on real people instead of just being like an 
on someone you can kinda learn but with a lot of people not just like one or two people 
that you have to pass tests and things in order to be a and that was sort of the 
and so that idea is called the paris school like when medicine was really getting codified as a profession 
professionalized yeah mr yes as a professionalized thing but still for most people that even relevant because you if 
were rich you could have a doctor come to your house to help you out but you would still 
at home for sure it would be scandalous to die in a hospital if you had money that would 
just unbelievable and so it was really the hospital stayed for the poor for quite a long time into 
century for sure and yeah so yeah you would be taken care of at home die at home often 
at home the funeral would be at home you they just would wash the body you might have some 
out that kind of thing sc and the family would wash the body not some trained professionals mr yes 
some stranger so now this whole idea of you dying in the hospital after a prolonged illness your body 
directly from hospital to funeral home and potentially from hospital or funeral home to crematory and you come back 
a box of ashes without any of your family necessarily being with you during all that process it can 
very destabilizing for people you know that one minute right here and the next minute in a box on 
shelf really hard for people to process so a lot of the appeal of something like a home funeral 
taking care of this family member and while doing it understanding the transition between them being alive and them 
a corpse sc so is part of the death positive movement to encourage home funerals or is there a 
of different possible ways to go and you just want people to be more cognizant of their choices mr 
think yeah did you know you have this option and you can be as involved or not involved as 
want this is not illegal to keep a body in your house people have this idea of where the 
somebody dies my god we have to call this is an they have to leave immediately and you do 
like maybe i wanna brush hair and make her look nice or whatever this sort of reaction because so 
used to being around dead bodies where we used to be around them all the time that like my 
what do we do an but then if you actually knew you could do things like that or if 
knew you could do a witness cremation you can go to the crematory and you can push the button 
you can be there with your family member for the last time that was something that was mentioned in 
book and she got so many responses like had no idea that i could have done that i wish 
could have done that now i so little information people share those things and people in the industry think 
want mr that was seen as like chinese thing chinese do it nobody else does or whatever and then 
people to be like i could have done that so the death positive movement there are certain things that 
up a lot like home funerals and green burial and stuff like that but those things for everybody and 
we pass judgement on people if they want the whole big embalmed everything more there are other options and 
support your ability to sc and presumably an issue also because a lot of people who will die are 
already sick right and maybe elderly and our culture makes a choice to sort of do everything we can 
eke every last minute of life out of people is there a relationship between the death positive movement and 
of life care and end of life choices and death with dignity and so forth mr oh absolutely yeah 
were helpful with getting death with dignity legalized in california sc why you explain exactly what that entails mr 
death with dignity been called a lot of things over the years and a lot of people like using 
like euthanasia that gives you this really bad association with nazis and that no one wants to associate with 
and then i forget what the other one people were using a little different but there are certain phrases 
that go in and out of vogue but the one right sc all the cultural baggage around the whole 
itself mr yeah so right now what people generally call it is death with dignity oh assisted suicide the 
that was a thing people call it that anymore because suicide has this big stigma people have big association 
it and if one hundred one and you have been suffering with liver failure for like many months are 
really committing suicide is that really what doing well even the word commit we use commit anymore because a 
you commit a crime right so that kind the words you use are really important and they change over 
but anyway my little hobbyhorse about that but death with dignity is when you when you get a terminal 
and they say you have something like six months to live this specific thing then you can choose to 
your doctor and you have to go through many different hurdles in order to get this so not like 
just wanna do not like that the doctor administer the medicine because against that no kind of thing sc 
oath sure mr right and so like they do that you can selfadminister drugs sc you have to do 
yourself mr right and you have to meet certain cognitive criteria for you to be able to do that 
if you have or dementia you have the option of doing that which is sad but understandable like why 
if not of sound mind in some way that you the important thing is they have to be sure 
not under duress in any way that someone in your life trying to force you into it that your 
and you are informed and then after many visits and all sc bureaucratic hurdles of various mr absolutely it 
it is a long process then you are given the drugs to then use or not for some people 
having it is so relieving like if it gets too bad i have an option sc right a little 
of volition a little bit of selfdetermination is there mr yeah like if this gets as bad as it 
could i have the ability to do something about and that is comforting to people in the end of 
lives yeah some people make use of it and some people and if you know coming if you know 
have a terminal diagnosis and you feel like at some point of your choosing that this is a good 
for you to do that you call your family over you have a big party you do whatever you 
do and then you have this option then what it is death with dignity because dignity part is gonna 
the way i do this and then gonna do it in a safe comfortable sc and this is the 
in california now and how many places mr yes so trying not sure exactly how many states legal in 
now but oregon was one of the first i believe in washington in california although there was a recent 
to it but i think it was overturned and i think things are okay right now it was very 
kind of challenge to that it was a handful of states not everybody sc do we have any idea 
how often people are taking the option and actually doing it mr i know not sure what kind of 
people are keeping on that but death with dignity is a thing that falls within death positivity because about 
sc right mr right like this you have an option you have choice you have some agency in the 
of your life we have a lot of people involved in our community who were hospice workers we have 
doulas a lot of death doulas like a really popular thing right now sc you have to explain what 
is mr so pretty much if someone on the if a job on the birth side there is a 
job on the death side sc yup makes sense mr so death doulas have varying levels just like birth 
of training sc responsibility mr well yeah certification of various like less certified than the birth side because less 
a lot of people perform this service but call it that hospice workers can kind of be a death 
if how you choose to call yourself that but basically easing their transition sc right mr right what you 
do to make people comfortable and that kind of thing so whatever you do that is helping in the 
from life to death same as from in the birthing process whatever you need to do to help that 
that all falls within the doula mindframe sc there must be enormous political and social forces arrayed against the 
to give people these choices right mr yes sc we all remember the death panels controversy just the very 
that you would plan to die rather than going kicking and screaming and eking out every last minute can 
used as a weapon right is that do you think that the tide is turning do you think that 
movement in the death positive direction here mr the level to which death positivity has connected with people in 
very short time frame is pretty astonishing i mean the fact that we have multiple best selling authors and 
people call their events death positive people align themselves with that even if we know them like the first 
i started seeing people calling things death positive and i know who they were that was a big deal 
i mean the amount the sheer amount of people who are like this is you know pretty astonishing our 
is huge and growing all the time so on that hand this is a need that a lot of 
feel like been absent not been an option or been working in a really really small area but they 
about all the other people who can kind who were sort of similarly aligned like a lot of the 
who were speaking at death salon this time been working at home funerals for decades but that was such 
teeny little niche of a thing and and they would be working in their community in this way mr 
global and we have hundreds of thousands of people who watch videos and buy books and come to events 
talk online with each other and do this whole thing so kind and maybe you were interested in it 
you just thought videos were funny but then like i wanna start helping people do home that kind of 
can happen nevertheless we are in a very difficult political climate for that kind of thing because death positivity 
empowering for regular people it often results in very inexpensive options that you need a professional for it we 
very openly intersectional and inclusive and we work all the time to be more and more intersectional and inclusive 
that rubs some people the wrong way sometimes but that we are ultimately a social justice movement and if 
like that then you might not like us anymore even if you liked our videos and stuff before sc 
there has to be a complicating factor of religion or even just of what people think is going to 
after death even if not in the context of an organized religion but certainly in principle i would imagine 
how one approaches the final moments of your life or the life of a loved one will be affected 
whether or not you think the end or whether or not they think going to a better place or 
worse place or some place in between mr yeah definitely religion is a factor but i say necessarily a 
that would draw people away from the movement because a lot of traditions like judaism and islam what they 
do is green burial they embalm they wrap a body wash a body ritualistic washing of a body wrapping 
in a sheet and quick burial that kind of thing is now what people outside of those traditions are 
to get included into what is the stuff been doing all along so that it depends on the religion 
also those things change over time i mean i think it was until vatican ii or something like that 
would ever consider getting cremated if a catholic i mean and now like not a big deal sc so 
in europe mr well in europe the rates are even higher sc the rates of mr of cremation most 
countries looking at of people get cremated and stuff sc wow know it was that high mr we just 
the mark but in the it was something like sc wow okay mr in the us so we were 
way behind the times japan is like sc so children should not go into the embalming business in school 
yeah i personally would if my kid wanted to be an embalmer i would be upset because i want 
to get cancer sc oh is mr it is a a very dangerous profession in that way occupationally dangerous 
alone all the other stuff so yeah not super into embalming as an idea but current plans are me 
my body to medical school which means i will be embalmed to the nth if what happens to me 
like you have to make some decisions sc have you had anyone close to you die since you became 
in the movement mr yeah it was a pretty tragic death too so this was my niece and she 
sc wow mr and she died of an opioid overdose and she left behind a six year old severely 
child and an infant so talk about what is the worst death you can think of sc hard to 
positive about that kind of thing mr the order of the good death this is the opposite of that 
yeah mr all and all the things that were surrounding it that i had to go home and go 
to that it was so just worst nightmare just the worst and so if that happened like five years 
that literally know what i would have done in terms i honestly would probably have just dissociated from the 
thing if i were out here miles away be like sorry i come or something i would just completely 
like luck with if i just deal with it a lot of people deal with situations and then like 
to preserve myself going to peace out on but i knew that my mom she needed me she needed 
my brother needed me people needed me and so i kinda swung into action and that is a thing 
when i am faced with something that i deal with or i think is something really difficult if i 
find a way to do some good in the situation then it makes me it gives me a sense 
control over things i had no control over so me being able to help mr i helped with the 
with my brother i came in and i was talking to my mom about this that and the other 
and then i continually talked to her about my niece she got a tattoo with her name on it 
my mom was extremely affected by it and still is and so other people been like a couple of 
now just like maybe two two or three other people just kind of push it out of their minds 
my mom is still in very deep grief and then i let her be in it and i try 
support her in that and we have authors like megan devine i would recommend her book to anybody ever 
is called okay that not and like it have a time limit not like that was six months ago 
upset about you really need to get over or could have another that kind those things that people say 
so horrible but they come from this idea of wanting to fix things and so although i know i 
said that i was coming in to do things to help i knew i fix it sc but we 
bad at it because part of the fact that our culture denies that death even happens so we were 
trained not anticipating we have good guidelines for proper behavior with the best of intentions people can say the 
heartbreakingly inappropriate things at a time of death because we face up to it mr right if you have 
experience dealing with death and all you know is kind of things that other people say then you end 
saying these cliches that can be really really hurtful to people because the one on the receiving end of 
saying well in a better like so does that make me a bad person i want her here and 
in some better or what if not religious then i like that idea or should be happy to have 
the time you like have you pretty much have an answer to every of all of those cliches which 
like not really thinking about what saying if you did then you would realize that what saying is super 
even though trying to help so familiarizing yourself and getting to learn about these things and really just trying 
be there i found it personally very helpful so i it easy i pretend that it was i pretend 
had a dandy old time sc yeah mr my funeral or anything like that but the fact that i 
able to go in and help out with some things then when i look back like well i feel 
i was able to help and that makes me feel sc and one of the simple things is just 
grief happen in some way no clever saying or condolence that you can give that makes the grief go 
like you said it will be there and it will go away and come back and people deal with 
in their own ways mr yeah like yeah this really or know what to say but sc here for 
yeah but it seems like a lot of the death positive movement is not just about dealing with the 
deaths but also the idea of death and creating something more cultural and artistic and meaningful about the acceptance 
this is going to come to all of us mr right so part of the death denial idea and 
that phrase is really was popularized by this philosopher named ernest becker and he had this best selling book 
one thousand nine hundred seventyfive or something called the denial of death and his construct which is something that 
one of the founding tenets of our movement is that the so these animals that we know know that 
die we know about other level of understanding been some sc but probably less mr but we know for 
that we we know special in the certain way that we humans know that gonna die some day and 
terror of that is too much to handle so we try to do these psychological things to distance and 
that and ignore that idea and we have this death anxiety and trying to do something with it so 
all of culture comes from the death anxiety thing so if you are i know gonna die some day 
really like that idea i wanna leave something of myself behind going to make another human being going to 
some art or record a podcast or strive to the heights of my profession in the hopes that someone 
remember me and put my name on a building or all of those impulses the pyramids and all those 
sc or writing books or even having people have good memories about you to put it in the most 
terms to leave some warm feelings behind mr yeah the idea that you would care about a legacy after 
is a really weird thing but everybody does care at least to some extent people wanna be like i 
if anyone talks about or care what music you play at my funeral i care what you do with 
dead body throw it in a hole i those kind of things are pretty unusual and usually if like 
care at all i care if gonna die tomorrow i care whatever happens to me who those people tend 
protest too much i think the general human condition is one of this push and pull and the more 
face your mortality and engage with these ideas in a way usually starting is comfortable with you like for 
knowledge acquisition sc librarian yeah mr yeah the way i get comfortable by learning things and trying to process 
by learning and you interact with it in your way and then the repeated exposure then makes each exposure 
little less severe and then and able yeah when you make plans when you make choices and you talk 
it with your loved ones and you have this ongoing relationship with death you actually end up being a 
anxious and a more happy person in general usually the reaction sc and other cultures have something like this 
built in than we do these days mr if you look at it one way i have a friend 
works on a buddhist meditation retreat and like this is basically to her like yeah we do corpse meditation 
sit and think about what like to be a corpse we do that all the so there are yeah 
are certain disciplines or religions or whatever where just baked in but in our current state in america in 
increasingly also secular state some of the things that get lost are things like the importance of ritual of 
passages from one stage to the next and why do we care why is there a wedding industrial complex 
do we care about that kind of thing because it matters to mark the change from being a single 
to being a married person that matters who gives a crap about having a birthday party who cares about 
from age one to two i care i care a lot sc a big believer in rituals like all 
my phd students when they defend their thesis they get a bottle of champagne and i get a bottle 
put up on the wall and some of the other professors are like are you bothering with this gonna 
on and do their but like you say a right of passage marking an accomplishment something important in your 
mr yeah it matters it important and what i talked about before with going from the hospital and then 
into then they just disappear you get that demarcation of the change of that person being here and then 
here and it makes it a lot harder for you to process that sc but we have funerals so 
funerals be more fun mr it depends on the person and what they wanted but also with the family 
is the vibe of your family are you an irish wake kind of a family mine kind of would 
of be sc irish wakes for those who know being famous for having lots of drinking and revelry as 
as honoring the dead while there mr because telling stories about someone you loved sc singing songs telling stories 
mr yeah that kind of thing i could see that i see the appeal for sure but yeah meaningful 
you what what marks a transition the funeral is for the living but we have lots of ways to 
things up so that your funeral but also most importantly the end of your life is a thing that 
with your preferences sc that will be the best yeah mr we really we really have much of that 
most of human history did you get that kind of control sc yeah mr and our laws are sort 
been reading about a lot lately been reading a lot about the legal stuff for my book and the 
laws especially are unusually permissive about the wishes of the deceased something that in even in european countries like 
cares dead who cares who cares what you think they wanted or what they said they wanted or but 
very important what you say you want sc and another aspect is the leaving behind of relics or parts 
ourselves which has sure is worth a whole conversation all by itself but one aspect you mentioned in your 
so i definitely wanna get a plug in for the book it exist yet not published yet but tell 
about the book writing i reveal what about you can say that mr okay so give you the nice 
fifty cent phrase because always a big question mark over heads my book is about anthropodermic bibliopegy sc of 
it is mr yeah i mean whose sc it sells itself mr i need you to read another book 
anthropodermic which so break it down anthro sc human mr dermic sc skin mr biblio sc books mr pegy 
a little harder like fasten sc fasten okay mr so books bound in human skin sc now we gotta 
not actually gonna have a special edition bound in human skin or are you gonna go for that mr 
no current plans sc okay mr funny though a lot of people ask me one of the first questions 
get that illegal and the answer is complicated we really know i test it but there a specific law 
says cannot bind a book in human skin that is but there are a lot of there are a 
of laws and our laws in the us are all pretty much based in states so different states have 
laws about whether you can sell human remains like can i buy a human skull i can in some 
and in other states i sc if there were a law against binding books in human skin you would 
to wonder what provoked the legislature to actually do that mr a story there for sure and so there 
any codified rules to say no you do this but just because it say you mean you would want 
be the one to test what the definition of desecration of a corpse means sc but it has been 
historically mr yeah sc binding books in human skin mr most people usually associate that idea because it sounds 
ghoulish and horrible the first thing people think is that must have been a nazi but actually it we 
currently any even alleged books from that actual era all over one hundred years old but usually had a 
involved so got history of medicine and rare books and death all together sc the person to write this 
mr yeah the person turns out i set out in life to be the human skin book lady but 
of what happened and so weird because the rumors of the books of these books started at the same 
that clinical medicine started when i talked about the french revolution so there are alleged books from that era 
most of them were either executed prisoners executed murderers they would it would be an extra punishment to while 
which was a punishment getting dissected was a punishment and only murders got dissected for a while they the 
would sometimes take a piece of skin and then bind a book of their trial or something as like 
at this this is an extra but then the other ones were really just doctors who were book collectors 
had access to these materials that no one else had access to mr and it was like what michel 
called clinical of the way that a doctor looks at patient they have to have a certain amount of 
of distancing clinical distancing to be able to do your job because if you thought about going into room 
and gonna cut open this liver then gonna go to that kind of thing if you actually thought about 
you were doing in the way like looking at this person and thinking about all of their family and 
these things you function too much to bear so you kind of mentally distance yourself but if you take 
to a very far extreme then more like well they were gonna through out this skin we were gonna 
it out anyway might as well save it for a book and what happened and it happened surprisingly a 
so the book sc or it was claimed to happened right so right now left with actual books copies 
volumes in libraries or collections that some documentary claim that this is bound in human skin and part of 
job is to figure out whether true mr well so for the longest time this was just a ghoulish 
right did you hear about this book that exists and it says in human and a lot of people 
they were maybe fake or whatever but then there is a chemist at harvard who one of the conservators 
harvard asked doing these proteomics tests these peptide mass which is a very common easy chemistry test you do 
testing on a human skin book because dna is too sensitive so if i was handling the book which 
do without gloves by the way because a myth in rare books that you wear gloves sc you can 
your fingers mr yeah you wear gloves actually more likely to damage a book or rip a page or 
if wearing gloves than if you have sc good tip mr bare washed hands so if i was holding 
of those books and then you happened to take a sample off of this thing you might get human 
where the leather itself is not human but also every time you do a weird process which making skin 
leather is a pretty intense process and also age the dna just degrades and degrades and degrades so dna 
actually too sensitive and it really work but the peptide mass fingerprinting what looking at is the collagen in 
leather and that lasts for thousands of years and is very very stable but you can only get down 
to the animal family so he tested there were three alleged human skin books at harvard and two of 
were fake but one of them was real and then that kind people freaked out laughter just completely freaked 
sc our library has human skin books mr yeah and then so i was kind of toying with doing 
book that was sort of related to death and also things in collections in library collections and since i 
going to boston anyway i went and talked to daniel kirby the chemist about it and then i every 
i go to a library i was asking around about these books and do you have one like this 
you have and a surprising amount of people were like actually we do have this book that they say 
and so we decided to compare notes and then we also got another chemist on board and then the 
of the mutter museum and we formed this kinda interdisciplinary group called the anthropodermic book project mr so been 
to hunt down these books in public collections like libraries and museums around the world and thus far found 
fifty credible actually existent alleged books and tested somewhere like thirty of them and about i wanna say eighteen 
so were real and twelve were fake so a not quite even but pretty close to even split and 
time we test one it is a whole new revelation we learned because such a small cohort you learn 
much more about the history each time there is one book where we tested and it was people were 
they must be like sexy you know these erotic books and i was like there and then we tested 
that was and i was like well there is at least one sc were there any bibles mr there 
three in france at the bibliotheque nationale that are actually incredibly old century bibles that were allegedly human skin 
seen them been there but i very much doubt that real completely out of the normal range of time 
i think the banff is gonna give us slivers of their century bibles love it anyone listening sc to 
out that they have books bound in human skin in it for them really mr appelezmoi about the skin 
there but yeah so seen them and beautiful books on their own right but i just i my spidey 
say probably not but i try not to say or unless got the test sc why you gotta do 
science mr yeah we get new results all the time sc and not any noninvasive tests that we have 
mr right but this is so minimally invasive like if you can see the sample with your eye then 
is plenty big sc right mr so you could easily take a piece off of a binding and you 
never notice that gone the old dna test when they tried to do stuff like that they would take 
huge stamp size squares out of something it would ruin a book you do that so this is more 
you can definitely test it and find out and the beauty of it is that a cheap and simple 
and then you have this whole world of knowledge suddenly about this practice so it just i find it 
exciting every time we get results just so excited about learning about these books and so interesting to see 
because people have really wide reactions too some people are like and some people are like or so glad 
is fake so that we can stop telling the campus tour when the campus tour guides come and say 
they have a book bound in human we a handout about how this is fake leave us alone learn 
else to say about the sc does looking forward to this does your book have a title mr called 
archives but the after colon is not totally finished yet sc last minute as always yeah mr something like 
in human skin patient objectification and the humanizing of or something like that a working on it still but 
will be out in the fall of sc excellent very very good so just wrapping up any words of 
how people should change their perspective on death is there anything that learned that you sort of have already 
you got into this how should we just change our point of view should we think about death more 
should we think about it as more fun should we think of it as more social what should we 
mr i would say the more that you interact with it the easier it gets in that you never 
the goal to completely alleviate your fear or of death or whatever sc death is still bad mr yeah 
gonna be scary a scary thing because you know when you know how the ultimate scary thing but the 
you talk about it the more you can feel comfortable about your choices the if you know what a 
member wants and you do the things that they ask you to do one less thing you ever have 
think about like we do right by so the opening conversations and having continual conversations over time your thoughts 
change over time your life situation changes over time just keep checking in on that it really does alleviate 
of the anxiety of it and what i found personally is and this something i expected but looking back 
does actually makes sense is that when you realize that your life is actually finite you appreciate your life 
and that was not an intention that i had getting into this i was just interested intellectually mostly and 
kind of i like to kind of liking it to we grew up in pennsylvania when you brushed your 
did you ever turn off the water when you brushed your teeth sc no mr right why would you 
that sc not an east coast thing mr yeah why would you do that sc water is infinite mr 
water you turn on the tap water will always come out you have water all over the place just 
living in los angeles you realize wait water is finite and really important and not necessarily gonna be around 
maybe i should be careful about the way i use it maybe i can do simple things like turning 
the tap when i brush my and you know now i always turn off the tap and sort of 
appreciate water when it rains here like in heaven so happy every time it rains if it rained in 
i would be like great this is so but here magical because i appreciate it because not always there 
if you look at life that way then you really live differently so when big important things happen in 
life i actually try to stop and take a moment to acknowledge that it happened when we were talking 
the rituals and stuff those are stopping and taking a moment those are the things that when you look 
over your life those are the things that stick out is the moment that you took when that happened 
i remember getting that phone call when i got you know that kind of those big things you take 
moment to remember it and then it just i know it just adds a lot to your appreciation sc 
your life has been enriched by taking your death more seriously mr yes absolutely sc alright megan rosenbloom thanks 
much for being on our podcast mr thank you music beautiful podcast great movement simply thought out as a 
who has seen quite a few deaths from a young age i think for dealing with death ones own 
loved ones helps we are bornwe live thus we die in order to keep religion out of the process 
can just look it at from the point of view as my atoms are just losingbeginning to lose structure 
returning to the universe in unstructured form i thought this was an interesting topic but there was or some 
of high pitch noise in the background for most of this that made me stop listening half way through 
am deeply triggered by this but i know trolling get me anywhere in any case have you heard of 
benatar regardless you should have him on fyi the idea of a life well lived is an absurd concept 
wonder if people would choose to have a book bound with their skin after death what book would they 
not yet a supporter so maybe wrong for me to complain about not optimizing sound quality but it was 
to listen to this podcast in my car with the extra noise i had to pause every so often 
to reassure myself that i about to slip a belt otherwise huge fan keep up the great work yourself 
hold that death is nothing to us because good and evil consist in sensation and death is the removal 
sensation a correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable not because it 
you an unbounded span of time but because it removes the desire for immortality there is nothing terrifying in 
to someone who truly understands that there is nothing terrifying in the absence of epicurus while a great topic 
guest came across as too and insincere maybe just my age have enjoyed the majority of your podcasts thank 
for another great episode i really enjoyed your conversations i like how megan argues that we should think a 
more about ideas that make us uncomfortable and interact with this discomfort more often i could not disagree more 
a couple of hundred years once we learn to extend lifespans considerably humans will look back on our current 
norm of thinking is wise to be alright with to be one of the craziest ideas humans have ever 
people will look back on our lack of funding into lifeextension research to be a moral disgrace this deathpositive 
is potentially harmful in that it encourages a general attitude that lifeextension research is not of crucial importance it 
not alright to be alright with death why the derision and laughter at typical american burial rituals but seeming 
for every other country or practices seems like scholarly people would be curious about the origins and evolution of 
of the thousands practices of dealing with the dead throughout time comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with
