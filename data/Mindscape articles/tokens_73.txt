carroll as heard climate change is happening the earth is getting warmer and various other aspects of our climate 
our ecosystem are being affected and human activity is an extremely important the most important cause of it this 
is scientifically clear but as also undoubtedly heard not everyone agrees with this not everyone accepts the scientific evidence 
is especially true in the united states where a powerful movement that denies the scientific consensus on climate change 
can even go to wikipedia and a whole page on climate change denial our climate is in the midst 
dramatic changes driven largely by human activity with potentially enormous consequences for humanity and other species why science tells 
anyway but there is an influential contingent especially in the united states who deny that reality and work hard 
prevent policy action that might ameliorate it where did this resistance come from and what makes it so successful 
oreskes is a distinguished historian of science who has become halfreluctantly the expert on this question it turns out 
be a fascinating story starting with just a handful of scientists who were passionate not only about climate but 
whether smoking causes cancer and who cared deeply about capitalism communism and the cold war support mindscape on patreon

the public reception of science merchants of doubt coauthored with erik m conway was made into a featurelength documentary 
click to show episode transcript sc so one can ask the question did this come from why especially here 
the united and guest naomi oreskes is an historian of science who has investigated this question the coauthor of 
very influential book merchants of doubt which was later made into a documentary film and not gonna give away 
much of what we talked about because a fascinating road to go down but one of the most interesting 
of the story is that a lot of the climate denial movement can be traced to a small number 
scientists who were also involved in other denialist movements like denying that smoking causes cancer why did these people 
to make this their cause the story is tied up with issues of capitalism and communism and the cold 
and just an incredibly interesting intricate story that was worth following up on so gonna talk about that i 
about that with naomi and also how things have evolved since merchants of doubt was published a very important 
at how our discourse is shaped one that is only gonna become more relevant to social policy and communication 
as time goes on so go music sc naomi oreskes thank you so much for being on this podcast 
oreskes welcome pleasure to be here with you sc now you work in areas about the history of science 
specifically disinformation controversy people going against the consensus and these days in a world where a lot of people 
talking about fake news and controversies over the scientific fact and so forth it gets a little depressing at 
point right i mean how did you get into this intentionally or did you just kind of stumble into 
or were you dragged into it no nobody grows up saying when i grow up going to work on 
what i thought no the way that i do now but no no i and i really think of 
as working on disinformation i think of what i work on as actually knowledge production so i became a 
of science about thirty years ago i started out as a scientist but i was interested in what we 
broadly call broader questions about science and society and one thing i became interested in early on was the 
of how do scientists decide when they have enough evidence when we have enough evidence to say that we 
something because when studying science presented with all this information told there are these interesting different things going on 
nobody really ever talks about how scientists decided we know this thing right sc is some no yeah is 
some threshold sc who decides no who decides sc who no who votes exactly and science an election right 
as it happened i started college in dating myself now you can do the arithmetic but the interesting thing 
one thousand nine hundred seventysix in earth science it was just a few years after the plate tectonics revolution 
so it was a very interesting time to be an undergraduate because our professors were all very excited and 
us how lucky we were to be coming into this field now that this huge new great theory had 
developed and there were so many things we understood properly now that we understand before and i remember thinking 
i actually feel like that means come late it would have been better to have been there while it 
sc while happening yeah no but actually not how the professors presented it interestingly enough but then i had 
opportunity to travel and study abroad and i discovered an interesting fact which was that the same idea the 
of moving continents had been proposed in the by alfred wegener and the idea had been rejected and so 
was kind of an interesting thing well why did we reject this idea sixty years ago and now saying 
and i also found that in england people viewed plate tectonics much less as a revolution and much more 
a kind of evolution from the continental drift debate so a few years later when i was in grad 
i decided to just take a philosophy of science class sc there you go no as you said you 
only in my sc down the rabbit hole no yeah exactly chuckle and so i had to write a 
paper and so i proposed to my professor that i would like to write a paper about this question 
ten years later or more than that my first book that ended up being my phd and my first 
project and so what really interested in what does it even mean to say that something constitutes scientific evidence 
do scientists like some kind of evidence better than others and the other thing i experienced in graduate school 
that scientists sometimes get very hot under the collar about the right way to do science and often those 
seem to me to be quite poorly substantiated by history or philosophy or any kind of real intellectual argument 
people would say do that bad or you would hear professors say or sometimes hear physicists dismiss the entire 
of geology you know as descriptive blah blah and i thought this first of all this is ridiculous geology 
a science clearly a science and we deserve to be treated with respect even if we do things darwin 
of the greatest scientists of all time was inspired by geology originally wanted to be a geologist and actually 
himself to be a geologist so to say that you do rigorous work in an observational mode flies in 
face of the history of science but yeah you would hear some people not to bash physicists sc physicists 
the worst go ahead no very opinionated about methodology and so i just thought this is interesting this is 
that should be studied why do they have these strong opinions and why do geologists feel defensive about what 
do even though what we do is important and interesting and we have successfully explained a heck of lot 
important things about the so anyway one thing led to another and what i did and what i do 
did you come to a conclusion about this question of how we decide that something is true is there 
threshold or is it just come and go no no really a matter of consensus and why i got 
in the problem of consensus so what i would argue now is that scientific knowledge is the things that 
have agreed on and the conditions under which they get to agree are very historically and socially contingent so 
really cannot answer the question of why decided we know enough to say this is without actually understanding the 
context in which that discussion takes place sc but always interesting to me because as a good bayesian i 
that you should never be sure about any scientific claim but on the other hand you can be so 
that not gonna bother to listen to contrary claims either right no right or sure enough that not a 
use of your time sc exactly no and if somebody would come up with some strong counterargument based on 
then as a good scientist really compelled to listen and in a sense that is what happened in the 
tectonics debate scientists rejected the idea of continental drift for a variety of reasons some good some in my 
not so good but in the when new evidence came about they did reopen the debate and so you 
say that actually science worked pretty well because in fact we did get it sorted out you could say 
not so well because there was this hiatus no but in my new book coming out i actually feel 
thirty years later actually sorted out this question if that sound too bold of me but i actually now 
that it would have been sorted out by the late and it nearly was sorted out there were some 
doing some work that they presented at a major conference in in which they pretty much had all the 
of what would later be called plate tectonics but then world war ii broke out and all of the 
people started working on classified military work so they got diverted onto other things and of course this is 
perfect example of historical contingency the war breaks out they get asked to work on other things they do 
are loyal americans they want to support the war effort and then that but that but when the war 
they just go back to what they were doing before now been sent on a different pathway no not 
the that a different group of scientists in the united kingdom come up with some new fresh evidence mostly 
geomagnetism and they reopen the debate and at that point one of the key people who had worked on 
in the then he gets back involved and then very quickly within a very short period of time we 
plate tectonics so my argument now is that actually the hiatus was really a socially contingent historically contingent thing 
was really related to world war ii and that if world war ii broken out i think we would 
had the theory of plate tectonics let say by the so the whole thing would have taken maybe years 
pretty normal for science yeah sc okay right oh yeah no so not like some big epistemological failure here 
like no scientists work in the real world like the rest of us and affected by social pressures political 
economic issues and so there it is sc it almost seems trite to say that but also something that 
lot of scientists no deny sc yeah they deny it explicitly or implicitly right no right they either think 
it or sometimes they actually deny it explicitly sc yeah and like to think that science eventually gets the 
answer but not immediately that it gets the right answer no no never immediately because no way it could 
because it takes time to sort out to sort through all these different questions and to have the arguments 
counterarguments that you have to have so getting back to your point absolutely no person should ever be too 
of their own conclusions in the there was a phrase people used to use autointoxication laughter it is such 
great word right we all have colleagues who are autointoxicated sc yes yes no we all know what that 
like and not a good thing so really important in any branch of intellectual work to always be aware 
the idea that you might be wrong but if scientists have been working on an issue for fifty years 
pretty much looked at it from lots of different angles and come to the conclusion that the evidence is 
that this is correct and maybe looked at some key issues like with climate science back in the scientists 
out this issue of whether the observed warming could be the sun these questions had been addressed and answered 
right no so at that point then two things happen first of all it would frankly be a waste 
time to be doing the same thing over and over again you want to move on part of why 
progresses if it can be said to progress because we keep arguing the same points all over again and 
because in this case we have serious decisions to make based on climate science sc a ticking clock no 
ticking clock and the longer we delay the worse the consequences become sc so this is like an out 
left field question but what saying is making me think about things like the individual scientists not only do 
get in the way but they have intuitions they have preferences they have things that they think are right 
so there could just be intellectual resistance all in very good faith but just like this feel right to 
so not going to accept it have you ever thought about how something like that plays out in something 
physics or cosmology like with superstring theory no oh absolutely sure yeah well this is the biggest argument i 
for diversity in science and by that i just mean demographic diversity but intellectual diversity as well i think 
have good evidence from the history of science that when scientific communities are nondiverse either demographically or intellectually and 
they are closed and tend to be sort of a closed group of experts only talking to each other 
that is not entirely healthy and so one of the reasons one of the reasons why we have conferences 
why we have peer review we have mechanisms in science to say well sean carroll has this theory he 
right and you can be as enthusiastic about your theory as you want and to some extent being enthusiastic 
good sc sure no but now not going to take his word for it going to send this to 
other reviewers preferably to people who his friends and hopefully review it be a tough review but if they 
i really like those caltech people chuckle no then sort of the whole point of peer review and so 
long as that is happening and as long as you really do have independent peer review and you have 
diverse community where different perspectives can be heard then i think most of the time in pretty good shape 
yeah i think that that sounds right to me i think that the practical issue is that if a 
hiring people and deciding which areas to hire in and in principle in favor of intellectual diversity in practice 
think no the people are working on this are just smarter and more correct than the people working on 
just very hard for people to say we think this person is working on less interesting things but we 
hire them anyway because of diversity no yeah well right it is hard to do that and so you 
not expect any one department to achieve that but the physics community as a whole can achieve that and 
people are not open to the idea that some other approaches could be valuable and important then that can 
a problem and i think you know you raised string theory not an expert in string theory but we 
know that there have been some pretty vocal debates about whether string theory is a good way to go 
not and good that that debate is taking place it would be bad if it in a way right 
yeah i find myself in a weird position prostring theory i think it has a lot to offer but 
think maybe a bit too much of it i think that hard for those people in the string theory 
who by now have been divorced from experimental data for decades to say we need some nonstring theory voices 
say that they think on the right track no so i think that a pretty strong argument from history 
that a strong counter argument against that and especially what you said the bit about being divorced from experimental 
because you could be doing your thing and be very convinced that on the right track but as long 
you have some other people doing experimental data or some ground truth then some kind of tension if i 
use that word a healthy productive tension that forced to engage with these other lines of reasoning or evidence 
other sources sc the best reality check no right exactly sc the data no and i talk about that 
a lot of my work that in the century william whewell developed his concept of consilience of evidence and 
wilson has popularized it again recently and i think that whewell was right about that that we can feel 
confident about our conclusions when we have lots of lines of evidence that stand alone independently preferably collected by 
people maybe in different parts of the globe or at least different universities sc maybe they even like each 
right no maybe they like each other maybe from mit laughter but if even when people who have different 
and like each other and use different methods still come to the same conclusion then got some pretty good 
to feel like this is probably pretty good but if only got one group of people and all doing 
same thing then maybe not so great sc and i thought that so one of the things that figured 
noticed found in your research is that just a small number of people having contrarian views can be put 
use by these social forces that we mentioned so how did you first get into this specific line of 
that led to merchants of doubt no well like most important things it was an accident so i was 
on what was going to be my full professor book a big book on the history of cold war 
looking at the question of what difference did it make who was funding the science because oceanography in the 
states went from being almost nonexistent in the early century to being a very welldeveloped science by say the 
that was almost entirely the result of military funding during the cold war because of the significance of oceanography 
antisubmarine warfare no so that seemed you know in history we have controlled experiments but that was sort of 
close to one as i could get where you had this very clear change so i was working on 
and one of the things the narrative arc sort of begins at woods hole and scripps where very small 
they have almost no money and then it begins to change as the navy begins to fund it and 
tracked this arc from the to the where the reverse problem begins to happen the navy begins to dial 
its support and the scientists are worrying about how going to fund their science going forward no and i 
a cache of letters of a group of scientists at scripps scripps institution of oceanography some of whom i 
personally in which they were talking about this issue and they were actually going to the dean at the 
who i also knew saying need to figure out what the next big source of funding for our work 
going to be and we think climate and so these letters are being written in the and so i 
that was pretty interesting because before most of us were really aware of climate change as an issue sc 
am just gonna ask hard for me to remember what i was i was in college or whatever but 
debate had begun about that time no not really jim hansen testifies in congress in sc okay no the 
is created in sc so we were talking about acid rain and ozone holes but not yet global warming 
no climate change really come into the public sphere but here these scientists were talking about it so i 
that was interesting just by itself like that scientists were and in a way it made sense because hansen 
testified in so obviously he must have been working on it for some period leading up to that so 
made me interested in the sort of earlier history and i started digging in a bit more about what 
scientists know about the question of manmade global warming back in the and found a much richer more complicated 
than i had previously known but also i remember thinking this seems a little no and at the time 
contrarians were claiming this is just a big excuse to get money for your and i was like well 
mean this is maybe not an excuse but it is being put forward as a reason to get money 
their and so that made me think that it just needed a little more investigating so how serious was 
threat were they exaggerating the threat to get funding because certainly during the cold war many historians would argue 
did exaggerate the soviet threat to get money for scientific research and other things so it seem completely impossible 
that was happening here but when i started digging into it i found that actually it seemed to me 
anything the scientists had underestimated the threat and when i started looking about how much we actually already knew 
this issue even in the there were reports from the national research council there was a very significant report 
i found that had been written by the sc oh yeah no the world meteorological organization had had a 
meeting in i think something like that so actually there was quite a bit of evidence already at that 
that this was potentially a quite serious issue and so then i just started looking a bit more into 
and so now so doing two things at once researching this earlier history trying to understand how scientists came 
say that climate change would be the next big scientific issue in the but doing this work in the 
when climate change denial is already a thing and right around the time i was doing this president george 
bush responded to an nrc report by saying i really think a consensus on the right and there was 
notorious sentence where he got asked about this report and he said i read the report put out by 
chuckle no yeah right so yeah sc maybe yeah those reports are completely unreliable no yeah just a bureaucracy 
do they know anyway so i decided to try to answer the question well is there a consensus because 
president of the united states was saying there but all the scientists around me seemed to be agreeing about 
issue sc and the father when he was president was actually very interested in combating global warming no correct 
too correct so anyway trying to make a long story short that led to my publishing my paper on 
scientific consensus on climate change in which was the first paper that analyzed the question of whether or not 
was a consensus among scientists and little beknownst to me i guess some people would now say that i 
invented the methodology of consensus analysis which i doing deliberately but i guess maybe i did anyway so i 
that article and i really thought i was naive enough to think that people were just confused about the 
sc you would explain to them about this consensus no about this consensus it consensus show them the data 
a quantitative analysis objective science citation index blah blah blah and i even made a point of saying in 
paper a consensus about the reality of climate change does not tell us what to do about it the 
questions are another set of questions and that requires a different kind of so i was really quite clear 
that i thought i had been a very responsible scholar sc right no and then i got slammed sc 
no just slammed threatening phone calls hostile email attacks by the senator from oklahoma i mean really crazy stuff 
so this is no and i say this was my alice through the looking glass moment it was like 
had gone down some weird rabbit hole into a parallel universe chuckle with a lot of people who thought 
climate change was a liberal conspiracy and who knows what other things and so at first it was frankly 
scary a little frightening getting death threats is no fun and thinking published a paper in science magazine getting 
death threat this is like something has to be explained here sc imagine telling your parents would like to 
a historian of and them saying a very no yeah exactly i know exactly who would have thought right 
just got back from giving a talk in texas where i had an armed guard with me the whole 
now i was told they do that for all their visitors sc they just like being armed chuckle no 
so exactly this was just a very strange experience and i feel in this moment it was a nice 
of luck i guess i remember thinking if i were a scientist if stayed being a strict geologist i 
be able to investigate this because it be geology but a historian so if something is happening i can 
follow it where it and kind of what done for the last now fourteen years just been a set 
leads and followed them and so not really doing any geology anymore and a lot of what doing is 
tangentially related to some of the original questions that i started out interesting in although obviously it all kind 
circles back in the end but i just started thinking who are these people why are they attacking me 
is what i said threatening and why does the president of the united states think no consensus about climate 
when there clearly and that set of why questions led to us writing merchants of doubt sc and i 
a little bit about the controversy of course but still i guess i know too much about it only 
reading your book did i realize that not only was there a kind of epistemological connection between the arguments 
climate change and other arguments like tobacco or whatever acid rain but the same people a handful of people 
you can count on the fingers of one hand and these characters show up over and over again no 
sc so tells us tell our podcast audience about this whole story no sure also this was the big 
that erik conway my coauthor and i made and it was really erik who first realized that something was 
on here because i went to a conference in germany a very important famous group the international commission for 
history of meteorology so a very small very obscure and i gave a talk on a small element of 
history of climate science some work that was done in the but at the end of the talk in 
qa it came up that i was being attacked and i had mentioned by name one of the people 
was attacking me and later that day in the bar over beer erik conway who was at the meeting 
i met yet came up to me and as it turned out he was writing a book on the 
of atmospheric science at nasa and a whole section of the book was about work on the ozone hole 
ozone depletion and he had come across a whole stash of materials of people who had attacked the scientists 
worked on the ozone hole including particularly sherry rowland who shared in the nobel prize for that work and 
sc sorry she was being attacked no right sherry rowland sc sherry rowland is a he no is a 
so yeah sherwood rowland i wish that she was a woman but no although sherry was a great guy 
would have been even greater if she was a woman so back in the and early sherry and his 
had been attacked for their work on climate on the ozone hole erik said to me you know the 
who are attacking you the same people who attacked sherry and i knew enough about that history not about 
attacks but about the science to think that so and then i thought did you just say my name 
the same sentence as sherry rowland nobel laureate one of the greatest most important scientists in the century without 
we would all be like dying of ozone depletionrelated anyway he said when i go home send you some 
he sent me this package of materials that he had and it was like do you remember the game 
libs sc oh yeah no right where you just substitute the words sc yeah no it was like exactly 
same sc there was a template no there was a template and you could take out global warming and 
in ozone hole and it was identical and it was the same people sc wow no and one of 
was fred seitz and as you probably know fred seitz was an extremely famous century physicist sc well that 
the other thing not like a merry band of little crackpots these are big names that are banding together 
right so thinking fred seitz so i was enough of a historian of science to know that who he 
and to think why is fred seitz doing this right and so i just started digging a little bit 
to find out a little bit more about him and then i hit what i think of as kind 
the big reveal was the discovery that he worked for rj reynolds tobacco and so at that point i 
another colleague my colleague robert proctor at stanford done a lot to work on the history of tobacco and 
said have you ever heard of fred he goes have i ever heard of fred so two days later 
package comes in the mail a big stack of documents about connections to rj reynolds same thing this time 
out climate change put in tobacco right and so then we began thought a story sc yeah no not 
that the arguments sound similar that actually the same arguments being made by the same people and that some 
here that has to be and so i put aside the oceanography book put it on back burner said 
work on sc and one of your questions was like you said these are fred seitz and the others 
big names they are famous scientists not that they misunderstand the science no correct sc there has to be 
other set of reasons no right and that was one of the really important things we really realized early 
that in a way was good that there was just no possibility that this was scientific illiteracy right because 
people at the time were assuming that if people accept climate science it was because they understand the science 
therefore if you just explained the science better more clearly fewer graphs less jargon that you would get through 
people and this blew that argument out of the water right this had nothing to do and so then 
question became what does it have to do and it took us time we spent several years digging through 
lot of materials but then when we began to find these linkages to these various libertarian rightwing thinktanks then 
story became clear that this was ideologically motivated it was driven by anxieties about communism and the fear that 
regulation of the marketplace was a kind of slippery slope to socialism and we actually found places where they 
exactly that in their own words sc yes fill that out a little bit when was the argument about 
happening the no well so a little bit complicated the original argument about smoking really begins in the with 
surgeon general report and by the it was pretty clear smoking caused cancer and a host of other terrible 
and by the there were bans on smoking in public places people were starting to win lawsuits against the 
industry in the early the us department of justice filed suit against them for conspiracy to commit fraud against 
american people so this played out over a period of time but beginning in the and running through the 
seitz started working for the tobacco company in so this is well after the bulk of the scientific evidence 
clear sc the science had been done no the science was basically done at that point so question one 
would he make common cause with the tobacco industry and then a kind of second round that fred singer 
involved with in the early over the issue of secondhand smoke and interesting the tobacco industry was never admirable 
its behavior but it became even less admirable at this point because this is when the rubber really hit 
road because up until this point they had been arguing that smoking is a personal choice that if smokers 
the risks and choose to take those risks their choice and in a free society we want the government 
that choice for us and up to a point a reasonable argument sc an argument you can make it 
it fits in no fits in with the freedom sc freedom capitalism no correct so not crazy and not 
lie right a judgment about what role you think the government should or should not play in protecting consumers 
dangerous products but in the late the scientific evidence became overwhelming that secondhand smoke also killed people and at 
point the argument about personal choice is blown out of the water and when the tobacco industry got really 
and did some of the more ugly and nefarious things they did including one project they had which they 
project white coat which who wears white coats scientists it was to recruit scientists to defend tobacco because they 
to realize that the industry had lost credibility but if they could have scientists defending it that would have 
credibility and particularly journalists they could get journalists to present both sides of the story and this technique was 
effective so if you look at say articles in the new york times from the very much like scientists 
this but this other guy this other and very often not made clear that the scientist defending the tobacco 
is in fact on the payroll of the industry sc well it is one of the things about how 
works in combination with how law works and legislation works and journalism works is that even if there are 
hundred people on one side and two people on the other side still two sides and no exactly right 
like no so it really right yeah you say get a representative from one side and the and so 
a small number of scientists who are willing to say that secondhand smoke is not so bad or no 
up can have an outsized impact for that reason right no exactly and the tobacco industry recognized that and 
exploited it and so that was their whole strategy was to create this impression of a debate and they 
that they only needed a few people to help them do that if they had fred seitz fred singer 
a few others they could very quickly create the impression of a significant scientific debate and of course seen 
recapitulated now with climate science sc yeah you mentioned which makes me think of my days in high school 
college and ronald reagan was president and it might be hard for the youthful podcastlistening audience out there to 
themselves in the mindset of there was a real threat of nuclear war that at least there was an 
that this is something that could realistically happen we need to defend ourselves and it was really not just 
rivalry between two countries but a clash of world views of the sort of collectivist communist view and our 
freedom view and therefore and suddenly a chain of logic that says that government regulation and restriction on industry 
sort of a slippery slope towards communism no right well exactly right and i think two important points like 
make about that so one is that one of the big problems with much of the thinking that we 
in merchants of doubt is this dichotomization manichean cold war mentality and it is understandable old enough to remember 
cold war it certainly is understandable that in the context of the soviet threat it was easy to slip 
a kind of manichean world view but the reality of course is that our choices are not simply totalitarian 
on one hand and total free market libertarian chaos on the other a lot of choices in between and 
course there are many countries in the world particularly in western europe that have a different balance of free 
principles and government involvement than we do no but it became very difficult to have that conversation during the 
war and i would say that ronald reagan is part of the reason for that reagan made it worse 
there was a period under kennedy johnson nixon particularly under nixon when we had detente we we saw perestroika 
the soviet union there was a kind of relaxation of hostilities and an increasing degree of trade with the 
union an increasing degree of conversation you know that one of the tragedies of richard nixon was that he 
had some very significant foreign policy successes in lessening the tensions with the soviet union and also had some 
interventions in the marketplace here in the united states including really important pieces of environmental legislation so there was 
kind of middle ground that we actually were moving to in the no but reagan stopped that and he 
dialed it back and dialed up the rhetoric much more to something more like what we had seen in 
where the soviet union was the evil empire there was no compromise and it was all or nothing and 
kind of allornothing thinking made it much harder then to talk to conservatives about something like the un framework 
on climate change or the montreal protocol because they saw these things as collectivist communistic and a threat and 
made it hard for them to recognize that ozone depletion was also a threat and may be actually a 
one no and then the second point about this has to do with nuclear winter which is a much 
but very important debate from this time period and actually in our book one of our early chapters is 
nuclear winter but the chapter i think nobody reads because nobody really sees what does nuclear winter have to 
with this it seems like a little out of place but actually usually important because many of the people 
later became involved in climate change denial were also involved in the nuclear winter debate and part of the 
was because response to the threat of nuclear war was arms control and to try to dial it back 
the size of the stockpile lessen the threat level on both sides no reagan rejected that his argument was 
opposite it was that we should build up our defenses and make the cost of a nuclear war that 
greater so sort of a return to the mad philosophy the mutual assured destruction and again you could nobody 
knows only god knows which strategy was better so it was arguable but what reagan did that was very 
and upsetting to many scientists was that he began to talk about the possibility of a winnable nuclear war 
that was absurd because all of the scientific evidence suggested if we had a massive exchange nobody was gonna 
we would all be incinerated and there was no way to even sc what does it mean to win 
what does it even mean to win right exactly i once found a memo in the archive where an 
was proposing to equip a submarine to protect the president and the vice president in the event of a 
nuclear exchange and then i remember reading this and thinking then when they came back up what would they 
laughter it was just sc yes no right but there was a lot of that kind of strange thinking 
the cold war so when reagan began to do that a lot of scientists spoke up against it and 
is ridiculous no such thing as a nuclear and the nuclear winter argument was part of that argument so 
a group of scientists including carl sagan and a number of others turco and others did this modeling work 
calculate what would be the effect of a massive nuclear exchange in terms of its all the dust and 
that would be left in the atmosphere afterwards and what they showed was that it would lead to a 
dramatic cooling of the atmosphere so much so that it would potentially push the earth into a nuclear winter 
major crop failure so that even if you survived the initial exchange which you probably but even if you 
maybe you were in some outlying place you were up in the yukon or something in australia you would 
be affected that the whole globe would be affected be no escaping the consequences no and this drove the 
administration crazy and so it was one of the early examples of where scientists are doing science but it 
policy ramification and so the reagan administration conservatives went on a pretty strong campaign to discredit that work they 
the work attacked carl sagan and seitz was part of that too and so some early hints of this 
story in that debate so it really does go back to ronald reagan and really an the reagan administration 
a really important node in this history sc and you can see how politicians have their predilections about how 
run the global order and also corporations wanna make money and wanna avoid being regulated but the scientists here 
if they were on the payroll gonna guess and tell me if right they even the crazy minority scientists 
are acting against the consensus were doing so because they believed it was true right no yeah yeah i 
right sc they actually in it for the money no no no i think one of the important points 
our book is that most of this is not actually about money i mean behind the scientists yes there 
industries that have great financial stakes and certainly the tobacco industry it was all about money but i think 
for fred seitz when he goes to work for rj reynolds not primarily about the money i mean getting 
sure that plays some role but the ideological justification is also really important if not more important sc yeah 
they really got organized they started the george marshall institute was it no correct they created a think tank 
named it after george c marshall of the marshall plan because of its role in fighting communism so already 
clue about how thinking about this although personally i think george c marshall would have agreed with what they 
but just my opinion sc not around no not around to say one way or the other yeah so 
created a think tank and they organized a series of programs particularly aimed at the press to persuade the 
that there was a big debate that scientists have a consensus and also to influence public policy so they 
reports to the white house and they played a significant role during the administration of george hw bush because 
you said our first president bush accepted the scientific evidence of climate change he was really the last major 
political leader apart from john mccain to be on board about the science and he went to rio de 
for the earth summit in and he signed the un framework convention on climate change but already there were 
in the bush administration who did not want him to do that and there was in fact a big 
in the white house about whether or not bush should go to rio and nierenberg and his colleagues played 
significant role in they had written a report an early report published in that challenged the scientific evidence they 
that reporting to the white house via sc john sununu no john sununu i keep forgetting his name his 
is now in politics his son is chris sununu john sununu who was white house chief of staff i 
at the time so through sununu they get this report to the white house and it circulates and there 
one white house staffer who said yes everyone has read i remember when i read that i thought well 
you so bill nierenberg because of his position director of scripps done all these important things he has access 
has friends in the white house most scientists have that right so a lot of my scientific colleagues were 
of moaning and groaning about how politicians seem to understand climate science and thinking so look at this story 
getting this from bill nierenberg a scientist seems credible right sc so it is the same people there from 
and secondhand smoke and then the acid rain controversy and the ozone hole controversy and eventually climate change am 
missing a controversy no no it in the book we have one extra chapter that was like a slight 
but we thought it was important about ddt sc oh yeah no seitz nierenberg and john sununu actually get 
in the ddt debate but some of the people they worked with did and we thought it was important 
include that because one of the places where you see some of the more outrageous accusations being made in 
they actually take a debate a scientific debate that has been already settled for decades and try to reopen 
and so we were thinking why do they wanna reopen the debate about well because if they do they 
discredit the epa which was partly created because of the ddt story and then that i mean look at 
we are today right sc rachel carson is the greatest murderer no i know i mean completely insane right 
insane i remember when i first saw that saying to some people like when i give public lectures saying 
was richard nixon who created the epa so i mean why they say that richard nixon is the murderer 
he has blood on his so also very sexist it was laden with all kinds of gender bias as 
so that ddt story seemed important in terms of the larger political context and how these tactics then spread 
the broader community sc and one of the amazing things is just how effective that these tactics are and 
think that presumably we need to go beyond certain individual journalistic or legislative tactics to just the human psychology 
why so many people come on board found graphs about the different fraction of democrats and republicans who believe 
human activity is causing global warming no reason for there to be any correlation between that political position but 
clearly is no from a scientist standpoint no reason but from a cultural standpoint of course there is and 
part of what trying to understand here and so i think a couple of different things going on so 
thing is nobody likes bad news so if i tell you is really bad we have to spend a 
of money now fixing this and someone else tells you no fine got the better message right so scientists 
a real uphill battle with trying to persuade people to take climate change seriously and if someone comes along 
says you have to many people are gonna take that and whether democrats republicans independents whatever then wishful thinking 
think wishful thinking plays a big role in lives and sometimes a good thing optimism is a good thing 
yeah no so again i say is a really serious problem we need to have a price on carbon 
the price of gas more someone else comes along and says worry technological innovation will solve once again got 
better message right so optimistic americans we believe in technological progress so just wait technology will solve the problem 
the thing is sometimes it does right again not crazy but do you sit around and wait for the 
technology or do you take some steps in insurance right so a third and then the third thing is 
subject of my new book so shameless plug chuckle sc no no why here no yeah yeah so erik 
and i have just started working on a new project which is really an attempt to answer this question 
does this argument about freedom freedom freedom regulation is bad bad bad the market is good why does that 
have so much resonance with the american people when in fact we know that markets fail pick up any 
economics textbook market a real thing great depression of housing bubbles tulip crisis lots and lots of examples of 
failure small and large throughout the entire history of capitalism so the idea of market failure be a big 
and yet somehow it is we somehow assimilate the idea that yes markets are often efficient but sometimes they 
and sometimes really badly sc well and a failure of the market is sort of a failure on its 
terms to make its people money it even work at that but also just markets causing bad outcomes no 
the second thing so the first thing is markets failing even on their own terms like a housing bubble 
then the second thing is what economists call the market could be functioning well as a market but not 
for some damaging effect and climate change is that right so buying and selling oil gas fossil fuels by 
not necessarily a bad thing until we discover that this really serious unintended side effect and called an and 
this economics textbook this is no secret and yet somehow we operate and we talk and we speak as 
external costs well external somehow they count because external to the market and that make sense no and then 
whole freedom thing because of course we want freedom of course freedom is a good thing but there are 
freedoms my freedom to do certain things impinges on your freedom to do other things i have the freedom 
dump my garbage in your backyard so why should you have the freedom to dump your garbage in the 
and yet the first one we know is no good right you could have me arrested if i came 
dumped my junk on your lawn but somehow the freedom of corporations to dump pollution in the atmosphere well 
some limits on that but not as many as we need so these are issues of competing freedom and 
a big philosophical literature about this isaiah berlin once famously said that for wolves can be death for chuckle 
i used that line once at a conference at yellowstone and i thought maybe not the best metaphor to 
chuckle no always looking for those good metaphors but metaphors are very socially contingent anyway so the point is 
are all things that can be discussed need to be discussed and we have a framework through which we 
discuss them and yet somehow that happened instead we have this really pervasive cultural story about the efficiency of 
the magic of the marketplace that makes it very easy to persuade people let the markets handle it and 
the government interfere government is bureaucratic government is inefficient government is and so erik and i became interested in 
to figure out did that story come and especially the government piece because good we need government the reason 
have government is if we life would be nasty brutish and short right sc not what ronald reagan taught 
no right but the point reagan was all about the problem not the so we became interested in trying 
figure out where that came from especially because if you think about the founding fathers this country was built 
the premise of good governance that government is essential and we wanna do it right and not just put 
in the hands of a monarch or a dictator but have a kind of structure that will ensure that 
goes forward in a reasonable manner that the majority rule but with respect to the views of minorities all 
good things but yet somehow again lost that and now in this thing we just think of government as 
bad sc and somehow the explanation has to involve the fact that this divergence of attitudes happens over time 
also more in the united states than in other similar western countries not just purely a human psychological reaction 
correct and a really important point right exactly very local because climate change denial now is essentially an american 
it exists a little bit in a few other places but not much sc probably listening to us right 
exactly well in australia we know it came from the united states and was pushed out to australia but 
france germany switzerland china brazil climate change denial is just not a thing argentina chile japan tanzania so this 
a very particularly american story and so any explanation there has to be about that so this is one 
why a little skeptical of the human psychology analyses yes of course a psychological component certainly true but that 
why of germans accept that climate change is real irrespective of whether conservatives or liberals and yet in the 
states of republicans right so this is a cultural thing that needs a cultural explanation sc my very first 
guest was carol travers who is a social psychologist and we talked about cognitive biases cognitive dissonance tribalism and 
when you pick a side driven to ex post facto invent reasons to support your side is there some 
effect that when people from the george marshall institute were effective enough in getting some policy makers to buy 
this picture then that sort of shifted the political discourse in a way that the country followed along no 
and i think definitely true definitely and i think where the psychological elements do come in but at the 
time if you are looking to change the situation then the tribal story really help you figure out how 
change it very well but if you remind people republicans always think like you say if we go back 
nixon and bush they were proenvironment and a long history of republican environmentalism in this country so part of 
goal is actually to find some way to recreate that spirit of republican environmentalism which i actually agree with 
strongly and i go back and i read gifford pinchot like where are you chuckle no or even more 
i spent a bit of time at the library of congress a few months ago in the papers of 
train who was the first head of the council of environmental quality under richard nixon what a great man 
of his speeches you could dust them off and you could use them right now and they would still 
pertinent and he talks about all the reasonable things that it seems to me we should be talking about 
is a serious problem it go away by ignoring it or pretending it exist but we wanna find efficient 
to deal with it he was a great man he was involved in a lot of different forms of 
well he got interested in environmentalism initially through wildlife conservation like africa big game conservation but he also talked 
how ordinary people have the need to be in beautiful places and after the urban riots in the he 
a big speech in which he showed that some of the commissions that had looked into the causes of 
riots people had talked about the fact that they have parks in their communities they just even have a 
where they could sit under a tree sc right no so it just about preserving elephants but it was 
about just the way in which nature and natural environments are important to people on a daily basis and 
saw that and i thought a great great man his notion of conservation is so capacious that it ranges 
protecting the elephants in africa to making sure that people in watts have i was like russell where are 
laughter sc well speaking of shameless plugs another recent podcast guest was joe walston of the wildlife conservation society 
he makes the case that almost all environmental movements started in cities the people who miss being out there 
the environment that become activists about trying to protect it and cautiously optimistic that a new equilibrium in our 
if we can get enough people to live in cities then we can leave nature alone and it can 
rebound a little no well interesting well i hope right but certainly true right if you live out in 
country or a rural area easy to take it for granted but with the rise of urbanization the original 
movement in the united states with gifford pinchot john d rockefeller teddy roosevelt was all about responding to urbanization 
the impacts they thought that had on american life sc so when you go back into the past looking 
these things i know this is part of your new book do you have a title for the new 
by the way no yes called the magic of the marketplace the true history of a false idea sc 
good yes and is this gonna last i know publishers always want to mess with your title so is 
set in stone no i know well never set in stone but our publisher really likes this title so 
that this one has a good chance of surviving yeah sc so you go back i just heard you 
about this yesterday for those who are listening i know now you go back and a long history in 
united states of this battle between corporations and the government trying to regulate them a little bit right and 
labor is one of them and i was struck by the fact that maybe the first incident on your 
was the emancipation right no yes sc and for many reasons one of which reminds me this is still 
original sin of the united states so many things go back to the fight over slavery no yes well 
and i threw that in to be deliberately provocative the book is going to focus on the century not 
to talk about slavery but it is really important to recognize that the marketplace gave us slavery right and 
extreme example but an important one because a reminder that we actually consider it acceptable to buy and sell 
things we do put limits always placed limits on the marketplace and the great fight of the century in 
country which we are still dealing with is that some people thought it was legitimate to buy and sell 
people and other people and so we had to make a choice and that a choice that the market 
itself could solve right there was no magic of the marketplace to resolve the problem of slavery and ultimately 
was the federal government that put an end to slavery through the emancipation proclamation so an extreme example but 
think sometimes those extremes are important for us to kind of put to frame the problem and then in 
book i think we probably talk about slavery it would be kind of a diversion but we will start 
the debate over child labor and i think a really great example because almost no one in the united 
today would defend child labor sc right no although interestingly enough i actually did a little googling to see 
i could find someone who did and out there sc i would have predicted that no out there sc 
no sc they will send you emails after your book comes out no they probably will although this particular 
i found was actually someone relatively prominent who defended it in third world countries on the grounds that they 
it because so poor which i think has the argument backwards i think you get out of poverty through 
and you educate your children if working in factories but nevertheless the point is the vast vast majority of 
would not sanction child labor and so important for us to realize that well but we had to fight 
that because the free market sanctioned child labor and so how do we end child labor through regulation through 
that said no and it starts modestly it starts with restrictions for children under it starts with certain industries 
mining staggering to think that in the century you had fouryearolds fiveyearolds sixyearolds working in mines and those children 
none of those children made it to adulthood so today we consider that socially acceptable sc and one of 
things he said was that it was more dangerous to be a child working on the railroad than to 
fighting in world war i no yeah that a scary thought sc yeah no yeah sc but it did 
and you know your example of the foreign countries child labor in foreign countries makes me think that there 
kind of an interesting game theory aspect to this like if your philosophy is you should let every individual 
every family do whatever they want then sure there will be circumstances under which an individual family is forced 
send their kids to labor because that makes them more money but you can also imagine changing circumstances so 
that is not the best thing for them and that kind of logic leads you directly to say that 
need some kind of intervention in the market no correct and i think invoking game theory is useful here 
a reminder that you can end up in a race to the bottom and in a sense that was 
happened with manufacturing in this country early on when when states first tried to pass laws the manufacturers objected 
they said be disadvantaged relative to the state next and that was true right so why ultimately we needed 
legislation to create a level playing field so that a company that hire child labor be disadvantaged against another 
that did sc but but also a little optimistic side of it which is that we have child labor 
more we correctly got rid of that and another great example is smoking of course and secondhand smoke you 
on airplanes anymore and that was the example of a fairly rapid transition from no this is my absolute 
how could you ever no correct i know and so a great example because a reminder that things can 
and sometimes they change faster than we might expect and my hopeful conclusion about climate change we are in 
pretty bad spot right now wasted thirty years really behind the eight ball particularly in terms of technological innovation 
a lot of useful time but at the same time we also know that if we really commit to 
reject denial get serious about doing something then things can happen pretty quickly and particularly once technological innovation gets 
then it can have a kind of positive feedback effect no and you see that already here in california 
me just coming back to visit having been living in massachusetts for the last five years there are so 
more electric cars here than there are in massachusetts and some of that is weather but a lot of 
is the social contagion of your got a tesla and starts raving about what a great car it is 
how much money saving and you think well i could do that too or maybe i afford a tesla 
i can get this what is it the bolt that has a three hundred mile range to it and 
begin to talk about it and it begins to seem plausible and then because there are more electric cars 
charging stations which then makes it more feasible and then in a virtuous cycle sc and certainly with solar 
there have been several articles recently about trying to explain how it came to be the fact that solar 
has gotten so much cheaper so quickly and the answer is well you put a lot of effort into 
it both because of incentives and also because of demand and really changed the picture of it no exactly 
the regulatory incentives make a big difference been some good work on this that one of the key items 
helped contribute to the decline in the cost of solar power was the german feedin tariff because when so 
passed a law saying that any consumer who generated solar power would be guaranteed that they could sell it 
the grid and be paid for it when that happened a lot of consumers wanted to do it then 
that there would be a market some of the big companies like siemens then got involved in solar power 
once you get a big company involved then the sc a big market no right then the market starts 
work right the efficiencies of scale and stuff but you needed that boost that initial incentive and the guarantee 
market share or not guaranteed but the likelihood of market share through the regulatory structure and then once the 
gets going off and it is efficient enough and it does work well but often you need some kind 
boost to get it over the initial hump sc well and also you made the point that this picture 
either the market or central planning and if the battle then you can easily see why people would favor 
market because the market is really good at finding clever solutions to you know maximizing whatever trying to maximize 
the government can play a role without central planning in figuring out what you should be no exactly and 
feedin tariff is a beautiful example because hardly totalitarianism to live in a country where you have a feedin 
laughter and in fact they have feedin tariffs in texas sc there you go so what would you say 
learned strategically from all this in terms of the battle about climate change is very far from over obviously 
looking back into the origins of this contrarianism and so forth does that suggest in any way that those 
us who believe that climate change is a real problem should be acting no well a big question of 
but i guess the main thing that i always come away with is the realization that if you want 
have change social technological cultural change in an issue that involves scientific evidence where the science plays a large 
or the whole part of making the case for why this change is needed then you have to do 
together the science and the social change have to work hand in hand not enough just to give people 
information because if they like that information then all the psychological factors we already talked about kick in but 
you give them the science then no reason then like why should i even be bothering about and the 
story is the clearest evidence of that so we did get social change in tobacco and it was a 
of scientific evidence that clearly showed smoking killed people including their innocent children and bartenders and flight attendants but 
you had a social movement to communicate that information it really the scientists who drove the social change right 
no no it was groups like the american cancer society who had advertising campaigns the surgeon general and also 
that began to pass ordinances to ban smoking in public places lawyers who took on lawsuits to file suit 
the tobacco industry so a whole set of different groups of which science was an important part it was 
crucial part but it do it on its own and so i think a really important lesson for scientists 
realize that scientists need to work in conjunction with activists politicians business leaders lawyers justice department officials whoever it 
right and conversely activists have to be smart about the science they have to do their homework learn the 
make sure that what they say is correct that they neither underestimate nor overestimate the threat but be honest 
what we know and i always say you have to exaggerate the threat because the truth is bad enough 
yeah and a tough lesson a little bit i think that scientists are very willing to hear what you 
to say if you say what we need is more scientific education and critical no right right sc and 
when you say we actually have to organize and get our hands dirty hard institutionally places like the national 
of sciences want to get too political right no exactly sc but if the earth is in danger then 
something needs to be done no exactly chuckle right and ralph cicerone to his credit before he passed said 
along those lines yeah it goes against the grain for scientists because been taught that we do that that 
be objective means we have to be not political and that it threatens our objectivity and most scientists just 
like politics you go into science because you like the idea of clear answers a definite answer two plus 
equals four not somewhere between three and five chuckle sc the truth will win out no the truth will 
in the end right exactly i still believe in evidence and all these good things that are all very 
and wonderful but in the real world they suffice not that not a necessary but not sufficient condition and 
really hard for the scientific community i think to really take on board in a serious way but ralph 
went through the whole ozone debate and he came around to feeling that that was the case and that 
scientific community did need to be involved because the facts speak for themselves and there are lots and lots 
people out there who want to reject the facts sc and you mentioned being objective which reminded me of 
other point i just wanted to bring up in some sense been giving grief to conservatives here right because 
are the ones who are allied with these particular denialist strategies liberals are not always perfectly rational chuckle no 
of course not but in recent years science has been much more on the side of liberalism chuckle i 
so sc i think so i wanna make both points right of course liberals could be just as crazy 
wrong and maybe i know the antivax controversy is an example no well a really important one though to 
clear about because there have been some people who have been tempted to say that antivaccination is the leftwing 
and false we have data on who opposes vaccination and it just it really line up with democrat republican 
sc a stereotype here in overlapping conversation no yeah but false false and been promoted i think by some 
who should know better i think sometimes what happens is people like ourselves who want to make the point 
course no not just conservatives but in this particular issue that dealing with for a set of cultural and 
reasons turned out to be conservatives and in principle it could be liberals too so then we look for 
example of that and so the antivaccine thing looks like it could be that because certainly marin county has 
high rate of antivaccination but the evidence actually support that no antivaccination is a kind of interesting mixture of 
christians homeschoolers hippy liberals people had some bad experience with the medical establishment in some just a lot of 
reasons that have come together and then you have celebrities who promote it so a bit of a different 
of fish but in a way good because a reminder that there can be many different reasons why people 
science studied this particular phenomenon where conservative promarket ideology has led people to reject climate science but there are 
other things that could lead people to reject science and so if and when we find liberals turning against 
then have to deal with that too sc yeah even if we try to be as fair as possible 
if you look at the political leadership in the two parties an imbalance one of them no right a 
imbalance right exactly we find in general democratic leaders telling us that climate scientists are just in it for 
money sc yeah true and so in that case and maybe the final question you mentioned that both scientific 
and political activism is the kind of strategy you need is there any more purely political legislative get the 
of the republican party on board kind of strategy here are they too invested now in this message that 
give it up even if internally they believe it no well i think they are very invested and i 
a lot of them have backed themselves into a corner but on the other hand people can change and 
little tricky using richard nixon as an exemplar of anyone because not generally viewed as one of our more 
presidents and he had a certain fatal flaw that led to his downfall but if you for the moment 
watergate from the rest of his presidency richard nixon was one of the most virulent anticommunists in american politics 
the and was famous for really unprincipled hostile attacks on political opponents famously helen gahagan who was not a 
but he accused her of and yet he was the one he went to china and he sc only 
can go to no but exactly and that was what people always said that he could do it because 
had this reputation of being so anticommunist that if anyone could do it it would be him so that 
gives us an interesting suggestion right that actually some of the most virulent climate change deniers have an opportunity 
now to do something big and actually to be heroes and even to find people like me being grateful 
them laughter no because we sc the world would be grateful no correct and so there is an opportunity 
get themselves out of sc my question is whether there is any light in between doing that but just 
political suicide within overlapping conversation no well the right the big fear nixon was president when he went to 
so he had the position to do that and obviously much more difficult for someone lower at a lower 
but not impossible to imagine a coalition of republican governors or a coalition of republican mayors or a coalition 
republican members of congress stepping out and doing this and have it not be political suicide sc allowed to 
right no allowed to dream laughter sc alright naomi oreskes thanks so much for being on the podcast no 
thanks great talking to you music i noticed that naomi oreskes never actually said what the climate consensus is 
climate change is occurring the extent climate change is due to human activity she did mention that accept that 
change is real irrespective of whether conservatives or liberals and yet in the united states of republicans right actually 
republicans and of democrats here are the results of an extensive survey of one thousand eight hundred sixty climate 
that was taken in q fraction of global warming since the mid century can be attributed to human induced 
greenhouse gases more than to to to to i so half of the one thousand eight hundred sixty climate 
think human induced increases in green house gases account for over of the temperature increase and of climate scientists 
humans are responsible for over of the temperature increase there is clearly not a consensus in terms of the 
to which humans are responsible sean caroll said that there have been articles recently about trying to explain how 
came to be the fact that solar power has gotten so much cheaper so yet solar power gotten much 
quickly modern solar power began to be used by nasa in the and grew exponentially cheaper to one thousand 
hundred seventy when the cost had decreased to one hundred dollars per watt this exponential trend continued quite smoothly 
decades down to the current thirtyfive dollars per watt with many incentives to get the cost marginally lower each 
naomi orskes said that solar power needs a regulatory structure but once the market gets going off and it 
efficient enough and it does work well but often you need some kind of boost to get it over 
initial as a continuously exponentially decreasing cost curve over decades shows however is that there is no such thing 
an initial hump and no need for an initial boost as expected germany subsidizing solar power only played a 
small but non zero role in reducing solar costs further great podcast sean is a master interviewer and i 
his consistently insightful and entertaining you forgot to add the following to your statistical analysis of the sampled climate 
believe human activity contributes to greenhouse gas emissions sean enjoying your podcast very much great range of topics thanks 
the effort you put into this how did i forget when i clearly stated all the categories of the 
scientists think human activity has caused over of the temperature increase in recent decades think it is less than 
another say it known or be known this is why orskes repeated claim of a consensus rings hollow a 
of what thanks for the reply how would you characterize the degree of agreement from this survey what kind 
survey result would constitute a consensus not a climate scientist and would appreciate your opinion you are citing data 
here are more recent statements and studies httpswwwacsorgcontentdamacsorgpolicypublicpoliciessustainabilityglobalclimatechangeclimatechangepdf httpsclimatenasagovscientificconsensus dr hurd none of the links you cite is about 
i posted what do the climate scientists think about the extent of human activity causing the increase in global 
temperature that would not have changed much since there are also about one hundred other questions asked of climate 
pingback podcast and a dessert teresa robeson ms oreskes wrote a piece a few years ago claiming that climate 
that thought renewable energy was highly unlikely and we need to support nuclear power were ms oreskes referred to 
as a form of because they trust marc work i suppose which she seems to or at least did 
her form of article was published perhaps you would be willing to have joshua goldstein as a guest on
