but not so much because easier to make rna than dna it because rna a rigid rod dna is this double helix that winds around itself and forms a long rod rna is generally just one strand and so wigglier and it can do more sc yeah okay db so actually
not so much because easier to make rna than dna it because rna a rigid rod dna is this double helix that winds around itself and forms a long rod rna is generally just one strand and so wigglier and it can do more sc yeah okay db so actually today
so much because easier to make rna than dna it because rna a rigid rod dna is this double helix that winds around itself and forms a long rod rna is generally just one strand and so wigglier and it can do more sc yeah okay db so actually today dna
much because easier to make rna than dna it because rna a rigid rod dna is this double helix that winds around itself and forms a long rod rna is generally just one strand and so wigglier and it can do more sc yeah okay db so actually today dna looks
