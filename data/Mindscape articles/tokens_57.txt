and welcome to mindscape your host sean carroll and today we are going to hell sure that some listeners 
at least some people who know about the podcast have long been convinced that i personally am going to 
but today take a slightly more academic or at least scholarly look at the idea of what hell is 
it came from why it came to be supposed to be going on there what people think about it 
now guest marc de villiers is a canadian writer written nonfiction books about many different things about history about 
about the environment about ecology and for whatever reason he decided to become interested in the idea of hell 
let me be very very clear i know we have a broad audience this is a conversation between two 
who are completely convinced that hell is not real okay not actually sitting down and wondering whether or not 
might really exist we both kind of take for granted that it and i know that not everyone agrees 
that so apologies if not speaking to you about this issue sc but from this point of view of 
who believe in hell the fact that so many people do is fascinating right why did we invent this 
was it about human nature that made us think that there should be a place where you went to 
suffer eternal torment if you were bad a very very dramatic kind of thing and not as if even 
the modern world belief in hell is restricted to of extremist people most people in the united states believe 
hell is real most religions whether not just christianity but also islam judaism hinduism buddhism most religions in one 
or another has something we would recognize as hell for that matter polytheistic religions pagan religions long before monotheistic 
came on the scene had this kind of idea so what brought that about what does it tell us 
human beings sc and of course fun to think about the psychology the history the sociology but also a 
of wonderful little details anecdotes stories because hell is a great place to place a story as we mentioned 
the podcast inferno is a much more compelling and popular story than paradiso is hell is just kind of 
more interesting compelling place than heaven is even if you wanna go to heaven and not to hell alright 
gonna learn a lot about that i learned a lot from this as much as not personally religious the 
of religious thought i think is both fascinating and important because it really does tell us something about human 
and how they perceive of their own place in the wider cosmos so go music sc marq de villiers 
to the marq de villiers well thank you for inviting me sc this is certainly one of in my 
one of those fun topics that gonna be talking about here the nature the origin the present status of 
hell and damnation what inspired you to write a book about this topic mv well fascinated by the association 
people who are articulate and sensible and the views that they nevertheless able to hold my favorite example was 
write put it in the book was galileo who has a reputation in our world anyway as being a 
in rebellion against obscurity obscurantism and yet he spent quite a long while calculating how far beneath the surface 
would be based on the notion of that at naval is the actual center of the earth and the 
size of satan and he calculated that hell is therefore the dome of hell is therefore six hundred fifty 
beneath the surface of the earth and he announced these findings in great triumph to an audience of clerics 
wow mv and there he is an eminent scientist but nevertheless he happened to hold he was able to 
these bizzare and contradictory beliefs in his head at the same time so what interested me most about it 
think at first sc i know that about galileo i knew some of the things about isaac newton spent 
lot of time on biblical exegesis later in life and so forth mv yeah oh yes newton was another 
scientist who had some completely lunatic ideas but not that uncommon chuckle sc not that uncommon in fact when 
about galileo it reminds me probably plenty of work being done in modern science which is of the form 
believe this thing then see the consequences of but the thing that believing will later be seen down in 
future history to be completely silly mv yes i think definitely true but then our now era of course 
are just as credulous and just as conflicted as they were then i mean i read this morning that 
biden was now sacred jihadist plotting to take over the government of the us sc i know that was 
part of his new platform chuckle mv not part of this press release but they are conspiratory theories who 
believe almost anything sc yeah and it is a fascinating thing that was why the very first episode of 
that i did was with carol tavris a social psychologist and we talked about how people can justify their 
beliefs mv well yeah sc but today talking about what some of the subjects of those beliefs are so 
do wanna get into the origin story of hell and so forth but just get our bearings with a 
survey of the present situation how many people believe in hell is it universal among religions or some exceptions 
well almost all religions have a hell or many hells and some of the burmese hells for example there 
hells in burmese buddhism one for each sin sc a lot of sins mv and obviously some of those 
are going to be fairly trivial because for example borrowing books and not giving them back pretending lost them 
own hell sc uhoh mv which i find actually sort of reasonable and people who lie about their ages 
they get married has its own hell people who throw broken pottery on the fences has its own hell 
there seems in chinese buddhism it seems a little unfair but people with irregular teeth have their own hell 
which seems really unfair sc that does seem unfair well unless their own fault for bad dental hygiene mv 
well true it reminds me of the story from the new testament where jesus kept casting out demons from 
and there were lot of demons in the new testament homeland seemed aptly thick on the ground with demons 
at least once as we know the gathering of swine he cast these demons in out into poor pigs 
seems again really unfair and would certainly get peta on his case these days sc what did the pigs 
do to you mv animal cruelty people sc yeah chuckle so good almost all religions have it or the 
just today again to get our bearings are most religious believers buying into this mv in most recent gallop 
people who believed in religion in the united states had actually increased in the last decade or so from 
around to somewhere approaching more people curiously believed in hell than actually believe in heaven which is seemed to 
an indication of the peculiar nature of american politics in canada where i live the belief in hell is 
about to believe in hell where almost everybody believes in heaven so more optimistic sc draw the conclusion yeah 
we can draw okay mv but generally in europe also more people believe in hell than believe in heaven 
days which is i find interesting sc wow so both sort of universal between religions and at least a 
fraction of people in all the religions actually buy into it so chuckling here at this belief but this 
very very widely held mv yes very widely held and interesting and across religion almost every religion with some 
some interesting exceptions believe in hell and even those religions such as most variance in buddhism which have a 
believe in hell and some of the buddhist hells are grotesque in their litany of punishments there are some 
for example the hebrews and the modern jews not very good at hell i mean jews are good at 
things presumably but they are not very good at hell jewish hell is a really boring thing everybody goes 
sheol and good or bad evil or virtuous they all go to the same place and the jewish faith 
more interested in the hereandnow than in the after world which i sc been my impression that they have 
nearly the detailed picture of what comes after as christians or muslims do mv no because no belief in 
eternality of the soul for one thing so when dead dead and so better to concentrate on the here 
now than the way you might be after the candle is snuffed out sc yeah so i really liked 
part of your book where you talk about some of the origins of hell and more generally in the 
right it sort of crept up on us in some way there was first some belief in that there 
some kind of afterlife and then it could have kind of got elaborated on as time went by mv 
think where it started probably was in the early animists days when people needed an explanation of why things 
why a perfectly competent hunter fellow was killed by a perfectly normal and unaggressive animal there had to be 
reason for that it just happen and therefore demons came into the equation as an explanation for things going 
so i think the second thread of hell was it seemed that life it seemed in when civilization moved 
the urban era that life just seemed unfair and it seemed that murderers and adulterers and embezzlers who should 
punished seemed to prosper much more than seemed decent and so you had to find some way of finding 
a way to punish them when they were dead it had to be after they were dead because it 
clearly nobody was punishing while they were here sc yeah mv so another way of inventing another reason for 
i think the third thread of why people invented hell was as what former episcopal bishop simone called a 
control which is basically a way of imposing discipline on the adherence to a religion and threatening them with 
when they follow the injunctions of the hierarchy so i think those three things together in a more modern 
of hell they are slightly contradictory because if a place of punishment and therefore satan and the devil are 
of justice or a way ordinary citizens sort of getting their own back which satan is an agent of 
in that sense sc yeah mv but on the other hand many of our religion i think in christianity 
satan as the willful and rebellious angle of god called lucifer who was punished and banished into the pit 
for him and so you have this contradictory things where satan is either a victim of his own hubris 
i put it in the book and he seemed to be an ambitious lad trying to take over the 
business from dad who was the god or he was either that or he was an agent holding the 
doers to account and the monotheisms have not really got this sorted out the internal contradictions sc yeah i 
as part of the get into this i think but there once you have these supernatural beings with enormous 
and you try to use them as explanatory agents there are sorts of contradictions that you run into right 
the devil being both useful to the cosmic battle and also an agent of mischief is definitely one of 
mv yeah as expressed in many of the kind of establishment views of hell in christianity like for example 
famous one where satan is at the inner most pit of hell imprisoned in ice and therefore eternity and 
somehow he is able to roam the universe fomenting mischief and with malice of fore thought so how these 
things play out is in most denominations elated really because they think about contradictions too much sc but the 
of hell as a punishment i got the impression from your book that was a later addition to the 
that there was an afterlife in greek mythology and so forth there was still an after life but it 
not punitive in the same sense mv right well even going very early into civilization the ancient ancient ancient 
believed in an afterlife and you had to as predictable in europe in egypt you had to get there 
floating down a river and crossing through gates and so on but those who failed to make the cut 
there was a being called the devourer of souls who were standing by to grab hold of those people 
failed to prove their virtuousness but he just devour the soul so if you failed that test if you 
to pass the gates you simply disappear there was no punishment you were just dead you were ended sc 
what was the nature of the test was it a moral virtue test mv yes yes sc okay mv 
were judges who assessed how you had behaved during your lifetime sc got it mv and there were people 
were exempt from this tests and those were the no surprise here the priests and the royal family they 
to they we automatically assumed to be virtuous sc very clever yes mv very nice hedge laughter sc well 
and that same attitude was adopted by many of the later cultures in the early mesopotamian cultures like the 
culture and the canaanites pretty much had the same thing when you were dead you went to a place 
for you but there was no punishment there you were just there and in most cases after a while 
simply died and the same thing was in all of the old african cultures which i particularly am fond 
where you became if you were good you became a revered ancestor and if you to be forgotten by 
living was hell enough they were and they were so many dead then sc probably impossible to answer but 
people at least speculate about who is the first person to suggest that life continued after death or where 
that idea pop up on the scene mv very early but we know it goes back to at least 
in the ancient egyptian cultures the occult of osiris was one of the earliest and certainly that goes and 
lot of speculative evidence speculative i wanna call it evidence but speculations anyway that the early stone age cultures 
gathering cultures also believed that there that you were able to survive death if you succeeded in a series 
assigned tasks and those tasks were dictated by your family and also your tribe and your clan and so 
think the notion that there was that you die went back almost as early as the search for causality 
the universe as a search for the reason why things happened it must have been a reason for something 
must been a reason for thunder it must be the gods stumbling across the cloud so it was a 
short step from that to believing that there were supernatural beings to believing that well under the right circumstances 
could join them sc yeah and certainly interesting there is that even before we officially had hell as distinct 
heaven we had this idea of judging right very clear that the whole set up is very much in 
to human beings desire to find reasons why things happen and justice and fairness in dealing with them somehow 
we do it here on earth say that the after life takes care of it mv right exactly and 
have to rely on the judges to deeply know the inner lives of the souls who appeared before them 
they would know if you sinned during your life and they would know how you sinned and they would 
whether you repented and they would judge you accordingly and in the ancient greek hades the mythology of hades 
were three levels it was a field of asphodel which everybody rank while they waited for the judge and 
there was elysium which you went to if you where judged to be virtuous and then there were tartarus 
was the inner most pit and flames of hell and hellfire and where it was from the greeks would 
this notion that torture was very much a part of the after life the egyptians they heed to that 
in later dynasties in egypt people were cut up and flayed and boiled and minced and skinned and everything 
it the point the punishment the point was just to get you dead the greeks developed this into a 
more systematic thing mv but even the greeks have eternity you could that was after the christians and the 
too introduced the notion that hell was an ending that eternity was part of the formula sc well interesting 
guess it makes sense i realized that but in this shift from polytheism to monotheism a lot of things 
were finite become infinite in some way you had a bunch of flawed individuals being your gods in polytheism 
then everything is sort of perfect and everlasting up there in the sky or down below once you become 
mv and in polytheism they had these quarrelsome families of gods and what happened to you could swerve and 
on its heel if a different god was prevailed on a different day so if a storm god was 
than the god of agriculture your crops fail on the other hand in some cases the god of agriculture 
able to put the storm god into a hole where he belonged and your crops were wonderful so it 
easy to explain why things went wrong because whatever happened one god or either prevailed over another and the 
families of gods were constantly at war with each other and so that made sense when the ancient hebrews 
monotheism it no longer made sense that because god was infinitely able and infinitely was everlasting and he was 
impossible for him to be wrong and therefore what happened what had to happen is that we were wrong 
worshipping him or adhering to his ways in the proper fashion and therefore he was right to punish us 
they were not the fault anymore it was our fault now sc but never less there is some universality 
the idea so the greeks came up with tartarus tantalus tartarus mv tartarus sc tartarus was the place tantalus 
a person right mv yes right yes sc okay but still the hindus the buddhists i think that japanese 
religion and so forth also came up with this idea that you would be treated badly afterward if you 
bad while alive mv yes well both the hindu and the buddhist traditions hell was not openended for obvious 
because the reason you went there was not for punishment the reason you were sent there was to work 
the sins that you committed in life and once you had purged those from your system and the best 
of purging them was to be tortured for a millennia and that would certainly drive all thoughts of sin 
of your mind i would think after a short while but you were then released on parole you were 
out to start your life again and this could last for a very long time in the hindu traditions 
time you spent in hell varied from somewhere like or years to several million it seemed like it must 
seemed like eternity to those people who were consigned there but it forever sc right mv and the same 
the buddhist traditions there was an old tradition in tibetan buddhism for example where a mountain of sesame seeds 
hundred miles on a side a cube and one small bird took one seed away every thousand years and 
that mountain had disappeared then you are deemed to have purged your sins and you could be released sc 
okay this brings up a question definitely gonna ask just get it out of the way right now how 
they come up with this specific idea someone had to invent that at some point and do you think 
they were they knew they were just inventing it or do they think that they were working it out 
did they think that there was a revelation mv i think this remains a mystery because at the same 
of credulity that we still face with now and we face with the supernatural stories started and then they 
embellished and one monastery was competing with another and one monk was telling tales that were more uptodate and 
modern and more lurid than the previous monk and i think there was a competitiveness in what we would 
call fake news that they out did each other but nobody knows who actually invented these buddha himself somebody 
him as real and he had a long listing of the tortures a rather enthusiastic listing of the tortures 
which sinners would be subjected mv but he also like all of his followers believed that in the end 
would prevail and you would be able to work your way through your sins and purify yourself and then 
would be bathed in the river of forgetfulness and you would start the whole process again and that where 
endless numbers of millenia came from i think there was a japanese monk called genshin who had as i 
in the book only a hazy idea of cosmological time who suggested that ten trillion years might be about 
for the average sinner to escape and nobody as far i know has topped that laughter sc get some 
on the scene i think we can top that but i also wonder whether the audience for these stories 
the time take them like okay sesame seeds etcetera now imagining that it was a doctrine handdown from one 
but at the time it was just a fun story mv i think that both of those aspects are 
i think it was a story that they could be thrilled with and also it was a way of 
in people who succeeded them their children and their families a way of threatening them with punishment if they 
up so i think both of those things happen in a way i think almost certainly nobody thought towards 
my god if i behave now gonna be in there for two trillion i think anybody actually thought that 
just said gonna be chuckle sc yeah gonna be bad mv yeah gonna be bad then hellfire is gonna 
me and then knives are gonna get me and gonna be immersed in noxious and obscene liquids yeah gonna 
bad but get out of and i think they definetely believed that something was gonna happen yeah the sc 
so there are definitely stories being told but some of those stories were stories about eye witness testimony a 
of visiting hell the ancient greeks had orpheus and so forth mv right sc and the christians have their 
story mv aeneas was there and if you look at the medieval period which is where most of most 
imaginings of hell came from in christianity it seemed at one point virtually every literate monk or nun had 
visited hell or had been vouchsafed hell in a vision or talked to somebody who was there and could 
for the veracity of everything and the stories were actually remarkably similar i guess not surprisingly because they fed 
each other but dark gloomy hellfire that gave off no light fire that burned but destroy hellfire destroy people 
it would be beside the point it would be over too soon sc right mv so it had to 
you but you die of it and there was in some some of the visions medieval visions of hell 
very sharp big crows who were standing by to drag your entrails out through your anus well they were 
versions for sure and think okay well after a while you sort of run out but laughter sc you 
only have so many entrails mv apparently not these sister were endlessly self renewing and part of the interesting 
peculiar physics of the netherworld sc and if you can go visit like aeneas and and virgil maybe mv 
virgil yes sc it has to be located somewhere i thought it was very funny in your book you 
through all the places where hell might be found it nearly as conceptual as you might think of it 
you might actually find the entrance if you looked hard enough mv oh yes well the early romans knew 
where it was it was just off mount etna and a grotto there which gives off what are called 
gases which are poisonous gases and people had noticed that birds that flew past it or that cows that 
into it keeled over dead and so that obviously was a place it was the antiroom to hell and 
was inhabited by one of the nastier sibyls and the gorgons so that was one but there were many 
there was one in vernon there was one in greece there is also one in turkmenistan and as i 
a johnnycomelately hell was thought to be beneath lough derg in ireland mv because saint patrick found it there 
had reported that he had been given a tour and there are many others one off the coast on 
west side of the gulf of mexico the essex had an entrance to hell there but a very popular 
is in china in the city of fengdu which was visited by numerous people governor kwoh of one of 
provinces was lowered into it on a rope and he spend a nice time in hell and was given 
nice cup of tea while they explained the management of the system to him and the city of fengdu 
been known actually for one thousand five hundred years been a repository of hellish law mv the artisans of 
are widely thought to be prosperous because they manufactured instruments of torture which they then sold to the denizens 
the underworld and unfortunately fengdu was drowned in the rising of the waters of the three gorges dam so 
they still have a theme park there which you can visit if you will laughter sc i suppose if 
is down there why should we be surprised that multiple entrances to it it just makes things easy little 
more efficient mv and almost over the gate a gated community like heaven is generally and you had to 
famous injunction all hope he who pass through but almost all the ancient egyptians had seven gates the zoroastrians 
eight i think if i recall correctly and pretty well everybody had at least one gate you had to 
through the legend of ishtar descending into the underworld to visit her sister she had to pass through eight 
and losing an item of clothing in every one she was forced to appear before her who was a 
unpleasant goddess called ereshkigal who impaled ishtar on a meathook until the gods up above came and rescued her 
there are always gates and sometimes there are bridges you have to cross in order to get into hell 
are these gates keeping people out or in mv always keeping people out because chuckle when your time has 
you you enter hell until your time was ready except aeneas was able to go in and of course 
was able to use virgil to get him in so there were passwords you could use and people you 
use that were able to get you in but nobody ever tried to escape because you get out that 
of the plan sc interesting they would try to keep people out i am very interested in how the 
evolves obviously in someone like dante it becomes huge but as you mentioned in the book if you read 
jewish bible the old testament almost no talk of hell or satan or anything like that and more of 
in the new testament and even more in the quran so people definitely became more interested in the details 
the way mv i think as hell in christianity became more embedded in the system the further away from 
we got the more grotesque the punishments of hell became but it really until the early medieval times when 
church was beginning to face competition from early free thinkers and also later on of course from calvin and 
and they felt themselves to be under attack by people who were not as controllable as they should be 
that point hell became even more severe and satan turned from an agent of god and a guardian of 
dead into something evil and malevolent who would grasp you if you behave mv if you adhere to the 
of the church if you listen to your bishop if you follow the threads that they told you to 
if you were a protester or protestant as it became later then hellfire would get you for sure the 
syndrome as the witch trials of europe in the and century became more and more aggressive the more that 
church felt itself under attack from dissenters and so no wonder for example that germany where many of the 
dissenters began there were more witches that burned and hanged in germany than in any other place so predictable 
the hierarchy of the church exaggerated and made more appalling the punishments that awaited you if you adhere to 
proper way of doing things sc if we just stuck to the new testament or even just to the 
can we say anything about what the early church or what jesus would have thought about hell i think 
debate on whether jesus was clear that you must go to hell mv jesus in the gospel had very 
to say about hell there were a couple of things when matthew quoted him as saying that certain people 
be consigned into the eternal flames and jesus was big on the kind of wailings and gnashings of teeth 
went on down in hell chuckle mv but he never said where it was and he never said much 
who went there and who hell at that point was really according to those stories was really an imprisoning 
for the opponents of god and it was mostly satan not so much humans it was really only as 
church grew in its stature and got further away from the writers of the gospel and the supposed sayings 
jesus himself that they started to invent the more aggressive punishment that sinners would face if they follow the 
church sc jesus did talk about heaven quite a bit and how you needed to go through him to 
through to heaven and maybe it was just assumed that not getting into heaven meant you went to hell 
i think that was the assumption and certainly the early church believed that anyone who follow jesus or was 
before jesus existed would automatically be consigned to hell and in fact one of the stories has jesus doing 
harrowing of hell that is visiting hell after he was or in some versions while he was still on 
cross going down to rescue people like adam and the first people who were in hell because they came 
him but he got them out and he was able to get them out so yeah everybody who saved 
jesus would be automatically consigned to hell sc yeah this is a fascinating story to me it comes into 
of the sets of contradictions somehow in the history of religion there are certain things you want to be 
and it might be difficult to make everything compatible with everything else so the harrowing of hell story is 
there in the gospel or at least in one i forget which book it is mv yeah although no 
detail most of the real stories about the harrowing of hell were from the apocryphal gospels or some of 
gnostic for example the gospel of nicodemus the gospel of bartholomew which were rejected by the early church fathers 
not incorporated into the canon where most of the stories of the harrowing of hell came from and there 
also some earlier versions of the stories which were in fact prehell i think called testimony of which is 
of the gnostic gospels had stood its whole tale of adam and eve and original sin on its head 
in that sense the gospel was very critical of god for grudging adam and eve the knowledge why would 
do that what a malicious grudger he was as the gospel put it and in that case the serpent 
was satan was portrayed as the sensible worldly person and god was a kind of a peevish person simply 
people who listen to him properly so there was a lot of variance on that but in the actual 
that are in the new testament actually very little about hell sc maybe worth for those who know about 
whole maybe worth just talking a little bit about how what we now consider to be the scriptures came 
it like there was one very clean process by which either the hebrew bible or the new testament were 
written down there were a whole bunch of documents floating around and some councils had to decide what was 
and what was out but the people at the time had might have read all of these stories whether 
not they were in or out mv well they i think they probably did read many of them and 
the ancient hebrew prophets were much more into apocalyptic visions than the sanhedrin or the hebrew authorities were and 
lot of those survived and were transmitted into stories that were picked up by the christians and also christianity 
freely from zoroastrianism which which had a very welldeveloped dualistic theory of a universe it was in contention between 
forces of virtue and the forces of evil sc and that was one of the first monotheistic religions that 
caught on mv yes it was the first multinational monotheistic religion i think and christianity picked up a lot 
its thoughts about hell from zoroastrianism from the greek mythologies of hades from their stories of the torches of 
and having his liver pecked out for eternity by a vulture and and these stories accreted as they went 
and then as the early few centuries of christianity proceeded they tended to agglomerate some of the early stories 
accumulate them and embellish them and by the time you got to the seventh and eighth century the time 
charlemagne for example the visions of hell had become reasonably predictable that there was it was beneath the earth 
there were cauldrons of boiling oil there was hell fire there were demons with the pitch folks and those 
worked into almost all of the visions that followed in the next few centuries except satan who became less 
less a servant of god and more and more a creature of evil as we proceeded through the centuries 
well story is more complex i think than most people think certainly more complex than i knew until i 
your book there for one thing the idea of hades which was originally the person and then it became 
place maybe with a person and then cobosses at different times and lucifer versus satan and all that mv 
where it did get very confusing because chronology is not simple sc yeah mv hades was first of all 
place and then yes hades also became the god of the underworld his brothers were zeus and poseidon and 
drew the short straw and drew the underworld and was always regarded as as horrendous to look at and 
and monstrous and which i argue in the book was a bit of a bum rap because his brothers 
just as bad his family was not an exemplary family his father was one of the titans cronus swallowed 
and some of his siblings when they were infants and zeus showing some of the leadership skills that made 
a chief god later on forced his father to vomit up the children and rescued them and then the 
banded together and prepared a pit for the titans and banished their father into this pit and that was 
earliest version of the underground place to store the bad guys sc right family is always hard laughter mv 
is always hard yeah and so the early christian early versions of christian hell started more in the same 
as a revolt against god lucifer and his cohorts were rebellious were not taking orders and god in a 
of anger again sent the angel gabriel to prepare a pit for lucifer which was basically borrowed holus bolus 
the greeks there was the same story just updated with new names and where satan came from and he 
abolished if you listen to milton and from the egyptians he borrowed not only was lucifer abolished but about 
the heavenly host went with him so as i said in the book it show much for management skills 
half of his crowd was revolting against him but anyway so both the ancient greek hell and modern hell 
with a revolt in heaven mv but hades and satan were often in many early christian writings cohabiting or 
in hell hades was the ruler of hell and satan was the prince of death and sometimes they worked 
and sometimes they and there was a fair amount of quarrels quarreling going on and there was some i 
there was one gospel of bartholomew it was wonderful in depicting the panic and the ineffectualness of both satan 
hades when jesus came down to rescue adam and they kept blaming each other for inviting him down there 
the first place chuckle mv again it seemed more ineffectual old fractures and they drew skillful evil managers of 
dead sc yeah but the early christians thought like you said both satan and hades were powerful figures in 
as far as i can tell hades has disappeared from the official doctrine mv yes hades disappeared sometimes he 
up as a name beelzebub sc okay mv but that beelzebub is derived from the mesopotamian god who has 
visited the hell to wrestle with death at some point but very confusing because no consistency beelzebub sometimes hades 
lucifer himself hades was originally the master of hell and later on was consigned to a lesser role as 
kind of inkeeper and chief and after a while he just vanished from as the roman religion was supplanted 
christianity hades and the other pantheon of the greek gods disappeared and became faded into the background sc not 
clear the relationship between lucifer and satan is that right mv well no i think pretty clear that lucifer 
satan again there are contradictions in the stories and then the other version of satan satan is as you 
know already in hebrew simply means adversary the word for adversary and he was he was originally one of 
servants of god and he was the one who goaded god into for example testing lot with the boils 
he would then try putting him through the trials of his faith it was satan and god who cooked 
this little scheme together he sc sorry was it lot or job talking about mv oh job sorry job 
job and satan was really on in the royal court he was one of the children of god so 
he was also lucifer and he was satan at the same time and it there were two quite separate 
of how that developed the christians turned him into satan and lost lucifer and some of the early christians 
well lucifer could easily be redeemed he so bad he had a bad press he could be saved and 
was a minority view that was punished by exile and casting anathema on people like origen for example who 
an early christian gadfly sc and one of these contradictions that you mentioned is the idea that in most 
the stories at least as they developed in the christian telling hell predates human kind is that right the 
of lucifer and so forth happened first and it mv yes right sc like you said used as a 
for the bad angels and then repurposed i guess as a place to keep the bad people mv essentially 
it was and there it was basically what they called the innermost pit which is where satan and lucifer 
satan aka lucifer and his cohort were imprisoned and originally it was just a hole in the relish and 
instructed gabriel to heap sharp rocks on their head and keep them in down in there so it was 
pretty primitive arrangement it was just a pit with rocks and that became much more embellished as time went 
and it seem sufficient that there would be that satan was just imprisoned in there with nothing much to 
and you needed somehow to deal with sinners you needed some way to control their actions you want to 
them enter into any more heresies than you could hear of and so yes it became in your word 
into a prison for malefactors and not just a prison for the chief the devil in chief sc and 
christians certainly had a good time embellishing and complicating the notion of hell did judaism not do that it 
not a big deal certainly in the old testament times mv no sc is there some tradition in judaism 
coming up with some stories about the afterlife mv after the babylonian captivity as people returned to israel they 
developments in this universal notion of judaism that everybody just went to sheol and it was a place where 
was no activity there was nothing to eat and nothing to do it was just dark and gloomy and 
a while the same impulses came into the judaic thought that somehow evildoers would prospering more than they should 
so sheol became divided into two a place for the sinners and a place for the virtuous and it 
a fairly would be a fairly short step from there for the evildoers to be punished and the virtuous 
be rewarded and indeed there were some streams in judaism that believed to some degree in some sectors still 
that there would be that when the messiah comes and abraham is resurrected that those virtuous would be accepted 
a world which is more bucolic and more paradisaic and the sinners would therefore just be forgotten and not 
and not tortured but just forgotten sc forgotten whereas on the other side of things islam comes along at 
time when the idea of hell is already pretty fully developed and as far as i can tell they 
to it enthusiastically mv enthusiastically and they have a number of rather inventive embellishments the diet of hell a 
root which if you pour it from the sap if you pour a drop of the sap on the 
it would poison all life on earth well the sinners are forced to drink that and of course they 
it and then they would resurrect it immediately afterwards also they were very good muhammad himself was very good 
the ways that you could in fact torture people without them dying pouring incredibly hot boiling liquid on top 
their heads and then it would run through the body and pool out at their feet that was one 
his favorites and then of course once it was out you would be resurrected and the whole process would 
all over again but diet was much more an interesting facet of islamic hell i see anything and anybody 
or anybody who suggested what you might actually eat sc yeah mv nobody got that far but islam was 
good on that sc and how go ahead mv and and in hell fire the christian fire still remain 
hottest furnaces of all in islam you use fire consistently and mostly to burn off the skin that was 
they were interested in more they interested that much into mincing and cutting and then that was left with 
buddhists to get into that sort of thing the christians would get into boiling in oil but they like 
was part of what islamic thought would be appropriate punishment in hell sc and i would imagine that in 
of these mature religions both a set of stories and things that people tell each other and then sort 
the official doctrine how much of the specific story of hell and who is the boss in it and 
lives there and what happens to you there is embedded the catholics are probably the best at writing things 
right but in in any of these religions mv yeah but even so very little not in the catechism 
not in the official doctrines of the catholic church but in the writings of the jesuits of the writings 
early bishops adamnan for example who was a famous irish bishop of i think the century the embellishments came 
the canon generally and so they adopted from each other they adapted from each other and they embellished on 
other and work and but very little was in the catechism of the catholic church itself does say that 
is an actual place where actual sinners are going to be actually tortured but they get into the specifics 
that left for the commentary the commentariat sc and there a rumor going around that pope francis had mentioned 
an interviewer that maybe hell in fact literal that way mv yeah i think the catholic church has backed 
from this still in the catechism but francis for example said that hell is simply a radical separation from 
which is a much more intellectual and not physical version of catechism sc not so much burning there mv 
so much burning there i know it was selftorture in a sense and the vatican rapidly backpedaled when he 
quoted as saying this with a italian journalist but it have surprised anybody if he had said it the 
is skeptical of the literal interpretations of gospel these days and that should be their view it should be 
to some degree as metaphor and to some degree as an explanation but not to be taken as literally 
it used to be taken i think quite common in the catholic church even now sc yeah so i 
actually did research for this podcast interview that is to say i went on to google and i asked 
the current beliefs were easy to find opinion polls at least in the us worldwide probably a different story 
what i found was that right now of americans believe in heaven maybe falling very very slowly but not 
are believing in hell and been consistent for at least ten years but i think it is higher than 
used to be and interestingly so of americans believe in hell but among american buddhists among american hindus and 
americans who have a religious affiliation is so mv so the astonishing thing you could believe in hell if 
religious sc yeah it certainly serves some purpose there mv because very convenient a convenient concept to have a 
because it explains so much sc well and of americans believe in satan and that is apparently up from 
a couple of decades ago for whatever reason belief in satan is skyrocketing in the united states mv well 
people who look around and see going on in the country believe that some malevolent force must have a 
in it somehow otherwise why would it everything be so crazy got to be some explanation some reason for 
chuckle mv and satan even if you believe in hell satan is a malevolent force patrolling the universe he 
have to have a home but he is a force a controverting force to the positive force of what 
if you call it god jesus spiritualism buddha yama whatever your particular religion give you charge sc i was 
to figure out whether i should be surprised whether easier to believe in hell without satan or to believe 
satan without hell probably is easier to believe in satan without hell mv i would think so because hell 
so much specific detail about what it is what it looked like what the meteorology is like and what 
topography is like and the imps and demons that run it have to have a hierarchy a very complicated 
where satan just is a malicious spirit who could be manifest anywhere and at any time in any person 
yeah i think much easier to believe in the devil than it is to believe in his abode sc 
believing in satan certainly does help make monotheism a little bit more consistent with our experience of the world 
if there were just a single omnipotent benevolent god and no other powerful supernatural creatures he has a lot 
explaining to do mv well one of the difficulties of monotheisms and difficulties of believing in a universal loving 
just god is the explanation for evil and therefore satan is a very convenient explanation for that never quite 
out why an allpowerful allseeing and allomnipotent god has allowed the force of evil and the force of evil 
appear and to compete with him the theory is that in a sense satan is creation because it helps 
impose discipline and explain things that god himself is unable to do and so acting as agent in that 
sc yeah so just letting some of my personal opinions leak in here sure been doing it the whole 
but do it even more explicitly here yes the problem of evil in religion if god is good and 
why is there evil in the world and like so many other attempts to answer these conundrums in the 
of religious belief the idea that well also satan and that helps explain the existence of evil seems more 
a deferral than a solution right well sort of why is there satan chuckle mv yeah because it explain 
the explanation is just at one step removed that the satan causes it but what caused satan the same 
when people are arguing for the existence of god there has to be a god because who caused the 
well then you argue who caused god sc yeah mv if evil exists what caused evil if satan caused 
why does satan exist because god caused satan sc yeah mv and there must be a reason why god 
that and the reason is evil happens anyway and it seems that god is not as omnipotent and allpowerful 
the doctrine would suggest sc i think one of the reasons why we came in contact is because you 
this book and i provided a blurb for it and because i was quoted in it and the reason 
i was quoted in it is because there was this discussion started by a new york times column by 
douthat mv yeah sc where he is making the argument which not the first to make that without the 
of hell no reason to be a good person without the concept of punishment afterward anything goes and bad 
yes i think and quite common and a a very condescending view of human life it seems to me 
if automatically going to be evil unless a controlling force that forces you to be good it say much 
your spiritual development it say much for your personality it say much for your society in which embedded and 
seems that why should we why should people automatically choose to do bad things if not a control over 
activities it seems why why does ross why do people like ross douthat think that gonna automatically be evil 
not forced to be good if a good christian and in your religion you believe in a god why 
be true why you be good unless being forced to be evil but they seem to confront that they 
to you need the punishments of hell in order to be bullied into line in order to do the 
thing and that seems to be a very condescending view of humanity sc yeah i worry that being ungenerous 
because commenting on people who i disagree with but it seems worse than ungenerous to me it seems horrifying 
idea that without this eternal damnation in this particular case no reason to be a good person and that 
me think like you you think of any other reasons to be a good person other than mv because 
you confess to be an atheist and if you are in impolite or even polite company people will say 
why are doing good then why why you just go to and murder somebody because you have to worry 
any punishment in the afterlife well most people want to murder people they sc like to think that yeah 
mv right no i think it but the thing that i liked about your quoting in your essay against 
was why is there no concept of parole why is your life is only eighty years but your punishment 
eternal that just seem disproportionate chuckle sc well it does and i think that even even for heaven that 
same argument goes i think that the people who come up with these ideas their imaginations all finite human 
just very hard to stretch our imaginations to truly embrace infinity or eternity in that way how can you 
be happy and content in heaven for infinity years is something i quite understand mv well i know i 
a very brief chapter as a detour to heaven but the the historical writings on hell are much more 
and comprehensive than the writings on heaven which have a few and banal and at its best and i 
coming across this description of heaven as the throne of god surrounded by holy angels singing holy holy is 
lord our day and night for ever to they used to say the devil has the best music but 
also has a much better story to tell than that chuckle sc everyone agrees that the inferno is much 
interesting to read than the paradiso right when it comes to dante it and i think a broader thing 
on which is that human beings tend to underrate the extent to which life is about change and process 
think something perfectible about life whether buddhist or a catholic or whatever and the idea is to reach that 
state and stay there and i think that as a naturalist myself accepting that life is about flux and 
and impermanence is a much more grounded realistic way to go mv and yeah most religions are believers in 
even there was those who who do not have an eternal punishment and have a heaven the idea is 
work your way through various incarnations until you have completely purged yourself of bad doing and then you have 
one with the universe and you have become perfectible and nowhere else to go the religions really get into 
happens then because there is really no then then nowhere to go once perfectible then what sc yeah and 
i guess as one final thought from my side interesting you say about being an atheist in polite because 
is such a there is an idea of what polite company is we get it on tv and in 
media and certain ideas that are taken for granted and both sides of any one debate complain that their 
view is not represented in polite company i do think that the sort of mediaapproved version of what is 
and okay says that being atheist is worse than being religious but it also says you be really religious 
i mean it would mock you if you believed too directly in satan hell and demonic possession even though 
people do believe that mv i think fundamentalism in that sense is not polite company itself yes i think 
do not like extreme positions i think social compromises are necessary but i still think more acceptable to be 
religious than it is to be slightly unreligious sc yeah i think a valid point mv although i think 
pretty quickly i know the newer generations seem to be retreating fairly rapidly from at least from the organized 
if not from spirituality itself sc well the great thing about polite company is that it reverses itself all 
time and pretends it never has right laughter mv oh yeah and it does a universal change right it 
so yeah and a universal change right sc right mv where we are sc so i do pretty optimistic 
i know maybe optimistic is a sense of prediction but interested in the fact that people who have any 
affiliation are growing as a set of people but learned now from looking at things from your book that 
set of people who believe in satan is also increasing dramatically so going to have to try to understand 
better a little concerning to me chuckle mv yeah and the notion that exorcisms have been returning to popular 
is an interesting thing to me because demonic possession is not necessarily satan but there are people who certainly 
in that and i was fascinated to learn that you could actually now book an exorcist online there are 
number of them available for freelance exorcisms and their business seems to be flourishing sc part of me has 
for that if you believe in satan and devils and demons and then why not believe that they possess 
and you should get them exorcised almost worse to me if you sort of profess belief in that but 
really right i like consistency in my anthologies mv if you profess belief and then believe that impossible to 
and get rid of them that would be an even more depressing outcome sc that would be depressing yeah 
chuckle so a mixed message here but marq de villiers thanks so much for being on the podcast laughter 
thank you very much sean music the sumerians had a rather extensive hellunderworld for the dead but it was 
ruled in part by ereshkigal a goddess who passed judgement on the dead seems females were edged out of 
thereafter in most religions or myths sean in judaism there is no concept of hell as a place of 
torment completely foreign to jews the harrowing of hell is an excellent rescue ops story too oft forgotten the 
jeffrey burton russell did a multibook investigation of concepts of the devil in ancient cultures and the west that 
would recommend for those interested in that kind of thing the christian story of lucifer may also draw inspiration 
ezekiel over the king of this mentions an exalted one in the company of guardian angels who is cast 
into the pit arthur c clarke drew inspiration from this for his short story which was then incorporated into
