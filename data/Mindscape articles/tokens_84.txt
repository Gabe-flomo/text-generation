show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll if you 
back in the early gogo youthful days of mindscape we had geoffrey west on in episode five an expert 
complex systems and scaling from physical systems to biology to social systems and one of the things we talked 
was cities and how the fact that human beings congregate in cities is extraordinarily helpful when it comes to 
ideas innovation progress the number of patents per person is much higher in a city than in rural areas 
example not just because there are more people but even more per person sc today gonna talk about cities 
urbanization more generally as engines of actually protecting and preserving the environment so the idea is not only that 
moving into cities good for human beings we talk to each other we experience diverse possible outcomes and we 
good ideas but even better for the planet to have human beings in cities this can seem paradoxical but 
think that try to show you that not and i should say also not trying to have an agenda 
cities are the best i happen to live in a big city but i appreciate all the listeners no 
where they are farms house boats mountain tops you can listen to mindscape from anywhere you want sc today 
talk about ecology nature conservation with joe walston joe is a conservationist and naturalist at the wildlife conservation society 
he is the vice president for field conservation programs and joe spent numerous years working on conservation of nature 
africa and asia and other spots around the world so not exactly an antinature city boy but done the 
looked at how human growth has been affecting our planet obviously not all good climate change pollution are very 
real but urbanization joe claims the fact that people are being concentrated in cities gives us a new way 
live in harmony with nature really if worried about population growth for example the population of the earth is 
growing but the rate of population growth is dramatically slowing it peaked in the and much of that is 
people have moved into cities and are having fewer children there we might be undergoing a phase transition from 
exponential growth phase where just having more and more people to a new phase where a certain fraction of 
earth taken up by human settlements but mostly urban and nature and all the different species on earth can 
in harmony with us at the same time sc what gonna get into gonna talk about all those issues 
may or may not be true but certainly food for thought as a reminder you can support mindscape by 
on patreon at patreoncomseanmcarroll and i very much appreciate support thank you for all those who have pledged and 
that go music sc joe walston welcome to the mindscape podcast joe walston thanks very much sc now i 
we would begin because population is something where people talked about it right resources environmentalism urbanism all these things 
you talk about people have preexisting ideas in their head not like talking about the higgs boson where you 
just say anything so before we go back and lay the ground work why you give away the punch 
what is the sort of elevator pitch for your proposing a fairly new way of thinking about some of 
issues jw so the punch line would be that for the whole entire life of ourselves and the actual 
environmental movement the earth has been on a steady decline in terms of nature nature has been on a 
and all of conservation has been designed around merely slowing declines and we really seen any sort of indication 
anything but that continuation but just as we are really getting towards the real crux on the future of 
and the last decisions on whether have much of nature left starting actually to see the ground work for 
the foundations for a real recovery of nature and that is now within our grasp and within certainly the 
of ourselves or possibly our children and yet it is quite possible for us to ignore it and therefore 
that opportunity sc but overall an optimistic message you would say jw overall an optimistic message not a inevitable 
sc right okay so a ring that we can grasp for and maybe get it jw absolutely sc alright 
great this is something that we should all be hearing about i think why you tell us your background 
your job is right now jw sure the senior vice president for our global programs at the wildlife conservation 
so wcs was the old new york zoological society which was involved in much of the early conservation work 
north america and then some of the founders of the international conservation movement early on it has two arms 
the five zoos and aquarium in new york including the bronx zoo and central park zoo and new york 
but also has this international conservation arm and that side that i work for and i run their global 
sc and does this come out of an academic background get a phd and things like that did you 
become jw no i was always told at school you could never do wildlife or animals as a job 
that was beaten out of me very early on and i ended up interested in mathematics early on and 
actually went back into a further degree in zoology and only after i discovered other people doing zoology sc 
you always loved the animals that was an early goal jw yeah it was a very simple one always 
animals and never managed to shake it sc do you think that the mathematics has been of any help 
tell ourselves in physics certainly that the rigorous training that we give our students is useful no matter what 
end up doing jw always found it interesting easy to overstate how much it actually does truly help me 
this but occasionally useful to say so sc big fan of overstating things in that way sc all right 
then set the stage for our minds about the conventional story before we get to your story there maybe 
exaggeration but when i think of population and things like that i think that either people ignore it or 
basically have a doomselling to do right like that the population is exploding this is really bad gonna overcome 
entire earth so why would we have ever been concerned or why should we be concerned what is the 
worry jw the real worry around population links off to the consumption that obviously with increased numbers of people 
an increased level of consumption and we live on a planet with limited resources sc so consuming food and 
jw essentially nature the sc yeah consuming nature jw of natural capital to other forms of capital that really 
a consumption of nature and so whilst we all can argue about different levels of consumption and how it 
or rich and poor and inequality essentially the more unless you have any sort of insight to population growth 
difficult to be able to think about conservation and sustainable management of natural resources sc i think probably some 
intuitive feeling that the earth is finite and a bunch of people who go on forever right jw yeah 
it and we all know that and theorized in the past about where those limits are on the whole 
them wrong at different points but that mean the final endpoint which is we do live on a finite 
and and until we find some sort of stabilization of that population gonna be hard to be able to 
strategies of sustainability sc and this little controversy that we have been affecting the planet enormously right this word 
can you explain that to us jw yeah anthropocene is the word which i think has merit and holds 
as a description of a planet which is defined no longer necessarily by purely geological or even climate features 
actually is singly defined by the population of humans and their impact on the earth jw we human how 
was the human population years ago or something like that sc gonna put me on the spot for exact 
in but i mean sc yeah well very very rough order of magnitude jw yeah we have grown for 
we have spread across the world the first thing the geographical scope is quite enormous and we often forget 
how successful we have been for so long at distributing ourselves right across the planet but almost invariably across 
planet up until incredibly recently we have always lived in relative population stability of course i mean the centers 
that and there are many reasons for that not least of course that had massively high death rates which 
jw and get into more about it later on sc and keep things in control yeah jw and keep 
under control and so actually for me the distribution across all habitats and parts of the world has been 
more impressive movement of people than has the actual population increase but essentially the world has started to go 
called the demographic transition and i know if now is here the place to start describing that transition sc 
yeah go ahead and describe it jw sure very there are depending on who you are three or five 
but break it down to three stages of demographic transition the first one is where really mortality rates and 
rates have kind of kept tally with each other and on the whole that people have lots of kids 
sadly lots of kids die and been the feature of many of our societies for enormous parts of human 
jw the second phase of demographic transition is whereby we have managed to do some very important very basic 
managed to control some very prevalent diseases been able to give fresh water and livable conditions been able to 
hold of many of the drivers and control many of the drivers of that mortality rate but of course 
that phase then you have continued fertility rates you have people who traditionally still have twelve children and therefore 
have this dramatic separation between those two levels the mortality rate goes down the fertility rate stays the same 
therefore populations start to go through the roof and then of course the third phase which is that those 
communities those same societies then respond and the natural fertility rate comes down often people therefore start to choose 
invest more in fewer children sc so when you say choose this is a conscious decision or is it 
different conditions i need quite as many jw well something that could be a conscious decision so in the 
change and there are many other factors involved including ability to influence those factors which is a major influence 
that but on the whole the motivations and the incentives change and so whether in whatever part of the 
there usually comes with this an incentive to invest more in fewer children as you have greater confidence going 
be able to live sc okay stage three jw stage three sc you have five jw you could do 
you could it goes on to where actually then the population stabilizes now a fifth theory of what happens 
extreme levels like seeing maybe in a place like japan or some parts of western europe we really got 
evidence yet in a long enough time to be able to demonstrate what happens in those societies some evidence 
that those levels go people choose to have more again but actually also a similar amount of evidence at 
moment that they go down and actually seeing in many parts of the world that actually population natural population 
are going down so levels as we all know the population is going down and has a real demographic 
stable in many parts of western europe and the united states but primarily because of immigration and that factors 
into all of these arguments sc so yeah i wanna get deeper into this but an aside because i 
zooming around one of the websites you sent me to look at global population over time and the year 
thousand five hundred surprised me a little bit because there was a map of the world and all these 
countries colorcoded on how populous they were and sort of the obvious population centers in europe and asia but 
there was also a pretty deep blue in presentday mexico and it reminded us that the aztecs and maybe 
descendants of the mayans and so forth there were a lot of them we kind of got rid of 
lot them right but human beings have been very good at spreading themselves around the globe not just at 
themselves jw they have and yes and still only discovering just how successful many of these populations were both 
establishing themselves but also managing to work out ways in which to live at larger population levels and whether 
intensive agriculture or collaboration cooperation or trade or many of these other specializations many of these features of socalled 
societies but of course many of them collapsed and for a wide range of reasons sc not inevitable friends 
never inevitable this is a good humanscale thing to remember right jw absolutely absolutely and but also none of 
have at all through history ever compared to now the populations were seeing raise now and that really has 
a shift whereby we have been able to stay in some millions of people in across countries and civilizations 
some times now talking about hundreds of millions of people and billions of people and sometimes tens of millions 
people in very very small geographic areas and really novel sc and i think one of the things i 
from reading your stuff is probably in the back of my mind even though never quite articulated this i 
thought of population growth as basically a story of compound interest that there was some rate of population growth 
it grew very slowly for a long time just there was a small baseline to begin with and it 
that much and been going for a long time now so now it seems to be growing very rapidly 
that was wrong there was really not exactly an even balance but only a tiny bit of excess of 
over deaths for a very very long time and that gap that you really refer to and we can 
about this more i think right now the change that happened in society drove the death rate down long 
it drove the fertility rate down and what led to this absolute spike in the population growth rate jw 
and it is it this is where you do need demographers and you do need statisticians to be able 
explain it because it sound initially intuitive and yet when you see it so the stats always start off 
to surprise people and get attention is ask them when the rate of the human population was at its 
the increase in population rate was at its highest and people often say about now or last year or 
ten years ago and it was around about one thousand nine hundred sixtytwo the the rate has come down 
increasing around since then but that say much about actually how the absolute population has increased since and so 
is as you say it is at that gap we were phenomenally successful at different points of overcoming major 
influences on mortality rate whether it be the invention of penicillin or whether it be the understanding of just 
germ theory and being able to get over we always forget just how many people died sc yeah jw 
see them sc people used to die a lot jw people used to die a lot as you say 
cities themselves were just clusters of death in many ways we used to wipe out half the population of 
at certain times and spanish flu and all these others and so when you suddenly remove that almost in 
of in societal moments a blink of an eye the impact that has in contributing to the population suddenly 
to become more logical and rational to you sc and it from the graphs i saw it around that 
population growth rate really took off and it peaked around in the that was a fairly short window in 
it was going crazy still a little bit crazy right now but way lower now than it was in 
is that safe to say jw yeah absolutely it is way lower it is significantly lower and it was 
to and way down now and of course different over different regions but the other fascinating facts about this 
is how brilliant we were even as a global community way back well i say way back in the 
of the century and the century is about sharing discoveries this is a wonderful thing of when we did 
discover penicillin or germ theory or these others of course it get to many areas that still needed it 
suffering continued way beyond longer than it absolutely should but we should also on the other hand recognize just 
brilliant we were of distributing it worldwide and then the other thing was is how societies have ironically again 
slowly though they did respond to that change sc sure jw we recognize it for a long while we 
the implications of it for a long while and the other one which get into a bit later is 
assumed that somehow people would behave differently in different parts of the world and this is one of the 
that always been going on for many years and had no evidence to back it up before which is 
commonalities between people sc really jw lived in a many very very different cultures to the one i was 
up in and yet it was always very striking and the same cultures where both foreigners like myself and 
people i live with would always say no but my society is very different my very and it always 
and i was never convinced about it and now we see this that wherever you are in the world 
commonality between these trends happening in china happening in subsaharan africa happening in latin america are incredibly similar and 
we are a lot more similar than we are different and not just a social sound bite actually sc 
no very good to learn and that feeds into the obvious question of be a little bit more careful 
why the population growth rate is going down so a lot of factors jw absolutely sc and this fact 
it happens more or less universally in different places speaks to some universality right in what the factors are 
there like the top two or three factors that are the most important ones in your mind jw yeah 
this comes at a really interesting point of the research because i think for us my very interested in 
and maternal health for many years when we would live in africa and asia and she was always working 
understanding what are the most effective drivers to support women in greater influence over their over their own decisions 
families and children especially and what we see is whilst some attempts were very culturally specific or what the 
influence or a huge influence underestimated influence is purely the nature of urbanization sc urbanization jw urbanization what happens 
the urbanization process i often thought that urbanization is many people thought was just a feature of economic development 
i think underestimated is actually what happens in urban environments i think immediate access greater access to education to 
resources and sanitation to the ability the reduction in mortality levels and therefore the inclination to invest more the 
of education and yet the impact of a good education you can still get highly educated in many rural 
of the world and have no sort of social mobility and no chances of actually increasing that in a 
that really does open up sc more leverage for education when in a city a lot of opportunities and 
lot of diverse things that you could do jw absolutely and yet many of us have these preconceived ideas 
look at these or even slums and we look at cities and we look how filthy and disgusting they 
and we look at these bucolic scenes in the countryside and say well just take a look at those 
take a look at the stats you do not want to be poor in the countryside great for us 
we get our second houses and we want to go back and living in a high governance environment and 
but you do not want to be poor or a woman in those environments and actually the stats on 
from child mortality to abuse to rights much worse in in these areas than cities even sometimes these low 
slum areas what happens in them is fascinating the evidence of how they mobilize and change how decision changes 
how people access the ability to be able to move socially is quite stark sc and another aside but 
think one worth getting to then come back to the cities and population growth but you touched on the 
that there is a moral aspect to help people think about these things right maybe moral is even too 
but there is a romantic aspect of living in the countryside living off the land and so forth and 
who are not professional demographers or population geneticists and so forth might think that just something better about having 
people living in agrarian society like thomas jefferson would have thought this right and vice versa other people who 
that economic growth is the best and steven pinker has taught us that economic growth gets us out of 
and people object to that and back and forth how much of so number one how much of this 
you have to confront when talking about this and talking to other people number two how much work do 
have to do to control your own cognitive biases this way and make sure not just figuring out the 
you want then saying what we should jw yeah well of course i have complete access to the truth 
not biased in any way shape or form sc it is helpful when finding that yeah met plenty of 
like you not alone jw so first of all the overriding thing for me the simplest thing for me 
in all this is i think about choice and i think the most interesting thing has been has been 
impact that has happened globally when societies especially governments have actually given choice to their people so posttiananmen square 
and what happened then and it put the fear of god into the chinese government much of their response 
around a couple of things it was around nationalism and also around wealth creation and one of the things 
did they just made it easy for people to move and deng efforts to be able to free up 
control they had about that and what did people do they did what people do everywhere in the world 
that people sc moved to the city jw and they moved to the cities and then they moved to 
coastal cities predominantly but elsewhere in african governments when and elsewhere when they had forcibly moved people to borders 
of course people often do that to protect and fearful all across the world not just in africa and 
put people in godawful conditions and are displaced for that and kept there for generations and yet when people 
those moves what do people do they move and the greatest indication of what is i think probably what 
right is actually just looking across what happens when people a have the choice and b most importantly or 
importantly have the ability to take advantage of that choice all very well to have a choice but if 
afford to move or if there are other things keeping you there then worthless and so really happened in 
of the world jw and that part of the message and not saying this disparagingly at all this is 
proliberty procapitalism kind of thing that letting people be the individual makers of their own choices can make things 
for everyone sc oh absolutely yes the amount the nature and the direction of criticism sometimes to some of 
arguments has been interesting and sometimes very hard to get back to the facts and the issues at hand 
again people see their own politics through some of these facts but right a lot of our work is 
on demographers and professionals in this very i think fascinating realm and people like brian at the university of 
people like branko milanović who have done a lot of work understanding about the economics of and the demographics 
this and and this for me was a great eyeopener the main author of the paper that we did 
sanderson is actually an urban conservationist and he wrote a fascinating book on mannahatta what manhattan was like before 
became manhattan sc not done becoming manhattan still changing really rapidly right jw well exactly and actually the overall 
of his work and actually to continue to conceive of what it could be like and what we could 
but i had no experience of cities lived my life in cambodia and gabon and vietnam and zambia and 
like that and so come at it from looking at the countries about going through their transition and watching 
looking at societies through that the coupling with people like eric is have to think about cities and what 
within cities really has been the real change and i think what the demographers have really done have come 
with these shared socioeconomic pathways ie what the world probably could look like and this is so important to 
of our work very very few industries maybe your own where this where this actually an important feature to 
sc well yeah great so that brings us exactly back to where i wanted to pick up i asked 
are the most important causal factors helping lower the population growth rate and one might have guessed if you 
a poll on the street people would have said things like healthcare education just overall economic wealth but your 
word is jw yeah the first and it really is cities not because it is the only thing out 
but the thing that both are almost a ubiquitous feature of all these trends that are going on around 
world at the moment because also they have a number of features that we tend to see as a 
rather than as a cause sc exactly right so all these things i just mentioned maybe going say come 
more naturally or at least more readily when in this urban environment jw yeah take an issue of female 
is a crucial one the population is going to be influenced by a billion people according to whether or 
we educate subsaharan african girls over the next thirty years and that to me is an astounding fact sc 
africa being the area of the world where the population is still going like gangbusters really jw about to 
its second phase in demographic transition where just about to get sc gonna stop dying as quickly but not 
stop having kids right away jw right they are already for a bunch of reasons have for external and 
reasons have been delayed in hitting the demographic transition gonna be going through it the population rate is still 
up not just the absolute population cities have historically not been great urban creators of jobs and these and 
and all these features and yet they are starting to now gonna be a huge increase gonna be a 
reduction in poverty as well going on already sorry i should have said the poverty levels in subsaharan africa 
many awareness are actually going down quite considerably and fantastically and gonna continue to go down even though the 
is going to go up most of prediction sc is subsaharan africa urbanizing rapidly sc not as rapidly as 
other areas and their transition might be slower and have a there might be a different cadence to their 
but essentially the same transition one of the things that will come out at the very end of this 
be that what the world really needs to do is help african cities function sc right jw my goodness 
you could make african cities work and function in the way that my adopted city new york or shanghai 
many of the other cities or some positive african city examples already can do in places like kigali or 
of those areas that will have an enormous impact on a whole range of factors sc and is this 
political governmental challenge jw it is everything from just a just getting it is a governmental infrastructure this goes 
the way from very very basic things like transport i say simple of course not highly complicated jw but 
concept at least is very simple water or sanitation sc right jw and transport housing all those things all 
way up to having a civil society that is both demanding and voting and advocating for these things sc 
okay but do you so you think it is happening but that an interesting as a scientist fascinating right 
get to see the thing that we went through a couple of hundred years ago and going through subsaharan 
now jw yes and not as if devoid of examples rwanda really is a fantastic example of a country 
has faced monumental challenges and setbacks and yet with a highly dense human population it has managed to restructure 
work itself through this transition at the moment more ahead of the curve than many subsaharan african countries even 
it quite have the necessarily the natural resources of a botswana or a south africa or many of these 
countries and so there is again this other argument which i reject which is that somehow there are circumstances 
makes africa any different sc right okay that was very interesting and also so i just wanna go back 
this my mind is not letting go of this issue of the causal factors they are all back and 
right presumably urbanization depends on wealth and education and things like that what makes people decide to go to 
cities jw so again i think many of the reasons people go to the first of all predominantly talking 
youth here is that you look i was up in the borders the china russia border where we for 
years have been trying to work on wild tigers in those areas and on the russia side got tigers 
in china really they have had this population which has always and understandably consumed a lot of the prey 
of tigers and lived up in the border area been this and now no longer a lot of those 
are being naturally depopulated sc of people jw of people because the youth are moving away and got these 
and frankly rather sad populations up here of just people who just going to age out of the population 
youth move for obviously access to jobs the ability for social mobility for a whole range of opportunities that 
presented in the cities now we might still think they are terrible abusive places for those areas but this 
the economies come from these areas they generate the middle classes the urban middle classes are almost invariably across 
world the single greatest drivers for good for social change in countries whether they be in totalitarian countries whether 
be in all others and so yes there are negative aspects we should not ignore that there are social 
aspects there are a whole bunch of other issues in there but what we are seeing across the world 
that this process of people choosing to move creating wealth moving through society having greater traction and influence over 
governments and ultimately where the environmental movement comes from we should always never forget not rural movements sc no 
noticed that that was hilarious that basically all these great conservationist movements come out of big cities jw yeah 
and new york and then the roosevelts and the rest of them they were wealthy influential urbanites who and 
just ignore the elites the middle classes around the world when i first i wanna say just this one 
when i first as a basically a kid i went to southwest india as my first real exploration into 
and i almost quit there and then i almost went back because what i saw in india just outside 
in karnataka was these tiny almost remnant pockets of nature stuffed with small numbers of tigers and elephants in 
surrounded by this sea of poverty it really was shocking for me sc it was depressing yeah jw it 
not only was it depressing and as a privileged guy from england to be able to see it it 
shocking but the real depressing thing was that i saw no future i see how it was going to 
sc it was just gonna get jw and what hope for these tiny islands even if i have any 
of moral quandaries about what was happening with the human population just on a biological one what was the 
with just these last remnants and then i would also read things like the people who established yellowstone national 
in the states and people like that they were equally dumbfounded they thought when they established yellowstone this was 
to be the last remnants of the west they were down to the last few hundred bison the whole 
was just open was environmental carnage and their language was very desperate and what it meant to be able 
save one of these places and they have a future either they did it without any sense of what 
be now i went back twentyfive years later i went back twenty years ago twenty years later and it 
the most encouraging and astounding thing ever seen because not only where seeing bangalore sure it was harder for 
to get around bangalore but face it a reasonable sacrifice to what i was seeing sc exactly okay jw 
is an immense accumulation of people into the city into urban bangalore i saw poverty rates disappearing down through 
floor of course still bad and they need to get better but compared to where they were they have 
down you got sc okay to say both of those things i know poverty is very bad we like 
we should keep fighting against it but actually getting better jw it is a real challenge you often say 
very positive and people infer that you have said something sc quite yeah right jw negates the all the 
and so a little boring a little repetitious sc but poverty bad we would like to be better jw 
what i saw though and was encouraging is nikon one of the largest markets for nikon zoom lenses had 
bangalore why because these wealthy middle class the middle class of bangalore were now taking these cameras and going 
out to these places where i had been twentyfive years ago and now they were the ones that are 
for advocating for voting for nature and whilst for many years it was dependent on organizations like myself to 
able to prop up the last places where their societies could not afford or were not interested in being 
to conserve these areas luckily not fully the case in india always had this connection to nature but now 
was it had been taken over by the middle classes and of course what we want we want these 
and they were connecting up nature and we for us we had an ambition of i think four hundred 
in this large connected landscape jw now having to double that estimation of what we should have in those 
and having to readjust our ambitions for nature in the face of what was almost an impenetrable gloom because 
these reversals are happening not just because of freeing up of space and too many people obsess about the 
of freeing up space this idea of people moving off the land therefore nature can thrive an element of 
got to be very cautious because of course consumption increases we could push off our consumption and agricultural pressure 
somewhere else but the most important thing is that it produces the same environmentalists that came out of london 
hundred years ago or new york city one hundred fifty years ago are exactly the same people creating in 
in nairobi in these areas and again it points to the similarity issues sc and this is the punchy 
i think this is the sort of the deep paradoxical thing that comes through from your work basically saying 
cities are really good for nature and people wanna hear that or maybe just because they thought about it 
carefully but there are the people going away we want the people to go away but if we put 
in concentrated urban environments then that can help nature not only be sustained but recover a race there are 
that is also bad extinction also bad but maybe what seeing is a phase transition from the transition where 
that many i mean people were basically another animal species that build houses and so forth and then there 
this technological revolution the human population grew enormously but rather than just growing exponentially and having more human biomass 
the mass of the earth in a few hundred years a new equilibrium that we can reach with way 
people but still a whole bunch of nature more or less thriving jw absolutely i think a few things 
unpack there the first one about people need to be really aware that cities are the greatest drivers of 
about a stabilization of the population and really got to come to terms with that because often people see 
cities as the exemplar of an uncontrolled human population and actually the reverse and really one thing we got 
get across now of sc i mean you mentioned i think in the paper victor hugo and charles dickens 
these novels about the terrible conditions in cities in that transitional age but it gets better jw but it 
get better and if it get better people choose to move there and consistent across areas now of course 
are worse cities and there are poorly functioning cities and there are fantastic cities but essentially even the poor 
are still magnets and where people have choices people stay and even when people have levels of wealth they 
leave they move in the city and they of course but they also advocate for better cities and a 
that really is very influential that transition from having no traction and no influence to more and how one 
that to improve the quality all the environmental movements came actually from the what we call a brown environment 
is pollution so essentially people moved to cities massive wealth creation but with that was a lot of pollution 
it made these conditions miserable and then those same people that benefited are now suffering from that started advocating 
better environmental conditions and as that grew out so it spread up into the green and demanding nature and 
again so there is this necessary transition of course if we can find ways of skipping that or hastening 
transition great sc yeah and maybe we can maybe there are some policies that can make it happen faster 
jw there absolutely are ways we have to return the mistakes but essentially we and this gets back also 
the poverty issue which is cities drive people out of poverty these be very hard to imagine china which 
been the sole responsibility for the greatest number of people moving out of poverty in the history of mankind 
the last thirty years it is very hard to imagine how that could have possibly been done in an 
society sc well in fact the previous thirty years were not kind to china and some of that was 
agrarianism jw oh absolutely and even in our so in many ways their policies actually set they know how 
was exactly going to happen but they did know that they needed to to allow people to have greater 
and that was a very smart decision and everyone panicked about the onechild policy and the revocation of that 
china been utterly overwhelmed maybe sc insignificant compared jw but yes absolutely by the process of urbanization and wealth 
but so people fixate too much about the wealth creation which is a bit very significant but i do 
move if okay on to the impacts of that sc not yet i have a point to make which 
think like i actually have a couple points one is i had geoffrey west on the podcast he was 
early guest and he loves making this point about how ideas and patents and insights grow super linearly with 
density and let ourselves be a little bit romantic not about the countryside but about intellectual life and one 
the wonderful things about cities is by bringing different people into close contact with each other physically as well 
socially and so forth new ideas are struck right and such a pleasant happy story in my mind that 
just wanna keep saying it over over again if going to agree jw i agree more very hard to 
with geoffrey west on a lot of stuff his work is fantastic and scale especially and other but yeah 
call it ideation the ability to share it is a fundamental feature of humans the reason why we have 
made so much progress or in some eyes so much destruction is because we learnt how both to store 
and to be able to share information and whether one talks about language or whether one talks about other 
that really is so central to the pace of human development and cities are extraordinary to be able to 
that every country lived in and lived in very very different countries for most of my life the trends 
the same country people are a bit slow and a bit dumb sc physically slow they and one of 
the jokes one of my interests is always listening to getting the jokes of any country i live in 
what they make fun of and who they make fun of and how they do and of course most 
it is unrepeatable but there are certain commonalities and of course not because any actual difference between these people 
same people jw but because people underestimate how much access they have to how much information and how smart 
are at being able to filter and take information for their own interests even when they realize it and 
course cities are just the great drivers of ideation and the increase in populations as he far more eloquently 
in his work are the great drivers of thought processes and of course are amazing at sharing and again 
the big thing historically people can hide ideas and keep it to themselves and people can still make great 
from it but it is all linked to being able to share that information and insight and a wonderful 
sc a natural question which i also asked geoffrey ask you too is there a sense in which or 
respect to which the internet and the increased connectivity between people will start playing a role more globally that 
have played traditionally in that respect jw yes i think all very much part of the same i think 
as little islands a physical issue of cities and a technical issue of internet but actually happening is blurring 
all these differences between the connections making obviously speaking at a very delicate time where the social media and 
use of news and information and is just only now exploring the dark side of it and the negative 
of this but still it is massively outweighed massively outweighed by the positives sc were poor houses in charles 
tells me jw exactly and so whilst terrible ideas can be shared more readily as well we just need 
make sure we understand that far more scary at the moment is is being able to slow down those 
ideas for the fear about the negative ideas sc does that suggest that we should be even more enthusiastic 
we are about bringing laptops and internet connectivity to subsaharan africa jw absolutely absolutely i think again i think 
should be providing any sort of options that they choose to be able to do again for me about 
it is not telling anyone what they should or should not do certainly not subsaharan africa not been a 
history of that in the past sc by all means let them make some choices for themselves jw absolutely 
my confidence is that going to choose very similar mechanisms but also they have the chance many ways to 
whole generations of things that are no longer useful when i was living in africa cellphones came and completely 
fixed line systems in many parts not all but many parts sc it was wonderful jw and what an 
thing to do and actually they were at the forefront and africa still is very much at the forefront 
using technologies in social ways and us learning from that i think going to increase dramatically i think the 
is gonna come way in two ways now but our only thing is we should continue the communication keep 
lines open and of course this still gets eventually back to the immigration question sc sure yes do you 
to tell about the immigration question where do you wanna go i wanted to ask you about inequality but 
that was part of where you wanted to go anyway jw no we any way you want is fine 
been agreeing with you too much here just imagine what the disagreement would be wealth creation happens in cities 
but one make the argument not sure if i believe it but one make the argument that stratification also 
we mentioned manhattan and i can certainly see a future where fifty years from now no middle class people 
live in manhattan becoming a playground for the wealthy is that bad jw yeah inequality is definitely an issue 
lot of debate around it and is a very valid debate and again gonna slightly make you wince a 
bit gonna say good and a bit bad because of course one can look at it in two very 
ways the level of capture of the or whatever it is over the last few years has been phenomenal 
and we can only begin to understand what the implications of that kind of capture of wealth really is 
i claim to know or sit here and espouse on that sc but maybe that is something where rather 
letting nature take its course this is an obvious place where the government could help fix things a little 
right jw it could be and this really does get outside of really and the implications of that sc 
of course jw but i would like to say that one also has got to recognize and not totally 
is that those same drivers that have caused the creation of that wealth and however been captured and we 
talk about it but anyway have fundamentally driven hundreds of millions or billions of people out of extreme poverty 
if one looks at the work of milanović and others who have looked at inequality and some of these 
impressive reports that have come out on this again they indicate two very separate things and we can debate 
separate they actually are but does one measure inequality from the absolute lowest to the absolute highest does one 
it from the top to the bottom you can measure in many different ways and sometimes it can look 
and ugly and sometimes it can look truly glorious if one looks at inequality as literally how many the 
case surely would be people getting richer and people getting poorer at the same time sc right jw that 
be the ultimate worst and not happening really not happening sc the poor are getting less poor in an 
sense jw absolutely and that is in terms of numbers of people that is much higher than the actual 
the number of people who are disproportionately profiting overlapping conversation sc and much of that is driven by africa 
asia right jw which aspect of it sorry sc the fact that poor people are coming out of poverty 
yeah yes those are the two large regions although of course within those regions asia has this great difference 
historically still wealthy countries like japan and elsewhere and some of the poorest countries in the world so much 
diverse than say subsaharan africa and of course latin america has had significant variation as well but yes the 
move out of poverty has been purely numerically has been out of china and east and southeast asia sc 
we imagine that poverty will literally end someday that we always have this inequality jw what stuns me and 
of the things i often show people is a chart of happening to poverty around the world and i 
there are two things to look at one just look how incredibly steep that dropoff is however you measure 
i have a long argument about whether fifteen dollars two dollars a day in how we measure extreme poverty 
you measure it the dropoff is extreme and how ubiquitous it is and sure it is slower in some 
sc not just that someone was clever in some country it seems to be once again a universal aspect 
this kind of process jw yeah absolutely and so encouraging to be able to see and again got to 
a massive influence on my business worrying about the future of nature and natural resources just continuously stunned at 
few people actually are aware of this understand this and are willing to debate the implications of this but 
dropoff in extreme you know when the international community came around and set called the sustainable development goals now 
looked at halving poverty and doing it they did it sc yeah jw no they did it not saying 
they overlapping conversation sc so we should had a party for that but yeah jw and now had to 
it and now doing to actually eradicate extreme poverty now when i was a kid those kind of things 
were a joke you said what do you want world peace or what do you want to eradicate they 
kind of like okay it would never happen and i think you go back to the you go back 
the and you will be hard pushed to find the most optimistic of those professionals and academics who really 
envisage what has happened over the last few decades sc okay where did i cut you off before do 
remember jw you drew me into inequality sc i drew you into inequality but there was something you wanted 
do and i interrupted you to talk i forget what it was anyway but i could just keep asking 
if okay jw sure yeah sc okay so what is the future that imagining here people are moving into 
isaac asimov in his foundation series imagined that the galaxy was ruled by trantor a whole planet with nothing 
cities on it is that your goal is that what you want laughter jw i would like to i 
a really interesting question because i think asked enough which is a of course avoid the kind of cheesy 
and man living at one with nature but actually describe physically what actually you should do and we should 
doing that more often people like ourselves should be challenged to do that more often very good about saying 
laughter jw and very good about telling people how the solution to something which of course increasingly finding is 
correct and yet very bad at describing the world we want to live in and that should be it 
i think many of us would actually come across the same foundations and i think most people understand and 
that having a stable human population really is a goal that we should be looking for sc and an 
one amazingly jw and absolutely attainable but even put aside attainable at the moment just what it looks like 
think it really matters if six billion or eight billion or even if ten billion or even if twelve 
sure they come with different challenges the overriding issue got to somehow stabilize the other one is i think 
it we should have no poverty got to get rid of this aside from the moral imperative there is 
a livability imperative is that actually the things that poverty can used to generate and cause means that never 
able to achieve many other things if it there but of course there is that overriding moral imperative that 
should have nobody continuing to live in poverty jw and then the third one and this relates both as 
cause and effect we need this connected world yes of course we hope to maintain different cultures and diversity 
us and we hope that we all just homogenize and all the same and yet the shared sense of 
this selfimprovement this drive towards really does move more smooth and quickly when people are connected and together and 
think also the one way for us truly to reach this point where making global decisions about global issues 
are in our shared interest as opposed to fragmented ones jw and i think not just a rather cheesy 
i think something moving towards especially as we start to see cities citystates reappear now they disappeared in renaissance 
reappearing now with california as a state starting to make global climate change decisions seeing new york city taking 
and disregarding really what is happening at the larger national level and seeing this in shanghai seeing this in 
parts of the world and so shifting but that connectivity those three things those three features i think were 
attainable in many eyes not long ago and i think not only are they attainable i think happening now 
is not inevitable the one thing just keep saying this we need to take concerted action to make sure 
happen and of course we can still achieve all those things and destroy nature and the other aspect of 
no reason why we stabilize the world at twelve billion people have people probably urbanized have people connected out 
extreme poverty and yet very very little of nature left sc but see we have seven and some billion 
in the world now right so twelve billion is not a crazy number the world is still mostly nature 
to city what fraction of the land surface is covered by urban environment jw oh i think about i 
likely to get up to maybe in the next few years something like that sc and imagining that not 
a stepping stone that as far as what saying is concerned that could be a new stable equilibrium jw 
absolutely it if you imagine that most of the world would be in say under of the in of 
land extraordinary of course agriculture and productivity that got to take into account and other aspects of it but 
i think the scale of these issues and numbers is something that got to get our heads around of 
we should that people again sometimes people like cities cities are improving my goodness you go and speak to 
what it was like to live where i live in new york back in the sc i live in 
angeles so yeah been a lot of improvement right jw and we fail to recognize it and not just 
necessarily our income levels and our areas true for many now of course as soon as we stop we 
saying that people imagine that we are becoming complacent about the existing issues and not doing that however cities 
and improve one can imagine a world whereby say even of the world is covered by urban areas say 
it really matter in those areas the possibilities for not just stopping the decline in nature but then recovering 
across that or obviously agriculture and others is enormous but one cannot do that if the population continues to 
there is no tailoff in sight people are in continuing poverty remembering that this is the point i actually 
to get to which was when people start consuming when is the greatest drawdown on nature is it by 
in the middle classes moving up to the upper classes no obviously actually a movement of people out of 
sc who use nothing jw who use nothing the example i give is you give someone in poverty a 
most of that dollar if not all will go on natural resources food and understandably so and is on 
that give me a dollar now i will waste it on an apple or may save it or may 
it for other purposes and a far smaller portion of that dollar will go on natural and where really 
consumption occurs now what people will often criticize this kind of language and our work on is by saying 
people in cities they get wealthy and then they consume absolutely but that is a necessary transition for us 
get to a stage whereby you have those foundational situations that you have the urbanites you have the population 
and you have people urban now that comes at a cost there a society out there that through some 
converted natural capital to economic capital in driving their economy out of a position of poverty jw now sure 
could find ways to ameliorate that or to speed up the process or to lessen the impact but essentially 
there is a toll to be paid when china went through is still going through but really moved huge 
of people out of property there was no obvious way to do that in the speed done it without 
a toll on nature in those areas sc and maybe this is just so obvious we said it yet 
if you have two people of equal wealth one of them lives in a suburban split level and one 
them lives in an urban apartment the one in the city is gonna use a lot less electricity gas 
like that easier to heat an apartment than it is a house jw absolutely so the stats i live 
new york city again and for the average new yorker per capita versus the average american the new yorker 
less water consumption they use less electricity they use less municipal solid waste ie garbage per person per week 
those are extraordinary numbers and that by the way that person is not a better human being sc not 
overlapping conversation jw not a morally superior person but even as a measure for income their impact are tremendous 
yes two things and these are the two categories cities can be greener and can be green in of 
and also cities have a profound and unrecognized impact on the rest of the world sc right is there 
are we nevertheless helping herself to something we here if we have this new equilibrium where most people are 
in cities and the population is stabilized but still whether gradually or not using up some finite resources here 
earth right if nothing else precious metals we even mentioned the words climate change i think which is kind 
a big deal those are the dark clouds on the horizon how worried should we be about these things 
yeah so a lot of our been written with the tacit recognition of a couple of things the first 
is that climate change is the biggest issue facing our planet today sc pretty short term worrying right jw 
sc short term not in the sense also not a long term worry but an imminent worry jw an 
worry yeah absolutely and also that of course that we know to some extent that technology and those things 
going to improve dramatically and continue on this existing trajectory of amazing achievement and amazing new inventions and that 
often both people think is a curse but often actually it has historically been a cure to many things 
we follow particularly the worry technology will solve it there are people out there sc we have to remember 
are a conservationist by occupation not actually like just a pollyanna jw absolutely but there are people out there 
just say technology has always solved something and always solve it now just we know what it is not 
enough and not sufficient enough and so but quite convinced that in a world where people are educated urbanized 
and in that they are going to be making far better decisions and far better decisions on the consumption 
the nature of impacts of this world than we have done in the past so going to be far 
conservationists environmentalists whether they live in downtown manhattan or the top of a mountain in montana sc that makes 
to me do we have data about the attitudes toward climate change of urban people versus rural people jw 
yeah basically people in urban areas are much more likely to vote with these issues in mind they tend 
be the founders of a lot of sustainable use and a lot of the movements around the environment they 
come from urban areas so you just look at today about some of whether it would be the plastics 
which is a very novel thing coming out of protecting the oceans or on climate change and these things 
are from urbanites in these areas and you look at the number of people who now choose to have 
diets for the sake of the environment sc that is another very interesting thing sorry finish that thought jw 
tend to be urbanites sc they tend to be urbanites which i was gonna guess okay but it also 
that the overall trend is that people in urban environments eat more meat than people in rural environments jw 
but the sc is that a transitional period jw the transition so nobody eat the big consumption of meat 
at the change so that big change in meat comes when you go from very poor which of course 
you almost invariably cannot eat meat to effectively some set over the middle classes just use that as a 
term at the moment but you move out of poverty and when most people around the world choose with 
exception of big parts of india they generally choose to eat meat and where the consumption patterns change so 
of course beyond that the increase in wealth level has less and less impact on the quantity of meat 
eat sc i hope the amount of meat i eat is not proportional to my income i guess that 
be bad jw yeah and increasingly what seeing now is a tailoff actually seeing more people who are relatively 
and and obesity used to be a sign of wealth and sc thinness is more of yeah jw yeah 
now look how reversed and you see a real tailoff in people who have more options who are wealthier 
privileged making choices to consume less meat sc this is hitting home telling me that my voracious meateating is 
i grew up in a lower middleclass household and reached upper middleclass professordom and now that those social conditions 
my personal choices jw be less forgiving in that analysis i think but now that you have the privilege 
position to make the sc well maybe next i will be making the decision i think this is a 
of course but i do know that our current agricultural practices are an enormous driver of climate change right 
not sustainable very long term kind of crossing my fingers that scientists are gonna build better hamburgers in the 
in the petri dishes and so i have to give it up entirely because not quite convinced by the 
arguments but not at all convinced that not just convincing myself to not be convinced on the moral arguments 
really like eating good meat jw yeah and no question that food consumption is one of the great drivers 
the loss of nature and we should be very very clear about that but not just about purely about 
there are plenty of decisions one could make at except the extreme poor there are many many decisions that 
in societies can take that have a tremendous impact on the environment that is not just linked to increase 
wealth and actually the wealthier we become the more options we have to be able to choose to avoid 
negative impact so the biggest driver of deforestation in the amazon is not palm oil by an order of 
it is feeding the beef industry and so we often associate at the moment the us they eat a 
of meat and a lot of that comes from those areas and of course soy products which go into 
lots and feeds both the meat and and one of the challenges that individuals face with especially with these 
global issues like global climate change and others is on earth can little old me and never been a 
sc collective action problems jw collective but even personal responsibility sure we can get rid we can take minor 
but a real phenomenal opportunity if you wanna really make an impact just eat less meat and i can 
you a metric for actually how that hits water consumption which of course is a real growing issue of 
age how much acres of forest will be prevented from being cut down and you can hear all these 
about yes almonds take water and soy takes and all those others nothing comes close on order of magnitude 
hitting the beef and without even considering all the other climate change impacts of that sc right and and 
very careful not to say a saying eating less meat is very very helpful jw eating less i sc 
healthier too jw oh obvious there is a confluence of opportunity there are three reasons why people go vegetarian 
or vegan and they are ethical health and environmental now each of us has different views on the importance 
each of those three and where we sit on those and almost all of us like myself con ourselves 
convince ourselves on others but what you do have is a wonderful confluence of by taking a few common 
which actually that big one can have impacts on all three of those straight away no question sc well 
so maybe to finish up i liked it when you sketched out a vision for what the future could 
the good future that we might be heading toward and that an achievable one from as you say from 
point of view i know i grew up in the and there was a lot of doomsaying about the 
and population and so forth and it becomes more achievable now but we leave it all to the natural 
of things there can be disasters there can be getting there quicker or getting there slower so what should 
should our attention go in terms of doing things in terms of taking action both individually or collectively what 
should we be imagining supporting to get there jw so i am a little bit concerned that i may 
been guilty of being a little bit too positive and i want us to just recognize first off that 
is declining at terrifying rates at the moment sc extinctions is one simple thing jw one aspect of this 
through my work witnessed everything from the last rhino in vietnam disappearing to kind of the progenitors of domestic 
have gone extinct in the wild seeing declines left right and center still damaging nature to incredible degrees and 
is and i want to repeat this there is no inevitability about what described and so everything from policies 
immigration which was the point i we were overlapping conversation sc oh right immigration good yeah jw to the 
consumption of nature there is quite the possibility that countries like nigeria who go through its developmental bottleneck as 
describe it in the paper over the next generations and come out with no nature at the end of 
sc a race right a jw exactly sc to get to this new equilibrium before destroyed everything jw yeah 
my country england we went through a very slow actually period of development a small island and came out 
we basically destroyed it much of it which is why we love garden birds and our biggest carnivore is 
badger apart from being small we did have bears we did have wolves we did have all these things 
we did it america the us went through its own process much more quickly and we thought that was 
until we saw and but what america managed to do is get much more of its natural estate through 
bottleneck process that squeeze on nature that helped drive that massive rapid transition of urbanization and wealth creation of 
areas and it came out of the other end with large chunks of nature left into it and partly 
a big country but also the speed of that process happened and because you had people who cared enough 
go and hold on literally just with their fingernails hold on the pieces of land pieces of water and 
the progenitors of the environmental movements jw now this is happening in every single country to some degree happening 
china now people have this terrible view of china of nobody caring in china and yet i work with 
large number of passionate chinese nationals who look very very similar to me to those same people the muirs 
the others of american environmental movement and sc so a growing chinese environmental movement jw a very profound growing 
environmental movement now of course they come often from the brown the pollution at the moment the government is 
very scared and worried about the social movements being arranged around pollution one of the reasons why actually doing 
a bit and worrying about how to deal with pollution but so the inevitability argument gotta get out of 
way and so getting to your question there are clear things that we need to be able to do 
on a different scales from the global response down to the individual response the first one is not to 
in the way of happening in many ways and we can do this and this actually does get to 
immigration argument the first one is that we should recognize that we have in many ways been winning many 
these fights over the last few years and one of a lot of the demographers point to these different 
whereby that the world could just continue to go up past twelve billion and beyond and actually could also 
at maybe nine ten billion and then come down imagine a world where we actually ended up stabilizing at 
or seven billion people but all of those are subject to jw and one of them is the freedom 
people to move and immigration and i come from this from an ideological perspective and preconceived ideas about immigration 
my culture and happening to my culture i come from this purely from looking at understanding work and understanding 
if we shut up short now if we put up walls if we prevent immigration now not only has 
got many of the features that people are talking about now but essentially it will continue to drive up 
human population one of sc sorry how exactly does that work because not giving a release valve to countries 
are in poverty jw partly the reason partly the reason because basically immigration helps the equilibrium like any other 
you want people to move around and people then forms equilibrium and where demand and people can support them 
moves in and people and helps drive economies and and a positive thing all round and of course sometimes 
are fleeing because of persecution all those areas those people when people are in war or stress people have 
children why because they have less confidence that any of those children are gonna breathe why we have baby 
why war actually has very little effect in negative effect on human population because the long sc make up 
it more jw oh absolutely you make up for it more because artificially created this scare of people to 
more children and that scare go down the day that war stops and so population spikes happen after conflicts 
one of the things we should recognize is the world is having a lot less wars and going back 
the steven pinkerstyle argument a lot less conflict than there was sure too much but anyway and sc war 
bad jw war is bad jw i have to say that yes got it out there but we have 
lot less war and that is a phenomenally important aspect of all this one of the only other regions 
have increased human population increases is the middle east and so sc a lot of war jw a lot 
war and so if we can deal with immigration if we can cope with it and we can assimilate 
and it can remain a positive thing it is the most significant way to one of the most significant 
to bring about a world population stabilization and that is ideologically very challenging to many sc yes but it 
along with the overall philosophy that let people make their choices let the people make choices within countries between 
where to go where to live some people will make bad choices but that increased freedom of letting people 
their thing maybe paradoxically or maybe obviously helps the planet in some way jw yes and so i have 
very personal quandary challenge which is we work with a lot of very extremely poor people in rural areas 
parts of the developing world our tradition has always been to immediately help them with their circumstances there and 
and sometimes it can be fairly weak responses we can help them with we help with maybe with chicken 
or access to natural resource fish farming because often our work is around natural resources and sustainability of them 
longer clear the best thing to actually help people with and we have to really rethink this as a 
organization sc it might be to help them move you mean jw it might be to help people sc 
them more choices jw give more options definitely give them more options and the other one is just give 
more options and help them with the choice they want to make and just trust them that they have 
better idea of their of best for them rather again an ideological or institutional imperative and the to your 
question of what we need to be able to do actually no question that the world needs to pay 
attention and more support to subsaharan africa and just because traditional development has not necessarily worked with not necessarily 
effective it mean that we should not support and help and it just needs to be different sc and 
can see things changing as you said jw absolutely we can see things changing but unquestionably the education of 
african girls is of paramount importance and those organizations that help get access to education but also the ability 
girls and women to be able to use and convert that education it not only happens in the workplace 
careerwise but also in the home and is a radically important intervention the world needs to be able to 
a lot of these very very good local grassroots indigenous efforts across africa at the moment to be able 
do so that just needs to happen and we need to support that in any way we can and 
coming from an environmentalist as who worries about elephants and tigers the other one for us is to make 
work there are lots of cities around the world which are really not even getting close to optimal terribly 
really poorly designed the government paying half enough attention to them jw and yet we have unbelievable leadership in 
of our in us cities in european cities doing phenomenal things at the moment staggered honestly how encouraging it 
to sometimes look at copenhagen or look at even in new york or these areas and these initiatives that 
carrying on of course some of them work okay part of the experimentation and ideation and happening in these 
now with these cities which are wealthier than most nations which are certainly more influential than most nations can 
up imagine what we can do linking new york to lagos or one of these areas and literally help 
the things with transport with water with municipal supplies with waste and garbage purely to make it more livable 
the people of that country purely to help them with that that not only in and of itself is 
good thing the impacts and the influence that it has are enormous and that to me is such an 
and easy not easy but a conceptually easy thing to do sc yeah it seems like a hard thing 
be against jw yes sc this is a great message i like a little optimism sometimes plenty of things 
be not optimistic about jw absolutely and i and i personally like initiative on in the cities initiative that 
york mayor bloomberg has basically as we see a resurgence of the city state as i mentioned before which 
i think a fantastic thing i think cities are definitely the way of the future in terms of also 
rather than federal governments and he is helping this movement around these cities taking the leadership and a lot 
these roles including climate change and then we get down to conservation as well because again this is still 
the heart and the reason why this why involved in this is that during the and often protected areas 
national parks became very unfashionable they were seen as kind of a sc hippie jw westernimposed playgrounds and fortress 
in all these areas one of the weaknesses there was never again any narrative what was the payoff you 
had these islands lots of people are poor we had these islands and that was it and then the 
could visit them and photograph them and that was nice there was nothing for it but now we have 
we have the evidence that across the world if we are successful at getting these areas and species through 
bottleneck they are then not only gonna be just there in one hundred years time gonna start coming back 
gonna be the source site for a renaissance of nature and the world this is the exciting bit the 
can now start to envisage a world where a renaissance for nature actually happens where a we have more 
in texas than we do in the wild in the world jw absolutely no reason to think that in 
hundred years there might be ten times the number of tigers there are now funded for supported by advocated 
voted for by the peoples of those countries which historically have been too poor and disconnected and seen as 
a negative to be able to have those so our job now as environmentalists as conservationists is to get 
much of nature through the bottleneck as possible and that will be the defining feature the us managed to 
the bison through its own bottleneck sc just barely yes jw and now there are hundreds of thousands sc 
lions jw mountain lions are coming back sc we have here in la i know if you know like 
mountain lion that somehow got across the highway and is living in griffith park and people are very excited 
excited and terrified at the same time sc well careful but excited yeah jw but we get the passenger 
the passenger became extinct and you know what the bison now if those people who put them on the 
and sent them to new york city over one hundred years ago could see it now they would cry 
happiness at what achieved and hug us for what been able to do the people the passenger pigeon we 
it go would curse us out and so what our job is to be able to do is ensure 
tigers lions great apes these icons of nature these great whales can get through the bottleneck not because this 
the end point because this is just the beginning and so we have this terrifyingly exciting time over the 
fifty years of actually this is the defining moment for nature sc right jw this fifty years not not 
now because now india i guarantee you india is not gonna lose the tiger i guarantee that i could 
guarantee you that if i was here fifty years ago sc a very important point because saying that conserving 
or that species just a matter that fallen in love with this charismatic megafauna that a specific period in 
where doing this can really do good can have a huge impact on the future of the entire ecosystem 
the world jw absolutely and so the coming back to imagining global climate change the global climate change factor 
is if we lose the rest of the large intact forests of the world over the next fifty years 
no way gonna hit our global climate change target now forget technology and all those other ones at the 
conserving these forests are the prerequisite to all the other strategies working in these areas but if we lose 
congo basin now as about to go through its big demographic shift then that has an effect on every 
person in the world and our global ability to address climate change and then on a completely different end 
the spectrum the idea that somehow these were just western luxuries of us now has been proven demonstrably wrong 
culture after culture is starting now to value its own nature appreciate it and for the first time to 
able in many ways to be able to put their hand up and say i whether it be rwandans 
my mountain gorillas in rwanda and as a rwandan i want these great whales in my country and actually 
do something about so our job is not once that happens fantastic out of a job and great but 
job is now our job is now to in those areas get as much of nature through the bottleneck 
so this is actually the good place to end because as optimistic as the overall picture may be work 
be done clearly things that we can do that will have an impact and not always doing them we 
try a little bit harder jw absolutely sc all right joe walston thanks so much for being on the 
jw thanks very much music imho your best podcast so far second best alex rosenfeld also really liked carlo 
keep it up you are appreciated such clear exposition of such exciting new ideas listening to this should make 
feel more optimistic about our world today i will be requiring my students to listen carefully to this message 
sean i have question for joe walston i was so happy hear everything he explained and when i discussed 
ideas of urbanization and the current bottleneck in conservation to our biologist daughter ali she said that his argument 
not address the problem of genetic diversity within species ali said that even if we see a number of 
within a species survive the decline of the gene pool within that species due to loss of numbers will 
it very difficult for them to remain adaptable in the way that life demands unless every threat to plants 
animals is reduced to zero now today immediately the different species will not have enough genetic variability to adapt 
flourish within their ecosystems and will become weak and susceptible to disease and climate change and pathogens it would 
great if you could address this issue one day in your mindscape podcast message generally was one of the 
positive ones i have heard in a long time and i want to be able to send his optimistic 
to the younger people who are struggling so hard for answers right now ps your podcast is already fantastic
