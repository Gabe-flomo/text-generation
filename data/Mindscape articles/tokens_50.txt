everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today it is back to quantum mechanics 
of our favorite topics here it is going to continue to be a favorite topic this calendar year since 
course i have a book on quantum mechanics coming out september something deeply hidden quantum worlds and the emergence 
spacetime so scattering a few episodes about quantum mechanics throughout the year already had the discussion with david albert 
philosopher of physics at columbia where david talked about his objections to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics 
is my favorite way of thinking about quantum theory and today gonna give you the promany worlds point of 
but doing it in an interesting way today is a flipped podcast not a solo podcast with just me 
but also not the interviewer rob reid who is a podcaster himself is interviewing me and this is going 
be an episode of podcast after on sc so rob is an entrepreneur and an author the author of 
books including a couple of novels one of the novels is called after on and his podcast goes by 
same name now ordinarily if someone else has me on as a guest on their podcast i would not 
that as an episode of mindscape maybe sometimes i will do that but it would be very rare the 
circumstances here are that rob and i really worked to shape the course of the discussion ahead of time 
that it really would give me an opportunity to talk about the motivation and themes in my upcoming book 
deeply hidden so my pitch guided by questions as sort of someone not an expert in quantum mechanics so 
i do not get too esoteric for people to know going on so i try to give the basic 
of why you should be interested in many worlds what many worlds says etcetera just a little taste many 
things to be said but hopefully be comprehensible sc i do encourage everyone to take a listen to podcast 
on he recommended three different episodes that mindscape listeners might like to hear one is episode twentyone with mary 
jepsen who is a serial entrepreneur and is trying to revolutionize medical imaging episode six of after on is 
sam harris and sam and rob talk about his novel after on and the themes of the novel a 
silicon valley also a little bit about terrorism lone wolf terrorism which appears in the book and then episode 
of after on is with avi loeb an astronomy professor at harvard and avi is an influential astronomer but 
they talk about is his ideas about oumuamua i think pronouncing that correctly actually pretty sure not pronouncing that 
but there was this visitor from outer space that flew through the solar system from interstellar space and avi 
the possibility that it could be an alien starship that was doing the weird things that oumuamua was noticed 
do very unlikely that right and i think that avi is honest about that but it makes for a 
scientific discussion sc so we have a fascinating scientific discussion today try to make everyone a convert to my 
version of quantum mechanics or at least to convince you that quantum mechanics is something everyone should really care 
so go music rob reid so sean thanks so much for having me over to your office this is 
my very first time visiting caltech so really glad that able to meet here before we dive into the 
world of quantum mechanics i thought it might be interesting if you could give us a quick survey of 
two nodes of your professional career almost as if your career is in a state of superposition sc almost 
that yeah one thing i do the day job what pays the bills is a research theoretical physicist here 
caltech which means i sit in my office or at starbucks or wherever with pencil and paper or these 
with a ipad pro and apple pencil and scribble equations and trying to figure out the laws of physics 
speaking grandly speaking i suppose so traditionally done a lot of work in cosmology field theory gravitation so things 
what happened at the beginning of the universe the universe made of dark matter dark energy things like that 
days more in foundations of physics so foundations of quantum mechanics for one thing be talking about today but 
statistical mechanics so my research write papers put in journals have graduate students the whole bit and then when 
doing that i have an active program that is more outwardfacing so part of that is writing things like 
but part of it is writing things like trade books so books that written so far on the higgs 
the arrow of time the big picture and now quantum mechanics rr yeah so upcoming in september sc right 
called something deeply hidden the subtitle is quantum worlds and the emergence of spacetime so deeply is a quote 
einstein when he was a kid young einstein is given a compass and he holds it in his hand 
moves it around and the needle always points to the north and in his own retelling this is what 
him interested in science he said there must be something deeply hidden going on that explains this weird phenomenon 
he stuck with that attitude for his whole life that we simply in science accept results we want to 
going on and that turns out to be very relevant for our current conversation about quantum mechanics rr and 
leave out that a fellow podcaster sc also a podcaster right the mindscape podcast yeah been doing this for 
little bit less than a year now and having a great time rr and i looked online last night 
am two episodes ahead of you which means that you will pass me within the month because i only 
a couple of episodes a month and you keep up a very relentless week in week out you had 
episodes in april but i would say anybody who enjoys either of these podcasts would enjoy the other and 
do a great deal of science but you range very broadly as well you had a wine genius on 
a couple of weeks ago sc yeah part of the joy for me when i was writing my book 
big picture because of the broad scope of that book there was neuroscience and philosophy and evolutionary biology involved 
knock on doors and interview them right jack szostak a nobel prizewinning biologist i could call him up and 
can i come visit and chat for a couple of hours writing a and when the book was done 
ability went away i no longer had the license to do that but now i have a podcast and 
could do that rr yeah i have a similar background in that many years ago i wrote a book 
the rise of the internet as a commercial medium as it was happening i was writing it and that 
pure license to talk to anybody and i interviewed over probably two hundred people for that book sc wow 
and then that license vanished for decades and then i started doing the podcast and i was like wow 
get to do that again this is really really so of course today gonna be talking about quantum mechanics 
all the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics which you subscribe to and is a fascinating one in terms 
its ramifications particularly for me as a science fiction writer add and just frame things by saying my own 
with quantum mechanics began when i first entered the tech industry studied arabic and middle eastern history in college 
i have a traditional silicon valley background to say the least and i quickly discovered that essentially every tech 
in the world is enabled by quantum mechanics in that every single semiconductor starting with a very first transistor 
has been designed around extremely wellmodeled quantum behaviors and profoundly reliable quantum equations and given how ubiquitous technology is 
think fair to say that probably most of what separates life today from life in sits atop this foundation 
a partial mastery that we currently have of quantum mechanics rr and what was bizarre about that to me 
two things first of all i found the entire quantum realm to be so bizarre and essentially impossible to 
and even hard to believe in as i dove deeper and deeper into it and the other thing was 
very few if any of my colleagues in silicon valley knew any more about the stuff than i did 
you involved in designing semiconductors it really impinge on your life but given that this entire edifice trillions of 
in value basically modern society and the bigger picture tens if not hundreds of millions of lives saved or 
by products that sit on top of this anyway the contribution of quantum mechanics to modern society is impossible 
overstate but i would imagine you might argue that all that is eclipsed by the contribution it has made 
science and to our understanding of reality is that true sc i would argue that quantum mechanics is important 
right as far as we know it is the way nature works zero evidence ever done by an experimental 
to say maybe a flaw in quantum mechanics maybe we need to do rr so two peculiar things despite 
starting with the simple fact that we really know how it works sc well this is the weird thing 
this is the major motivation for writing the book really embarrassing how physicists have let quantum mechanics go without 
understood for so long the best theory we have and yet there are these questions that anyone can ask 
it that modern physicists have the ability to give a consensus answer to right a famous quote from richard 
saying think i can safely say that nobody understands quantum and embarrassing and even more embarrassing is that we 
an embarrassment rather than saying this is a tremendous issue that we should devote enormous intellectual resources we say 
important we have other things to rr equally fascinating as the fact that we really understand going on is 
complete nonchalance about that not just with the people at the local starbucks but in the theoretical physics community 
that i realize until i learned that from you and to me almost like imagine we are so good 
predicting the weather that we know it a full year in advance down to the number of drops in 
storm and we have these immaculate predictions that the entire travel industry agricultural industry wedding industry sits atop but 
if you go to a nobel prizewinning weatherman and probably have nobels for weathermen if it was this wellunderstood 
know i think it might be a thunder and another weatherman would say some people think a result of 
minds interacting with and another person would say and ask one hundred top weathermen one of these things is 
most of them would be like just really that just blows my mind sc it should this is the 
the skeleton in the closet at the heart of modern physics if all you cared about was making predictions 
the future got quantum mechanics pretty much sussed but you can easily go up to a physicist and ask 
when we do this measurement of a quantum rr thunder gods or sun spots sc just a black box 
oracle not an understanding we can get the answers out we know why rr and fascinatingly enough for not 
most of the people in normal life but for most of the people working in theoretical physics so this 
the third imponderable to me a so successful yet we know how it works b most people in the 
particularly care but c there is an outright hostility to probing that you have a few good anecdotes in 
book of people who have experienced this including yourself with some of the papers written and so forth sc 
story after story of brilliant physicists who tried very hard to understand quantum mechanics and were either ridiculed or 
out of the field a famous example where the editor of the physical review the major journal in physics 
out a memo saying allow any publications in the foundations of quantum it comes in mild and more virulent 
only felt it relatively mild literally while i began writing the book i was also in my other part 
my superposition of what i do for a living was writing a grant proposal or a group grand proposal 
at caltech to the department of energy theoretical physics and writing what i do what i was supposed to 
sc and i was told out that stuff you do on the foundations of quantum not just like under 
it but even mention it it makes you look less serious and brilliant people john bell been one of 
most influential people in the foundations of quantum mechanics was a scientist at cern who also did research in 
particle physics and tell anyone of his colleagues at cern that he worked on the foundations of quantum mechanics 
so why does that bias exists sc a really interesting historical development it goes back to the when quantum 
was coming into shape and one thousand nine hundred twentyseven there was literally a single event the fifth solvay 
which is the point at which we had quantum mechanics in its modern mature form the same quantum mechanics 
teach in textbooks today rr it really has a birthday sc it has a birthday exactly that was the 
for the famous einsteinbohr debates so albert einstein of course neils bohr the godfather of quantum mechanics they were 
of the grand old men at the conference even though they were both in their early at the time 
they debated about do we have quantum mechanics is it done yet they both believed it right and einstein 
particular gets a very bad rap as someone who was too old and set in his ways to really 
quantum mechanics or be satisfied with it he understood it better than anybody rr and his nobel for work 
he did in sc yeah he helped invent quantum mechanics rr yeah yeah sc he invented the photon he 
the fact that light is quantized kind of a big deal rr kind of a big deal sc but 
said not done yet there are puzzles here that make no and he tried over the years to sharpen 
puzzles into a true logical inconsistency and never quite succeeded at that but the other side was bohr and 
coworkers who said good enough stop talking about what really happens just use the oracle the black box and 
work with and if you think about history right okay what happened soon thereafter world war ii and in 
the invention of nuclear physics radioactivity and soon thereafter particle physics condensed matter physics superconductivity a really amazingly fruitful 
in the history of physics largely because quantum mechanics was invented if you buy a new sports car you 
spend a year looking at the engine and trying to understand it or you could take it out for 
spin right so the last ninety years of quantum mechanics have been taking it out for a spin without 
understanding the engine rr and that poor einstein debate persisted over many many years after the solvay conference sc 
did and bohr never really understood what einstein was saying but he won the pr battle bohr was an 
successful mentor he had an institute he had acolytes he was personally enormously charismatic and charming and his word 
spread and einstein was kind of a loner really like to work with people and very often when he 
collaborate with someone he would stop talking to them soon thereafter they did something that he approve of and 
his word never quite got out there in the same way and einstein right like not as if he 
some little gadfly who no one had heard of rr to set the stage talking about quantum physics just 
very very brief overview of newtonian physics to give us a point of comparison particularly the allencompassing salience of 
simple variables position and velocity sc newton invented classical mechanics as we now call it in the and it 
really pierresimon laplace circa who put his finger on this fact that if you knew the position and velocity 
everything in the universe newtonian mechanics lets you predict everything that will ever happen and retrodict everything that ever 
happen in the past the clockwork universe rr just those two variables sc exactly so you need to know 
everything is where every particle or every little bit of fluid or whatever it is and how fast moving 
is what we call the state of a physical system in newtonian mechanics the position and the velocity the 
you need to predict what will happen next rr and towards the end of the century physicists might have 
forgiven if they thought they were getting near the end zone right because of the great depth of understanding 
both particles and fields sc what newton gave us in the was a general framework he gave us a 
a way that physics could be you give me stuff and then you tell me where it is and 
fast moving and i tell you everything else and so the whole project of physics seemed to be trying 
figure out what was the stuff of which the universe was made and then you plug into the newtonian 
and everything follows from that now by the end of the it seemed that there were two kinds of 
everything is either a particle or a field made of particles the forces between the particles are mediated by 
those seemed to be a good general framework for doing physics and then it was just a matter of 
are the particles what are the fields and then yeah circa it all comes crashing down rr it all 
crashing down sc very very roughly speaking the road to quantum mechanics which was not easy it took twentyseven 
and two things happened we realized that particles had wavelike properties and fields had particlelike properties and this was 
confusing and ultimately quantum mechanics unified the two things so the thing that happened first was this idea that 
have particlelike properties okay so james clerk maxwell in the mid pointed out that electricity and magnetism were two 
of the same coin so we talk about the electromagnetic field and what we thought in the late century 
that we had finally understood light it particles it was a vibration and oscillation in the electric and magnetic 
but there were a couple of little problems with that idea still hanging around one is what was called 
body radiation take a hunk of matter it matter what made out of anything at all put in it 
an oven let it sit there for a very long time so it comes to an absolutely uniform temperature 
it out be glowing heated it up sc look at all the light that emitting gonna emit some long 
light some medium wavelength light some short wavelength light called black body radiation so as physicists you wanna say 
that form of and they did the calculations and for the long wavelength light they got it exactly right 
seemed to work for the short wavelength light their calculations were very clear everything you put in the oven 
be emitting an infinite amount of short wavelength light rr of ultraviolet sc of ultraviolet rr an infinite amount 
to the wave calculations that existed sc yeah crazy so they labeled it the ultraviolet catastrophe rr alright sc 
the problem was semisolved by max planck whose name i insist on rr germanically sc he pronounced it even 
i say einshtein so not consistent and planck said just imagine that when light is emitted by the glowing 
it comes in discrete packets of energy so if you know what the wavelength is i will tell you 
much energy there is in a single discrete packet long wavelength light has less energy per little packet short 
light has more energy and then he got beautiful agreement he predicted a new form of black body radiation 
agreed exactly with whatever had been observed rr so the distribution of light intensities at different frequencies matched perfectly 
you figured that light was traveling in packets sc planck say light comes in packets he said light is 
in packets so einstein in one thousand nine hundred five says well maybe because light can only come in 
form of these little discrete energy packets which we now call photons the particles of light so the analogy 
use is that planck was like saying i have a coffee maker that you only push the button and 
makes you one cup of coffee never makes half a cup of coffee or two cups of coffee it 
in discrete units of one cup of coffee and einstein says coffee only exists in one cupsized amount chuckle 
so a much more dramatic claim but it was consistent with everything and explained even more than what planck 
explained now no one knew how to reconcile the fact that maxwell had this really good successful theory of 
as waves and now planck and einstein are saying a particle but okay then niels bohr who says actually 
have kind of a fieldlike behavior by then rutherford and others had realized what the atom looks like so 
atom is a tiny little nucleus and electrons are orbiting and every picture you see of an atom looks 
a little solar system like planets orbiting the sun but again physicists wanna understand this so they say well 
a minute an electron orbiting that means the electron is moving in a circle or an ellipse that means 
electron is being jiggled back and forth and we know what happens when you jiggle electrons back and forth 
emit light what electrons do every photon that you see around you right now is because an electron was 
so you can calculate what should happen to the atom if the electron in its orbit emits light the 
is the electron should lose energy and spiral into the nucleus in a tiny fraction of a microsecond rr 
should lose energy because emitting light that uses its calories in a sense sc exactly right rr and it 
crash into the nucleus and atoms exist sc exactly the atoms should be completely unstable this is a completely 
unavoidable prediction of number one classical mechanics number two the idea that atoms look like little solar systems rr 
therefore had to stop being particles sc in one thousand nine hundred ten or all we know is that 
electrons and atoms behave like supposed to bohr comes with this out of blue suggestion when an electron is 
an atom only certain energies it can have and so rather than spiraling down a lowest energy orbit that 
electron can have and once it gets there it move anymore and de broglie who came along afterwards said 
explain why the electron has a lowest energy orbit because the electron is really a wave and much like 
vibrations of a violin string or a guitar string a fundamental and the first harmonic and second harmonic a 
set of wavelengths that a vibrating string can de broglie says a discrete set of energies the vibrating wave 
the electron can so planck and einstein say waves fields are kind of partically bohr and de broglie say 
like electrons are kind of wavy the and then in the they reconcile it all all quantum mechanics rr 
get to the heart of the matter the measurement problem the source of so much of this weirdness and 
about what might be going on sc to skip some very hard steps the answer is all waves okay 
very short answer really nothing partically about even electrons photons electrons quarks neutrinos not particles at all all waves 
when we look at them they look like particles and this took a long time to sink in that 
about quantum mechanics that you need to include some rules about what happens when we look at it rr 
the measurement problem simple core sc the measurement problem is just at heart stuff is described by a quantum 
but when you measure it when you look at it when you observe it not what you see you 
a particle that was never true in classical mechanics there need to be separate rules for what happened when 
look at the classical system you just see it it has a position it has a velocity you measure 
okay so there needed to be separate rules when you observe the quantum wave function here is what you 
see now number one why why do we need separate rules for a measurement number two what qualifies as 
measurement does it have to be a person doing the measurement would a camera count and then the rules 
we actually have tell us that when we observe the quantum system its wave function changes instantly dramatically and 
rr by dint of our observation sc yes this is what fits the data that our observation changes the 
state right away called collapse of the wave function so how quickly does that happen is it really instantaneous 
long list of questions about the measurement of quantum systems that the standard quantum formalism simply answer the thing 
we teach our undergraduates the thing that is enshrined in textbooks when you measure a quantum system you will 
the following thing with a certain probability they will not say what it means to measure something what happens 
it happens how it happens the measurement problem rr so if an electron is not a particle orbiting a 
of sorts what is it sc a wave function what it is rr and a cloud of probabilities how 
you describe that typically sc let me just say that the phrase wave function is the best we have 
terrible sc terrible yeah sc it is terrible for one thing ordinary waves that we know about exist in 
threedimensional space around us at every point in space a value for the electric field the magnetic field etcetera 
wave function you should think of as a sort of a machine you ask it a question is the 
example and it will say a certain probability you will find the following answers to your if all you 
about is the position of one electron then the wave function at every point in space it has a 
and that value tells you the probability of seeing the electron there so if the electron is in an 
the wave function is concentrated right there in the atom very close by to the nucleus and it fades 
zero very rapidly as you go further away rr so a probability curve of finding the electron at any 
point sc right why i sometimes call it a cloud of probability it really is this fuzzy thing now 
big caveat there if you have two electrons you have two clouds chuckle and this is very very annoying 
also the secret to quantum mechanics if you have two electrons rather than for electron a i give you 
probability of finding it anywhere and for electron b i give you the probability finding it anywhere quantum mechanics 
i need to give you the probability for both observations at the same time so for every possible set 
locations they could both have a probability rr talk about newton and the fact that position and velocity encompassed 
when it come down to an electron we talk about either of these things but sometimes in certain cases 
can pin down a position talk about how that happens and how when we pin down the position the 
is completely inaccessible to us and in fact it even exist sc right already in our discussion of quantum 
at the point where nothing i can say that someone disagree with this is how bad it is rr 
into the part of nonconsensus sc yeah exactly and not that you need to go into very advanced questions 
you have to say is well what is the wave function what does it mean is that what the 
is or is that just part of what the electron is or is it just our knowledge of what 
electron is nobody agrees on these questions now i have a point of view and from now on in 
conversation everything i say will be assuming my point of view and that point of view is that the 
function is what is real what actually exists not that there is an electron and we know where it 
all there is is the wave function the other point is more technical which is okay when we talked 
a particle in newtonian mechanics you said a position and a velocity and then when you were just talking 
the wave function of the electron you said a probability for getting any position what about the velocity sc 
it turns out that position and velocity are not independent of each other anymore so if you know for 
newtonian position you know nothing about its velocity right it could have any velocity whatsoever all you know where 
is but if i tell you the wave function for an electron for every single position the probability of 
it there you can figure out the probability of observing any velocity from the wave function given to you 
terms of position roughly speaking if the wave function is oscillating rapidly then the velocity is likely to be 
large number sc combining that philosophical point the wave function is what is real with that technical point one 
the other you end up with the uncertainty principle which is that in my language all there is is 
wave function position and velocity are not properties that electrons have they are possible things you can measure so 
can measure the position or you can measure the velocity but not measuring preexisting things getting a result with 
certain probability and the way wave functions work are if the position is very very localized near to one 
then you have no idea what gonna get for the velocity and vice versa if a very certain velocity 
the position is spread out all over the place so the uncertainty principle says there is no quantum wave 
for which both the position and the velocity give you definite answers rr so when you have an observation 
sort of put it in simplistic language by the act of observing you the electron to suddenly look like 
particle in a sense you pin it down to one location at that point sc in a sense yes 
the act of observation makes it exist somewhere for that moment that observing is that fair to say sc 
close as gonna get once observed it in one place enormously probable that gonna observe it right there again 
yeah there it is so in a sense the act of observation concentrates all the probabilities of where the 
may be to something close to one point sc right rr and instead of a cloud of possibilities we 
or something that rounds to that certainty that the electron is right here right now but by having done 
drained any ability to know anything about its velocity sc yeah exactly right rr and then the other thing 
is that it was not in any one place until your observation in some way coerced it into choosing 
location sc yeah right rr and the term usually used is the collapse of the wave function sc what 
when you observe rr so when you observe it it really collapses on whatever you observe sc if you 
velocity then it would collapse onto one velocity rr you basically take two mysterious quantities and you say gonna 
what one of them sc right rr and the part of the wave function that has collapsed momentarily and 
you not observed or had you not measured that would not have happened sc exactly right rr to give 
example of how this plays out in the laboratory well actually it played out as a thought experiment for 
but ultimately played out in the laboratory could you describe complementarity and the notorious doubleslit experiment sc the doubleslit 
was a thought experiment that was cooked up to help people realize how weird quantum mechanics seems to our 
it was only fairly recently done in the last couple of decades so the point is you have two 
in a screen and you shoot some stuff at them and then you observe what comes through the slits 
some detector on the other side first imagine good old classical pellets like a pellet gun and guess what 
you shoot them through two slits on the other side gonna observe a pattern of hits of the pellets 
look like two slits because what they pass through rr they basically represent the shape of the slit the 
has to come in on a trajectory that makes it through the slit so say paint pellets and you 
a big old canvas on the other side gonna have two rectangleish looking shapes with a little bit of 
pattern around them sc exactly right whereas if you take your two slits and put them in a tub 
water and slap one side of the water and let the waves move out in a circle from where 
the wave can pass through either one of the slits rr it breaks into two waves sc it breaks 
two waves and they will either constructively interfere so they build up even higher than any one of the 
themselves rr two peaks hit each other and become a super peak sc or they can destructively interfere so 
where one is peaking the other is troughing and they cancel out and you get nothing rr so you 
up with a semiregular pattern of high amplitude and low amplitude sc right so middle of the other side 
the slits see a big peak and then you see littler peaks fading as you go further away from 
middle rr so a very very different pattern on your canvas than you would have had with the pellet 
sc yeah right so then you try it with electrons rr you shoot the electrons one at a time 
say shoot the electrons one at a time why not the point is you do detect them one at 
time on the other side you get a little splat particlelike because when you observe electrons they look like 
right but you do this for many electrons but one at a time like you said and you observe 
pattern of splats and you might think that they look like two slits just like the classical pellets did 
they look like the wave pattern that you got when you put water through the waves rr so even 
shooting out one at a time they waves in the traditional way of thinking about it sc you think 
waves rr you think that waves firing them one at a time and over hundreds or thousands or however 
you send out they end up imitating this interference pattern of waves of water going through as opposed to 
single pellets sc every electron is interfering with itself which is something that waves do not something that particles 
rr ah sc which makes perfect sense if you think that electrons are really waves and that you made 
observation at the detector so so far fine but to drive home the weirdness you can say what if 
measure which slit the electron goes through because if i believe the electrons are waves it had to go 
both slits so now i wanna see which slit it goes through so gonna put a detector there and 
did the charge go through one slit or the rr and expecting at this point that gone through both 
wave sc except you have never observed half of an electron anywhere laughter rr right when you observe it 
force it to be in one location sc exactly the electron will go through either one slit or the 
you will never observe it going through both slits and when you look at the pattern on the screen 
the other side the interference has gone away now that measuring which slit the electron goes through it acts 
a purely particlelike way and you get the same kind of pattern on the other side that you got 
you shot a classical pellet gun through two big slits rr so again as we were saying earlier by 
you have forced it into a position and this is manifesting itself on the actual photographic paper or whatever 
on the other side detecting the pattern of the landings and when this was first discovered i suppose that 
lot of people thought does this mean something strange about consciousness and the fact that observing this is having 
clear impact on matter and it knows when looking and it knows when not and it behaves one way 
looking and it behaves another way when sc well that was certainly an implication or a possible direction you 
go down as soon as it became clear that making sense of quantum mechanics required separate rules for the 
observation or measurement without specifying what that meant the door was open for someone to say look observers are 
creatures i bet that human consciousness has some effect on the wave function of the electron that changes it 
we observe and the doubleslit experiment is just an especially vivid demonstration of that idea rr talk about spin 
in some ways a simplifying thing an electron will essentially have two spin states correct sc right rr and 
up or down by the language sc yes right rr yeah sc so you have some magnetic field and 
pass an electron through it and it will either be deflected upward or deflected downward along the access defined 
that magnetic field rr this is again a situation in which you pin the electron down and it either 
to be up or down sc right rr and the act of observation that makes it up or down 
yup exactly rr prior to that it was in superposition could you explain what superposition is both when talking 
spin and also when talking about location sc the idea of a superposition is the electron is in every 
position what it means to say the electron has a wave function this is supposed to be two synonymous 
of speaking you might say a wave function i could calculate the probability of observing the electron or i 
say electron is in a superposition of every possible rr in all of those positions at once sc right 
some of them rr than others sc that means more probability for seeing it there rr and notionally before 
measure the spin of the electron neither up nor down sc just like we expressed the wave function of 
electron as saying to every possible position we could observe a probability much simpler when we only think of 
spin because an infinite number of answers we could get to the position of the electron rr yes sc 
only two answers we can get to the question do we observe the spin to so the socalled wave 
for the spin of the electron is just a number associated with spin up and a separate number associated 
spin down rr and is it generally sc no it could be whatever we want rr before it goes 
the magnet that causes it to make a choice could you say electrons here are likely to be up 
likely to be down whereas those are likely to be down and likely to be sc yeah we can 
electrons in whatever wave functions we want so we can easily make them up down rr oh interesting so 
are some of the popular explanations of what happens when we collapse the wave function and establish that an 
is up versus down sc well first tell you some version of what we call the copenhagen interpretation this 
what became enshrined in one thousand nine hundred twentyseven and was taught to our undergraduates ever since which is 
ask that question something called observation there is something called measurement not explained in terms of other things it 
a fundamental part of quantum mechanics it is roughly compatible with what think if you have a microscope or 
particle accelerator or whatever and the wave function just is a black box that tells you the probability and 
functions collapse instantly when you make a measurement if the electron was spin up plus spin down if you 
it to be spin up the spin downness of it went away once and for all disappeared sc okay 
worlds which was invented by hugh everett who was a graduate student of princeton in the says the following 
you look at what taught by our elders are the rules of quantum mechanics there are wave functions they 
according to the schrödinger rr evolution is that the probabilities ebb and flow at different places sc right according 
a very definite equation so classical mechanics is the state of a system where its positions and velocities and 
evolve according to laws but then the rules of quantum mechanics tack on more rules when you observe it 
get certain outcomes with certain probabilities the wave function collapses everett says if i just erased all of those 
chuckle what if the rules of quantum mechanics were just there are wave functions and they obey the schrödinger 
any sensible measure a simpler theory the rules are much more compact the problem is it seem to match 
observations wave functions seem to collapse but everett says think about that spin measurement that doing the electron is 
up or spin down what forgetting is that you the experimenter live in the universe and the universe runs 
the rules of quantum mechanics so you obey the rules of quantum mechanics in particular you can evolve into 
positions just like electrons can nothing special about you made of electrons and protons and neutrons after all so 
happens to you when you measure the spin of the sc when the electron starts out in a a 
bit of both you are a little bit of both a little bit of the universe that says the 
was spin up and you saw it spin up and a little bit of the universe that says the 
was spin down and you saw it spin down the problem is not how we feel none of us 
ever felt like kind of in a superposition of having seen the electron spin up and the electron spin 
everett he said are not the combination of both the person who saw spin up and the person who 
spin down when you did that measurement the wave function of the universe went from describing one world to 
two worlds one in which the electron will spin up and you saw it spin up and the other 
which the electron will spin down and you saw it spin down both there there are now two people 
universe has split it has branched and i have answered the measurement problem a measurement a measurement is whenever 
tiny quantum system in a superposition interacts with a big macroscopic system and becomes entangled with it this situation 
an electron spin up and you saw it spin up plus electron spin down you saw it spin down 
the state of you is now entangled with the spin of the rr so if i can put this 
my own terms getting ready to measure the spin of a perfectly innocent unsuspecting electron sc no idea coming 
and the universe contains a single me and this ambiguous electron from my standpoint this electron with a mysterious 
state then i make the measurement and now there is a rob who has seen an electron spin up 
somewhere else there is a rob who saw it in the spindown state sc exactly rr i got tangled 
with that electron sc in a very literal sense you became entangled with that electron yes rr because my 
forced it in a sense to make a choice it actually make a choice still both things but now 
have to be two of me in order to contain the two observations sc right rr and had i 
made that observation that electron would still be in its ambiguous state and there would still be one of 
sc now we have a real definite physical theory so we can say do you mean by making a 
how quickly does it etcetera so we know what it means when you and the electron what about if 
video camera and the electron and the answer came along in the form of what we now called decoherence 
was pioneered by heinzdieter zeh in the so say that the electron you and what we call the environment 
everything else in the universe the electron can maintain its superposition without becoming entangled with the environment the electron 
stay in a superposition you as a big macroscopic thing will become entangled with the environment so now we 
finally answer the question when does a measurement happen a measurement happens when the quantum system becomes entangled with 
environment rr a previously unentangled quantum system sc right rr so we have an electron that is isolated enough 
the environment that it is in superposition that it is in effect both spin up and spin down and 
teamed up with an atom it is in effect in all positions at once to differing degrees based on 
how hard is it to isolate an electron to that degree impossible to isolate me getting hit by gazillions 
photons at all times are most electrons inherently disentangled and a rarity that one of them gets entangled because 
tiny and isolated sc once you have an unentangled electron if only that one electron not too hard to 
it unentangled from everything else especially if the electron is in an atom the atom is a contained system 
get entangled you need to have different parts of your wave function interact with the rest of the world 
so to a large extent things remain unentangled rr so if an electron in say a carbon atom a 
of electrons in a carbon atom one of the inner shells probably ever gonna perturb me i will be 
a disentangled state for perhaps billions of years sc right but i want to give people the impression that 
wave function branch very often rr yeah and for a lot of electrons they may stay in superposition for 
of years but boy are there are lot of electrons in the universe sc but also there are things 
nuclei giving off radioactivity how much radio activity does the typical human body give off do you have a 
rr like measuring what sc how many times per second does the radioactive decay happen in your body rr 
being made of plutonium or uranium i would assume a low number but the question asked suggests a shockingly 
number so gonna go with eight hundred times per second sc five thousand times per second rr oh wow 
was in the ball park sc yeah in the ballpark rr it was within an order of magnitude sc 
of magnitude rr but a lot per se sc a lot so the wave function of the universe branches 
two five thousand times a second just because of radioactive atoms in your body rr so that is a 
of universes sc so in the universe a lot of branches because every one of those five thousand is 
yes or no choice it did decay or it did not rr so a branch in which it decayed 
branch in which it did not rr yeah and then every human body every planet etcetera etcetera so there 
a great deal of branching that is going on sc yes right rr the core mystery that needs to 
explained is why do things act differently when being observed and why is it that macroscopic objects like us 
to exhibit these behaviors but if you get down to the electron scale they do are those the two 
that the competing explanations of which many worlds is one are those the two fundamental things that need to 
explained or are there one or two other things that a nonscientific mind can grasp sc there are a 
of things that need to be explained but you put your finger on two good ones the thing that 
attention as the measurement problem now mentioned this other problem why does the world look approximately classical why quantum 
very evident in our everyday lives to me a very good question that is underappreciated even in foundations of 
circles so let me give some of the other answers to the measurement problem and see what i mean 
there are two other very respectable popular approaches to the measurement problem one is called dynamical collapse dynamical collapse 
say the wave functions usually evolve according to the schrödinger equation but not always for every particle there is 
chance every second that whatever its wave function is doing it will spontaneously and randomly collapse so go from 
spread out in position to being highly concentrated at one location rr so once in a very long while 
will occur sc about once every three hundred million years rr for any given electron sc for any given 
rr but given the number of electrons in my body that would be happening all the time sc exactly 
three hundred million years is chosen very carefully rr is it derived mathematically or did they pick an arbitrary 
that was convenient sc no they checked the number that be ruled out rr okay got it sc if 
were once a second then individual electrons in your lab would just be collapsing all the time and you 
have noticed that a long time ago if it were much longer then even a relatively large system collapse 
the beauty of dynamical collapse theories is that in any one object like a table or you or me 
the electrons are entangled with each other such that when one of them collapses the others sort of jiggle 
with it rr and one of them collapses spontaneously therefore all the electrons in this arbitrary object the table 
also in sympathy or in domino effect they too will momentarily have a specified position sc exactly right so 
you could take a bowling ball and put it in a quantum superposition of being here and being a 
away okay two different physical locations in dynamical collapse theories if any one of the electrons in the bowling 
suddenly collapses either to here or to one meter away all of the other electrons and all the protons 
neutrons go with it so sort of imposed classical behavior on the world rr that sort of anchors large 
to behave in newtonian manner sc right rr and they picked this once every number because that conveniently anchors 
big enough for us to see but rare enough that if you decide to test it gonna have to 
in your lab for three hundred million years so good luck disproving that sc or you make a collection 
or a million atoms and you wait patiently rr what about a collection of three hundred million atoms right 
we need to keep them very very cool and isolated from the rest of the world and not becoming 
with the photons in the room or anything like that very very hard to do so what people are 
doing is getting tiny sets of something very very cool probably liquid helium or something and this process of 
electron spontaneously collapsing will gently heat up the material so it adds energy to the system and observable and 
that right now rr so somebody is trying to test this sc oh yeah absolutely right and doing a 
good job rr are there people doing it from the camp that generally believes in this and would rather 
to prove it or are they from the camp that is sick of hearing about this crap and would 
to disprove it sc sure they would like to prove it nobel prizes would be falling down on their 
rr is grw is that what the series is called sc grw ghirardi rimini and weber were three of 
people who first proposed a version of this theory but in this larger set of theories called dynamical collapse 
rr so one approach another called hidden variables sc yes and this is more venerable this is what louis 
broglie had in mind and what albert einstein had in mind and even what erwin schrödinger had in mind 
in the day they said i have light it has wavelike properties and particlelike properties let me just do 
obvious say that because there is both a particle and a wave and the theory was later discovered and 
by david bohm in the so now often called de brogliebohm theory or even just bohmian mechanics so now 
are really particles they had positions but you know what they are the probability in quantum mechanics just comes 
your ignorance you know where the electron is wave function is a whole separate thing and the electron interacts 
the wave function and the wave that it interacts is it gets funneled into where the wave function is 
so you are more likely to observe it where the wave function is big than where the way function 
small there are two elements to reality the locations of the particles and the wave function rr so in 
view of things the electron simply does not have a position in their view the electron always has a 
we just happen to know what it is sc right rr and then one of my favorite ones because 
really love picasso is qbism of course that has nothing to do with picasso sc nothing at all rr 
could you give us a quick zippy tour of what qbism says about this odd behavior sc well everett 
a wave function and it evolves smoothly according to the schrödinger so how could that possibly not be the 
answer well one thing is there could be things beside the wave function and that gets you in hidden 
theories another thing could be the wave function always evolve smoothly and that gets you dynamical collapse theories and 
third option is a wave function but not the real physical stuff of reality what the wave function is 
an especially mathematically elaborate way of characterizing our ignorance a way of being bayesian about things a probability of 
happening you have a credence for any proposition you might wanna have and the wave function is just a 
for calculating your personal credence that the electron will be seen to be spin up rather than spin down 
so does this bring consciousness into the equation because something in qbism called participatory realism which again sounds like 
form of painting chuckle sc yes rr so does human consciousness start getting integrated in qbism sc yes and 
and look i have tried very hard to understand qbism and i not sympathetic so there might be some 
flaws laughter that are preventing me from doing it what i can say is that if you ask a 
to lay out the rules of qbism unlike any of the other options that talked about the idea of 
agent who has experiences and makes observations is intrinsically part of the formalism rr so it does kinda sound 
consciousness and volition are part of it sc you have to ask what is an agent i know what 
answer to that is i have trouble understanding these right rr right right you no qbist sc not a 
but they are biting that bullet and many worlds is obviously a radical view because of all those worlds 
it implies okay rr yes sc dynamical collapse is a radical view because it makes the laws of physics 
and inextricably random hidden variables is probably the least radical rr it just says stuff we found yet sc 
the version of quantum mechanics that is closest to classical mechanics the least crazy thing crazy not in a 
sense but just in a deviation from previous ways of thinking sense qbism is the biggest crazy thing it 
we be in the job of talking about reality reality comes into existence as a result of our observations 
it preexist the job of physics is not describing reality to predict observational outcomes that is a hugely dramatic 
rr it is sc in science and what doing here and i think too big a shift unwarranted we 
perfectly realist versions of quantum mechanics that fit the data and an agent you know chuckle rr right sc 
is it that agents seem to agree on the world if it preexist then and things like that so 
difficult for me to take it seriously on the other hand they find it difficult to take many worlds 
rr right sc a symmetry there rr there is a symmetry there so if we took say a thousand 
physicists chosen entirely at random and asked them which of these theories do you adhere to how many would 
know and i care it just interest me so sc i think be the winner rr be the winner 
if you ask that question at a cosmology conference or a quantum information conference or a condensed matter conference 
get very different answers there is sympathy for many worlds among people with cosmology or quantum gravity interests in 
quantum information theory community where doing things like building quantum computers and stuff like that rr cryptography sc yeah 
stuff like that surprising sympathy for qbism and you can kind of understand that what doing measuring outcomes they 
agents getting experiences calculating probabilities for them what they do and in the philosophy of physics community dynamical collapse 
hidden variable theories are the most popular ones and you can understand that as well because perfectly wellformulated theories 
have any metaphysical conundrums chuckle associated with them rr the thing that just intuitively is most difficult to accept 
many worlds is that these vast expanses populated by perhaps octillions of conscious systems are just propagating constantly just 
i think most people who are hearing about the theory for the first time would basically leave it at 
and maybe to put it in more formalistic terms would say conservation of matter and energy this seems to 
creating an awful lot of something out of nothing or a awful lot of something out of a lone 
sc yeah and i think a perfectly valid first intuition to have but then you gotta go through the 
and if you buy into many worlds this current state of the universe you see around you is just 
branch of the wave function and that branch comes with what we call a weight the wave function says 
branch big or small is it thick or rr is it likely or unlikely is it a probability statement 
no there with a so when you have the electron in spin up plus spin down and the universe 
into a combination of both spin up and spin down basically not like taking the universe and doubling it 
taking the universe and slicing it in half and now two universes but each half the size of the 
universe every time you branch the wave function the total thickness of the wave function change rr this thickness 
is not something easily measurable i assume sc well you can prepare something like the electron wave function in 
superposition you want like we talked about right up down etcetera so you know what it is so then 
you measure it you know what the thickness is of the two branches that had been created but once 
created you measure it rr yeah and it just seems that whatever arbitrary thickness we assign to the universe 
in new day midnight it has an arbitrary thickness a state at that instant the number of times been 
since then not infinite but god a lot of times i mean if every single time radioactive decay in 
body and times a second and all these bodies and all these planets and we can only see fourteen 
light years in either direction it probably goes further than that with all of those splittings happening whatever thickness 
world had in it is such a minuscule sliver of it at some point you kinda run into paradox 
sc well maybe maybe not and the one thing that we know and this is sort of an embarrassing 
for an everettian we know whether there are an infinite or finite number of branches of the wave function 
the universe we even know that simple basic fact and to be fair in no version of quantum mechanics 
we know whether there are an infinite or a finite number of different distinguishable wave functions this is a 
question about quantum gravity and the wave function of the universe so physics we understand that we would need 
know before we said only a finite number of branches versus an infinite number of branches sc but having 
all that plenty of room for lots of branches you can ask yourself if the universe just keeps branching 
this fantastic rate will we run out of room for branches no nowhere close a really really big number 
there are an infinite number of dimensions in what we call a hilbert space the space of all possible 
functions then the question of how many branches there are in many worlds makes no sense always an infinite 
and what you should be asking instead is what is the relative fraction of worlds where the electron was 
up versus the electron has spin down rr and a quick aside the term for someone who adheres to 
school of thought do you prefer many worldser or everettian sc everettian is fine rr everettian yeah it has 
nice ring it sounds a little like the battery sc everett by the way is a fascinating guy rr 
talk about him briefly for somebody who had such a big academic idea he did not stay in academia 
long sc he even try he apply for jobs while he was still a graduate student he wrangled a 
in a sort of defense consulting firm and got his phd and left and unclear to me whether or 
that was because he was put off by the bad reception that his theory got it certainly did get 
bad reception rr it got a bad reception as he was writing his dissertation sc yes right rr this 
in the am i right sc rr okay sc his phd advisor was john wheeler who was the most 
phd advisor in the history of physics richard feynman was his student kip thorne was his student and hugh 
was his student and plenty others as well and mentor was guess who neils bohr chuckle worked together when 
was a postdoc and so forth and to the extent that physicists worship each other wheeler worshiped bohr and 
wheeler was stuck in the position where his mentor was the boss of the copenhagen interpretation his student had 
invented its primary competitor so wheeler tried really hard to pretend that these two theories were not in conflict 
each other and the problem was that was obviously false they were very much in conflict and everett understood 
perfectly you read what he wrote and perfectly clear he was a genius he knew exactly what he was 
about if he were alive today he would walk right into conversations about the foundations of quantum mechanics and 
right in and so he saw that his theory was a competitor to bohr he saw all the problems 
the copenhagen interpretation he laid them out everett left the field in one thousand nine hundred fiftyseven when he 
his phd thesis published and then as late as the late wheeler was still trying to get everett back 
academic physics rr he died young right sc he died young in his early he was a smoker and 
drinker and an eater his son mark has become a famous musician he is the band called eels rr 
right i think i knew that yeah sc and wrote a book a little bit of autobiography memoirs and 
everett explained that he was very angry with his father when he died he clearly take care of himself 
then he said then realized a lot of people die for bad reasons and my father lived the way 
wanted to and had a good time and a lot of worse ways to go than rr but that 
you still call yourselves everettians sc yeah it was clear who did the work rr how many of you 
there sc i honestly know the theory was completely ignored for a number of years after everett proposed it 
was eventually brice dewitt who was a physicist at university of texas who in the early he began to 
it the one who gave it the many worlds interpretation label but it never became very very popular and 
partly because of improvements in technology now that we have the ability to isolate individual quantum systems and ask 
they do to each other not simply measure them but manipulate them without measuring them without having them decohering 
need to understand the foundations of quantum mechanics better so in the physics community as a whole been a 
of their stance that studying the foundations of quantum mechanics is a bad idea and so all of the 
of quantum mechanics are getting more attention now than they ever did including everett rr and roughly how many 
taken seriously are there four or five rivals are there fifteen or sc i was on a panel at 
world science festival a few years ago bryan green was the moderator and there were four other people and 
was one of them and we each held up the flag for an approach to interpreting quantum mechanics rr 
each had a different interpretation sc yeah i was many worlds shelly goldstein was hidden variables david albert was 
collapse rüdiger schack was qbism rr now was that by prearrangement that was the theme of the panel sc 
and i think that fair i think that those four approaches are the most popular rr okay like to 
about the self in many worlds because one of the most intriguing things that pops out of it the 
that there are octillions of me quote unquote out there sc it is the right thing to think about 
it is where many worlds radically deviates from our previous experience with physics if you believe what everett says 
when i measure the spin of the electron there goes from being one copy of me to being two 
of me and natural to ask myself the question before i do that measurement which one will i end 
being the one who measured the spin up or the one who measured the spin down there will be 
of you except with a little footnote they be of you in exactly the same sense there are two 
of your future self but separate people and everett introduced this analogy like an amoeba rr yeah a really 
analogy sc right yeah an amoeba and it splits in two and then two amoebas and for the original 
to say one am i gonna gonna be both of them separate beings that came from the same original 
rr and they also have memories and memories of being the original amoeba and then thousands of generations of 
could all have equal claim to saying the sc what does it mean to have a relationship between you 
and you five minutes ago or five years ago in some sense you now is not the same you 
five years ago a slightly different person but in everyday life we have no trouble relating ourselves but if 
sit down and carefully ask what is that relationship between you now and you five years you might say 
you said continuity of memories continuity of some physical aspects a pattern that is maintained over time so not 
any problems with the issue of personal identity in many worlds just different than what it would be in 
single world theory rr so say that in the lab and now i have a choice to make going 
observe the spin up or spin down and know that as a direct consequence of that there are gonna 
twice as many mes already a huge number but gonna be twice as many mes going forward and say 
i do that and then the up me and the down me that is such a trivial experience and 
a trivial factor in the way the universe is gonna unfold whether that electron will spin up or spin 
it would seem logical that those two robs would go on to live almost identical lives sc yeah right 
they thought ahead of time spin is up gonna ask her to marry me and if spin is down 
go and be rr and then went ahead and did that sc right rr which brings us the app 
we split the universe right now sc we can rr split the universe and first explain what the app 
sc yeah this is some folks who actually worked for walt disney in their spare time they made a 
app which splits the wave function of the universe so as we know splitting the wave function of the 
happens all the time because of radio activity or whatever but you can do it intentionally one good way 
doing it intentionally is sending a photon into called a beam splitter a beam splitter is basically a piece 
glass which is sort of halfway mirrored rr half reflective sc yeah so a chance the photon bounces to 
left chance it just goes right on through rr since this is a quantum observation by operating the app 
about to do you cause a photon that would not otherwise have been beam split to beam split sc 
right they found online a lab that had hooked up a beam splitter to the internet and you can 
it to query you can say send a photon down and tell me whether it went right or and 
they did was write a little front end for that thing where they call it universe splitter and there 
two options there is a default which says a chance or play it but you can edit those so 
can say i have pizza for dinner or should i have chinese food for rr say snap once or 
twice snapping my fingers sc exactly rr so snap one or snap twice and so entering it now sc 
and you basically click a button and it sends a little signal to this laboratory in geneva and it 
and it says that the photon did the thing which predicts that you should now snap twice rr alright 
there you go rr so that is a high consequence quantum event sc the big macroscopic difference between the 
branches of the wave function in one of them you snapped only once and the other one you snapped 
rr do you wanna talk about the fifty number string that you put into your book sc yeah so 
make this vivid i went online and found a quantum random number generator and used it to generate a 
number it looks like i randomly typed in zeros and ones rr it sure does i can attest to 
sc i agreed with myself my past self agreed with my future self to whatever i generated in that 
number i was gonna put in the book rr and this was not a simple random number generator this 
a quantum sc quantum random number generator one confusion about many worlds is the idea that every time you 
a decision the world branches not how it works any time a quantum system in superposition becomes entangled with 
environment the universe branches this is very specifically a quantum random number generator which takes a quantum system measures 
in a basis where it was one way or the other so two to the power fifty is the 
of possible binary numbers i could have generated and if you believe many worlds that many branches of the 
function rr which is about a quadrillion sc about a quadrillion rr and so unusual about this is you 
this quantum event to have an impact on the macroscopic world all of your quadrillion compadres were committed to 
same project that means that there are literally quadrillion versions of this book in the metaverse sc yes rr 
probably unique in that unless somebody else has done the same laughter rr one of my favorite stories about 
church do you know george sc i know who he is i have met him once rr certainly one 
the most influential bioengineers in the world and when he wrote his book he basically encoded it in dna 
then amplified it to the point where there are more copies of it than any other book ever written 
the bible laughter rr but next time i see george i gotta tell him there quadrillion versions of sc 
versions are all the same rr yeah yeah his versions are all the same sc i forgot to actually 
it i thought about asking to put it on the title page where it says edition i would convert 
binary number into a decimal number and say this edition rr how did you forget to do that sc 
too late try rr no not still in copy editing sc yeah try to get that in there rr 
really really should do that sc if you believe everett once again the vast majority of the copies of 
got a pretty random looking number right mine was i think twentyfour zeros and twentysix ones or something what 
would expect right rr yeah sc and if it were all rr and one of the quadrillion got all 
sc one of them did rr and one of the quadrillion got all ones sc one of them got 
you got a very repeated pattern sc so there are certain tiny fraction of the quadrillion numbers that look 
to us created equal in some broader sense but they look weird to us rr and since every single 
of them by definition had to play out somewhere there are some arms of the sean carroll branch whose 
did diverge because they said thing is not sc right said shit i put that in the laughter rr 
sc they do the experiment again and get another number and overwhelming probability it would look normal rr well 
that the next thing you do if you get all zeros the one in quadrillion seans says better do 
sc yeah rr now got a quadrillion more done it again and one of those guys definitely got all 
again sc exactly right rr yeah sc so this is one of the true conundrums of many worlds somewhere 
the wave function of the universe someone is gonna get the wrong answer someone is going to be misled 
how the world works a tiny tiny tiny tiny fraction of people but it will happen the same exact 
would be true if our universe is infinite in space so a lot of planets with a lot of 
on them somewhere in space someone who does the quantum random number generator over and over again and get 
weird answer right so just life in a probabilistic universe rr could you talk about the russian roulette thought 
a little macabre but since nobody actually did it i think fair to talk about it sc i think 
everett believed in a version of it rr interesting sc sometimes called quantum immortality right rr which sounds better 
quantum suicide which is what often called sc one of those ideas much like qbism that i buy so 
do a bad job of giving it the sales pitch but imagine you had a machine that was sort 
like catesque where there is a quantum measurement with some probability that either nothing would happen to you or 
would instantly be killed if spin up it says lucky you got spin if spin down instantly killed rr 
die instantly you feel nothing sc and it really has to be instant rr yeah no sc just instant 
rr yeah sc if possible okay a thought experiment rr okay we saw the sopranos convinced what happened in 
last episode sc yeah me too actually if you think that your future self is the set of all 
your descendants in the wave function of all the different branches one branch in which there you are a 
descendant of you still alive spin up but there a version of you on the other branch that version 
in some sense all of your future selfs are still alive rr well in a sense yeah sc in 
sense yeah in a sense rr yeah yeah yeah rr interesting going forward from that point the survivor is 
branch so goddamn many times because of the nature of the universe still gonna be just gazillions of them 
by construction the branches where you exist are branches where alive and so and in some sense you never 
rr if you take the preposterous idea that your sudden death would have no impact on the wellbeing of 
loved ones then you might say no cost to me doing this because i could sit in that machine 
the contraption go off a hundred times so the odds of surviving on one way of looking at it 
two to the power but my conscious experience is simply gonna be one hundred misfires and then i go 
and have my normal day sc right and when tegmark discussed this his point was the one who survived 
have a good reason to believe the everett interpretation of rr right but that was the thing that i 
was clever if you did go through that experience and the gun went off one hundred times then you 
definitely be a committed many worlds person sc i think yeah that was the idea yeah rr at the 
of it imagine a couple of changes to this scenario first make it more humane and not a gun 
off a horn sounds so either the horn sounds or it sound and then could we set it up 
such a way that the odds are much more extreme we could say not one in a one in 
thousand chance that something very improbable is gonna happen to me which is gonna hit this button and hear 
horn i hit the button a quantum event so the universe cleaves into two one of the two new 
hears the horn and one of them now weird to me about that is for the one who hears 
horn there was essentially a chance that he was gonna have this exotic experience this improbable experience because the 
cleaves into two right sc no rr it it cleaves into sc it cleaves into two but that does 
imply a chance those two branches have very different thicknesses rr they have different thicknesses so tell me what 
means now sc yeah so this is a crucial point because this is the single most respectable antieverettian argument 
really i just came up with it sc you just came up with it even for positions i hold 
are some arguments for them i find more interesting than others rr this is a respectable one sc this 
the biggest problem cast it that way the biggest problem in everettian quantum mechanics is that everything happens not 
some things happen rarely and some things happen frequently every measurement outcome happened rr only two and there are 
percentage possibilities radically disproportionate sc yes right the question is in what sense is there a probability at all 
everettian quantum mechanics in copenhagen when you observe the system a probability given by the wave function squared and 
say there be any probability in everettian quantum mechanics everything happens with probability rr when i think about the 
thousand to one split we have caused something to happen in the metaverse that has taken one observer and 
it into two and the chance that either of those two observers since the total number of observers is 
heard the horn in each case is sc no just not right rr and so where this thing of 
is sc yeah so the observers are not created equal if i slice a loaf of bread into two 
i ask is the probability that a certain atom is in one part of the bread or the other 
depends on where i sliced it i say i sliced it halfway in the middle way over one edge 
two pieces of bread that mean probability rr but if both of these descendants of the observer are in 
way shape and form experience opinions what wearing atomic configuration identical to one another in what way does one 
a thousand times the weight of the other how does that manifest itself sc they see it like we 
said you see what your amplitude is you do a measurement to notice it but if you believe the 
of quantum mechanics and you knew what the wave function was before you did the measurement you can know 
that amplitude is rr yeah but sc the one that makes the universe make sense the amplitude that makes 
conservation work that makes probability work everything goes in exactly the same way rr okay fascinating sc i firmly 
it will all make sense and what saying is true on the other hand i wanna denigrate the idea 
this is weird and tough and we should struggle with it like i said the good worry to have 
good well glad i hit on the right one then now the other question that i have is a 
of the metaverse theories that are out there talk about there being some kind of higher dimensional space in 
universes exist you do not specifically when we first talked about this several weeks ago and i asked you 
the various clone universes are your answer was nowhere sc yeah rr now comparing that to the brane and 
this theory spells brane brane short for membrane the brane theory has it that our three spatial dimensional universe 
in a much higher dimensional space called the bulk which contains lots and lots and lots of these branes 
can at times even collide with each other and so there are lots of universes but they are inaccessible 
us in a dimension that we cannot travel in as remote as remote can be but there is this 
of a higher dimensional space in which they coexist you believe that sc well not that i believe that 
the many worlds is a completely separate idea rr within the many view the cloned universe is i think 
said is nowhere sc yeah right so very quickly in the brane example not that they exist in a 
higher dimensional space like a couple of extra dimensions right one way to have a cosmological multiverse but not 
only way the most popular way is just there are regions of space far away in our three dimensions 
things look very different rr really heard of the notion of inflation creating universe of de facto infinite extent 
there being many clones of me at great distances does that version also hold that there might be different 
laws applying a sc yes rr oh i realize that sc right it can it have to but it 
so the string theory landscape the cosmological multiverse the anthropic principle they all use that same basic idea and 
compared to many worlds sort of a very downtoearth way of having a multiverse regions far away where things 
different whereas many worlds says there are a very very large copies of exactly the same universe and being 
all the time in this room and they exist if anywhere in an abstract mathematical space called hilbert space 
is the set of all possible quantum states the universe could be in and it has the structure of 
vector space it has a dimensionality space around us is threedimensional table top is twodimensional etcetera in string theory 
number of dimensions of space is something like ten or rr depending on the dialect sc depending on the 
exactly hilbert space has a dimensionality it might be infinite dimensional at least the minimum possible number for the 
of hilbert space is two to the ten to the rr very large number sc a huge number which 
why no danger of running out of room rr that number is that big enough if we think of 
total number of particles in the observable universe is ten to the or something like that sc yeah plenty 
rr so it would accommodate the collapsing of any wave function we could possibly wanna sc yes rr in 
and so one way of viewing this is that each of these universes takes up residence at some coordinate 
hilbert space sc in hilbert space but hilbert space is not space just an abstract mathematical thing so when 
talk about two different branches of the wave function you say how nearby are rather perpendicular to each other 
fully isolated from one another sc even that is a little bit of exaggeration very very very isolated from 
other rr very very very not fully and even though talked the two branches into a mathematical abstraction the 
experience of a conscious system is going to be every bit as rich or poor or whatever it is 
if we did have this person who had the one in one thousand experience even though their universe is 
thin going to go on to live every bit as meaningful of a life with as much complexity etcetera 
sc yeah exactly the cool part of many worlds not an objection to it just a feature that is 
that your lifespan has been a constant story of the weight of your branch of the wave function getting 
and thinner chuckle less and less of the whole shebang is attributable to your branch of the wave function 
from your point of view it looks the same yourself getting smaller the world around you is getting smaller 
looks to you like the world is staying the same rr when you were born it was already minuscule 
to how it had been a century ago or a million years ago or whatever it is sc or 
second ago rr or even one second ago yeah now an important distinction as you had already pointed out 
making a decision is not splitting the universe it is simply this decoherence sc right rr so unless the 
you make involves a decoherence like objectively assigning it to the app in the phone sc exactly as long 
you realize the causality goes from quantum systems decohering to you then get it right you making a decision 
not cause quantum systems to decohere or anything like that rr i could see some people drawn to a 
doorslike view of the universe where every single decision i could have possibly made is manifested by some version 
me somewhere and therefore the totality of mes have lived all possible existences that the case sc well mostly 
the case so again always a quantum probability that weird things happen like you put a cup of coffee 
the table a probability in conventional quantum mechanics that the cup of coffee tunnels through the table and falls 
the floor incredibly tiny in the ordinary copenhagen way of thinking and also incredibly tiny in many worlds the 
is that nevertheless in many worlds a tiny fraction of the wave function in the universe has that happen 
rr and then that place that had the coffee tunnel through the table goes on to have gazillions of 
filled with gazillions of people who witnessed that sc yes but gazillions is nothing compared to the size of 
space but there are also gazillions of universes in which you made some really weird decision okay but you 
it and that caused the universe to branch rather an extraordinarily unlikely coincidence between various atoms in your brain 
cause various neurons to fire that cause you to make a certain decision so there are all sorts of 
possibilities that are happening out there in branches of the universe including ones in which it looks like you 
a different decision but the causality goes from the atoms in your brain to your macroscopic self not the 
way around rr so in this interpretation there can actually be many radically different lived lives for any given 
even though any one of these quantum decoherences is such a tiny and seemingly insignificant event sc but again 
should always think of all these possibilities as being as if they have real probabilities of happening in a 
old frequent disinterpretation so the unlikely ones you should really think of as unlikely even though there rr the 
thing that intrigues me about it is oftentimes when people talk about decoherence they talk in terms of spin 
splitting in two an easy thing to wrap your head around but if pinning down an location in space 
cloning the universe an infinite number of times right if the wave function puts the electron in any one 
countless positions like if a smooth gradation of positions even around an atom collapsing that wave function could create 
of universes correct sc if you can create a measurement apparatus with infinite precision rr when we do the 
when we do pin down the location of an electron in the lab how precise do we get sc 
precise laughter rr precise enough to make thousands of universes or billions of universes sc yeah i know the 
rr know that one okay yeah sc but again plenty of room there are ten to the photons in 
observable universe which is way more than there are protons or neutrons most of the particles in the universe 
either photons or neutrinos and most of those photons are just tootling along in the universe not interacting and 
so not spitting the universe but say that every single one of them is splitting the universe a million 
a second in two two to the ten to the every one millionth of a second plenty of room 
that rr in hilbert space yeah yeah sc in hilbert space not even coming close to using up all 
hilbert space even if that were as bad as it were so worry about the atoms in your body 
or you making decisions chuckle rr oh not worried about any of it no i think on a practical 
this is not something that impacts daily decisions well sean thank you so much for having me here sc 
pleasure rob it was a great conversation music i know if many worlds exist but i do know mine 
i do not agree with your thinking and i do not believe that many mini worlds if you distributing 
but i know how to deal with it i will not let the world disappear under my nose but 
you do i say sorry a former tenyearold who knows more than some people ps some people have too 
time george wing the new episode is not showing up in google podcasts yet maybe an issue switching to 
new host platform good to hear from you george happy to see that your skepticism is intact not sure 
the episode in google yet it seems to have successfully gone everywhere else ask two thoughts any feedback appreciated 
like to think about reality as many world especially when imagining or explaining quantum computing it is still possible 
wrap your head around the spin up or down universe split also when it comes to position or other 
particle properties where the possibilities can grow exponentially as rob pointed at the very end even if this scenario 
me hard time to visualize however i attribute a lower probability to the everettian interpretation being the one compared 
when i first thought about it this is not for the single collapse event but because at the the 
witnesses the collapse of multiple superpositions if you do the permutation of the possibilities of all these contemporary collapse 
in space per each instant and then reiterate per each single instant time started its flow this number will 
up infinite the same instant collapse events that make the number of branches unsustainable because you need to consider 
intertwined this and the fact that anything possible has happened and will happen are the reason for me attributing 
low probability to this interpretation waiting for the book to make me change opinion thanks for explaining so neatly 
dynamical wave function collapse so far with all the interpretations i have always struggled regarding the inception moment of 
universe the moment when the first was made it seemed like with no observer ever formed there could have 
been the first superposition collapse with the dynamical wave function collapse we just need to give the universe time 
just does make sense to me how the collapse interplays with spacetime expansion where can i find wave function 
app that is mentioned in podcast app is here ios only episodes should now appear in google podcasts i 
you and rob carefully explaining the knowavoid quantum foundations and those who can shut up and the many words 
before this i see how mw could manage to be right despite what readheard you say before it seemed 
dangerous i know unreasonable oxymoronic i knowthe penny finally dropped for me hen you explained that the abstract hilbert 
has tentotheholymoly amount of to contain all that branching i get it wonderful i look forward to reading your 
did you manage to get that version number on the cover the will indeed be appearing on the copyright 
first time commenter long time reader here thank you for all you do in explaining these difficult concepts to 
nontechnical folks you touched on other multiverse theories at the end of your podcast but i was curious as 
whether your new book will dig deeper into the notion that the quantum manyworlds and the inflationary multiverse are 
and the same several papers explicitly state it and you posted about it a while back but i heard 
mentioned in any public forums recently apart from max book correct me if wrong but from my little understanding 
story is that the inflationary multiverse really in a fundamental description instead reality is fundamentally a single finite system 
many possibilities where the cosmological horizon acts as a boundary that encodes any information that hits it however you 
effectively construct a cosmological multiverse by superimposing what different spatially separated observers see into a single geometry in similar 
to what you could do with observers outside and inside black hole horizons this is also consistent with the 
nima arkanihamed makes in his public lectures when he says that the many string theory solutions could be different 
of cutting a single finite object into observersystem splits am i getting the details right is this notion gaining 
wider acceptance among cosmologists and if not what are the major stumbling blocks it seems to tie up a 
of loose ends like the measure problem and is also intuitively appealing to a general audience since there is 
sense in which the everettian exist if one were to travel far enough in space so kind of puzzled 
discussed more especially in forums geared towards a lay audience i very much enjoyed the first half of this 
the discussion of wave collapse was very clear and was a big help in understanding the process the second 
was a journey too far talk about preposterous universes it seems far more rational to believe that consciousness shapes 
than to believe that every time someone observes a wave collapse that same someone appears in an alternant universe 
the same measurement and getting a different result where does the history of that alternate someone come from it 
seems clear that this theory is not amenable to testing and will always be reliant on a mathematical construct 
i thought it got going in the second half two things i need with mindscape speed control and convenient 
i find speed control here and rewind capacity is reduced peter the player have those features at the present 
sorry you can get them on other players even for this podcast eg on the web at player fm 
or on mobile with an app like overcast httpsovercastfm i enjoyed the beginning middle and end of this podcast 
know that qm was off limits how strange that is the business of conscious awareness constituting observation is something 
to hear more about what exactly does that mean always assumed that observation affected results by interfering with the 
but it seems that simple awareness interferes how was that determined thanks for the excellent podcast going to check 
rob too ps always thought a was at odds with qm and was glad to hear that he totally 
it peter if you view mindscape on youtube both features seem to work fine two naive questions if the 
world interpretation could be confirmed would that represent different behavior of physics forward and backward in time ie measurements 
a direction how does the speed of light fit into this are xxx versions of me branching in every 
due to splits in the other galaxies in the universe but they are identically diverging trees until the remote 
arrive or could they perhaps instantly diverge due to entanglement left over from the creation hi sean posted this 
patreon but it disappeared in moderation is this where the action is new subscriber but og listener here looking 
to being part of the mindscape conversation this is not a question as much as a long comment that 
antieverettian argument made in this episode feels kind of meaningless here is the extract from the transcript for the 
who hears the horn there was essentially a because the universe cleaves into two right sc no rr it 
cleaves into sc it cleaves into two but that does not imply a chance those two branches have very 
and then here only two and there are disproportionate percentage possibilities radically disproportionate sc yes so you are allowing 
to claim that the universe into and agreeing that only since the wave function can be written as a 
of arbitrarily many identical wave functions there is no meaningful way in which you can count wave functions so 
to say only two you could just as easily say as rob did that it into or a million 
whatever or it cleave at all because it was already cloven everywhere and all that happened is that some 
the branches were no longer indistinguishable from others the only relevance of the number is in the sense of 
number of empirically distinguishable outcomes also this particular objection to mw is just as applicable to qm itself if 
insist on calculating probability by counting the number of empirically distinguishable branches of the wave function going to have 
reconciling with experiment furthermore you are going to lose count including all the branches where the coffee cup tunnels 
the table pretty much just nonsense and not respectable at all perhaps the perspective is the best way to 
mw we can split the wave function before the experiment into the part that continues into up and the 
that continues into down post measurement there is not one observer in the whole wavefunction but one in every 
cloven part before the measurement each observer know what they will see post measurement so they are all identical 
then the measurement event occurs through which each component continues into its post measurement form via smooth and independent 
of equation nothing and nobody splits how equation accomplishes this feat without some hidden variable knowledge of the future 
of the measurement is a bit of a mystery to me admit but it clearly must i suspect it 
me too greatly since in spacetime the knowledge is there just some nonlocal beyondtheeventhorizon but notparticularlyhidden variables in the 
equation knows anyways sure this information is somewhere deeply hidden looking forward to finding out karsten ps all of 
above assumes that hilbert space is continuous and though you can measure it you count it like integers if 
turned out that actually discrete and finite then you could count it but then of course the counting would 
to coincide with the weights actually it would make the explanation simpler i think i should have said our 
above rather than beyond the event event horizon being a black hole thing only anyways with a little more 
i now have an actual question if i understand correctly in many worlds each branch of the wave function 
evolves smoothly and independently of every other branch through the measurement event following nothing more than the schrodinger equation 
is not special quantum mechanically just a particular configuration of the macroscopic wave function but then in a quantum 
measurement there are two different postmeasurement wave functions both of which would have evolved independently from identical premeasurement wave 
how can equation evolve two identical states into two different states are they the same inside the measurement event 
cone but different beyond it such that there is some information that arrives from the edge of the light 
at the moment of the measurement that causes each wave function to evolve differently if so since each wave 
is locally identical before the measurement but not globally identical does this mean that measurement intrinsically involves nonsmooth wave 
configurations does the apparent measurement event statecleaving intrinsically relate to our inability to configure the premeasurement state beyond the 
cone am i completely off track five questions sorry thank you for the wonderfully thought provoking podcast i suspect 
are thousands of listeners who like me get to relive the joy of an otherwise distantly fading physics education 
to you karsten princípios gerais da mecânica quântica sean carroll gostei muito de ler sua apresentação bastante elucidativo embora 
ficasse com algumas dúvidas mau seria se não ficasse é um tema que me fascina espero adquiri o seu 
livro deeply obrigada sean carroll perfeitamente enunciado hey sean i tried to support you by ordering your book just 
find that it be pre ordered that would be nice you know in three days i will forget that 
intended to order it and then you will have a sale less plus because all pre ordered books are 
the first week your chances to jump into one of those bestseller lists are better with preorders than without 
the way a big compliment for your podcast you have a great voice and interesting topics andreas i realise 
did not say this but i do suspect thought it is many worlds as experienced by us the phenomenon 
time in other words is entropy emergent from the vast number of wave function collapses i look forward to 
comments on this especially as it might relate to special and general relativity not sure dewitt did everett any 
by calling it the idea of a global quantum wave function which includes the observer and environment seems to 
solve the problem what advantage do we add by saying that decoherence splits the universe what have we gained 
saying that each branch as a to use word the global quantum wave function already every possible set of 
states aka universe the magnitude of the function at each state the of that branch argument against manyworld approach 
sean here is one argument against quantum manyworld theory every second the universe branches into five thousand universes as 
mentioned in the podcast and each of those five thousand universes branches into five thousand more after one more 
now consider an eighty year old person he has lived close to seconds which is billion seconds so in 
life time universe has branched times which is unfathomably and uncomprehensibly large number so close to his death he 
that many copies of him in different worlds now if you choose randomly a person existence heshe find himself 
be in the era where almost infinite copies of him exist which is close to his death so everyone 
should find himselfherself close to hisher death with almost a probability one we clearly see that is not the 
so manyworld theory can not be true looking forward for your comment on the merit of this argument thanks 
sean what confuses me is the word observation our commonplace use of the word hides the fact that in 
to observe something we must interact with it you say in the podcast that when we try to observe 
slit the electron went through the interference pattern disappears but this be easily explained by stating that the measurement 
or field disrupted the experiment you owe me bus money i walked halfway across town listening to this then 
the rest of the way across town listening to the david albert episode now noon and hot and i 
to get all the way back across town really great conversations thank you comments are closed sean carroll hosts
