any regular episodes of mindscape this week or next as we take a holiday break regular service will resume 
monday january in the meantime here is a special holiday message most likely it will be of interest to 
few people no real substantive content just me talking about the state of the podcast and some other things 
doing thanks to everyone for listening looking toward great things in support mindscape on patreon or paypal i suggest 
interview allison pregler or brad jones about so bad good movies how can a movie be so bad good 
makes a movie fall into this category how come bad comedies are so painful to sit through love the 
it hits a lot of right notes for me one especially good is the thrust to engage dissenting views 
grace and a desire to have a constructive discussion a rare skill and i would very much like to 
to be better at it peace out happy holidays i was not one of the people who complained for 
only i much prefer the varied neverknowwhat topics also i prefer the audio only format so i can listen 
i am driving i just have patience to sit and watch a video interview the other problem with video 
is that once people go video people clamor for special effects power point maps and charts etc and if 
podcast goes that direction then listening to the audio only will become impossible love the podcast and very much 
forward to your book please interview the stanford physicist leonard susskind and the polymath eric weinstein they would be 
guests also please do an episode devoted to the current state of research on disease causes and treatment happy 
audio quality has been good for these imho but i am in general not bothered by audio quality in 
so long as it is coherent low bar i guess i would suggest interviewing james wathey a neuroscientist out 
ca who has written a pretty interesting book on the neurobiological basis of religious belief would also like some 
of the free energy principle have not listened to every episode so maybe this was touched on already thank 
my three favorite podcasts were the one where you spoke solo poker player liv boeree and the movie director 
derrickson however all enjoyable thanks for all you do i think some guests like the poker player musicians scifi 
etc are a little riskier because they are different but at the same time when listeners like a guest 
expect to like where the biggest reward is imo for instance i enjoyed the jazz player much more than 
expected i have a desire to hear guests that offer alternatives to main theories within physics such as string 
that completely offthewall fringe i would love to hear a guest that knows about nuclear fusion progress the last 
heard a new magnet was developed to contain the core but like to hear a lot more detail to 
in the holes of my knowledge i would like to hear more about how science and politics come together 
on global warming i believe that global warming is occurring but that climate scientists are too alarmist about the 
which is a position scott adams has stated i would want to hear both someone who is on the 
of the climate scientists and someone who takes my side so i can really make informed determinations about my 
finally i drafthobbyist am still banned by you on twitter i have been for years i really know why 
only thing i can think is that a rights activist and you might have a wrong impression of what 
might believe because of that you claim in this podcast that you want to talk with those you disagree 
yet you block people like me who you disagree with who did absolutely nothing wrong i would appreciate you 
that wrong yours is my favorite podcast i enjoy the diversity of interviewees but if i do not feel 
i will get anythingenough from any one i listen for fifteen minutes then turn off beauty of podcasts perhaps 
to get peter atkins on i suspect that his views on the laws of nature saw the research institute 
do not have sufficient rigor he is a bit of of a curmudgeon so if not could you discuss 
views on your next me nice job sean looking forward to more adventures happy trails in i was one 
those people who wanted more physics but now i understand your philosophy and vision for this podcast and found 
of the other podcasts fascinating keep it up nonetheless still very excited for your new book on quantum mechanics 
the podcasts have on quantum mechanics heard that the multiverse that arises from quantum mechanics cosmology and string theory 
all the same multiverse like to understand how that can be maybe some guests like brian greene or max 
would be very enjoyable i could listen to sean carroll solo episodes all day so i have a question 
the next one mr carroll do you think humankind will make it whatever that means greetings from eastern europe 
the can we have sabine hossenfelder as a guest please love the podcasts including the balance of physics versus 
stuff if looking for ideas of new topics throw in my two cents green chemistry as a chemist this 
a pet thing for i feel like chemistry can be somewhat stuck in the century definitely lost ground to 
and biology imagewise but to me this seems like a very exciting and important movement to bring things forward 
warner is doing some nice things and is a good communicator as a suggestion any interesting angles on the 
clean energy revolution as a young person intending to live on earth for a few more decades this is 
pet thing for me biofuels maybe someone working at iter an impartial view of lftr energy storage systems or 
else that seems cool to you i would love to learn more about linguistics it seems dead interesting an 
would also be cool the bitcoin episode teased me a bit on that maybe even the economics of trying 
build a more sustainable society the leftfield topics like scaling laws and how cities may benefit conservation were really 
surprising ideas like that are great and finally i loved the vibe between you and janna levin a bit 
humor always brings a nice spark to the conversation so guests who you know and have a bit of 
with are a bonus hope something useful in there look forward to hearing more from you this year finally 
drafthobbyist am still banned by you on twitter i have been for years i really know why the only 
i can think is that a rights activist and you might have a wrong impression of what i might 
because of that but then i suspect your declaration of being a trump supporter would tend to confirm prior 
of really like your podcasts as for suggestions for future subjects topics recommend linguistics i come from a linguistics 
myself think that many people would find it interesting as for a person to interview suggest john mcwhorter a 
prof currently teaching at columbia u i believe read one of his books some of his material online really 
knowledgeable if you could get him for an interview be a real coup i think sean having just listened 
your i can only say please change anything i love the broad range of topics and that you always 
to sneak in a bit of physics into just about every conversation i have loved all the podcasts but 
chemistry with wynton marsalis was the standout for me my pick would be yuval noah harari particularly for his 
on ai all the best for two thousand nineteen from tasmania australia ps patreon per episode is perfect and 
ads if possible please please have a discussion with edward feser i believe he works a short distance away 
you comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts
