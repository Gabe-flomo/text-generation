transcript sean carroll interviewer hello everybody and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and i wanna 
your time with banter today because we have a very special guest very happy to have wynton marsalis join 
on the podcast if you are in any sense a jazz fan wynton marsalis is the proverbial guy who 
no introduction been acclaimed as a trumpet player of course but also as a composer a band leader and 
an educator and an ambassador for jazz music worldwide the winner of multiple grammy awards he was the first 
musician indeed the first nonclassical musician to win a pulitzer prize countless honorary degrees national awards etcetera si recorded 
huge number of albums as a leader of small ensembles big bands and in collaboration with a diverse group 
people from willie nelson to eric clapton to traditional musicians around the world also the founder and leader of 
at lincoln center which joins things like the metropolitan opera and the new york philharmonic in residence at lincoln 
not only that but he is a classical musician who both composes and plays trumpet with symphony orchestras he 
a grammy for that too so you get the point wynton marsalis is arguably the most important figure alive 
jazz today and certainly enormously influential in how we think about music he and i got to meet at 
nice event called kentpresents this is an ideas festival in connecticut sponsored by ben and donna rosen and we 
it off immediately si a very curious guy he wanted to know about physics and things like that i 
to know about jazz so we have a wideranging bouncy conversation and if you like jazz or never heard 
wynton marsalis no problem i would still recommend listening to this episode this is not one of those conversations 
we just namedrop our favorite musicians or artists from the past or from the present wynton marsalis is an 
guy he always has been been one of his trademarks all along and he gives us some of his 
not just about music but about the state of the world the state of the country the state of 
in the united states we talk about physics we talk about time and quantum mechanics this is your chance 
spend an hour with a brilliant creative person with an open fertile mind we had a great time and 
hope you will too so go music si wynton marsalis welcome to the mindscape podcast wynton marsalis alright this 
such a pleasure sean thank you si so i understand that your first paying gig was as a funk 
is that right wm right right si this is the this is the bell bottoms the big hair the 
bit wm right early early in that year we played an elementary school dance si an elementary school dance 
did you get recompense for this did you get paid wm yeah we got paid we got paid one 
dollars it was five of us so it was twenty dollars a person si and what were you playing 
we played just stuff that was on the radio at that time but we had learned maybe fifteen songs 
twenty songs or twenty songs three minutes it was a dance for three hours so after we played the 
songs we were like and everybody was like we still have two more hours to so we just played 
si play it again wm in a loop si they could still dance chuckle wm we played in a 
over and over again so we always laugh about that about that job si but there is something special 
jazz right what in your mind is what makes jazz special wm i think that the three fundamentals are 
music improvisation to some type of grid so you can improvise but you have some restraint the swing which 
improvising with other people and there are things that govern how you are will interact with each other but 
things you also choose them so if a heavy swinger you choose to be in the groove and you 
to give some points over to people if not you and then the blues which is an optimism in 
of all evidence to the contrary si aha so explain that wm like in the words of a blues 
down to the railroad put my head on the track i went down to the railroad put my head 
the track when that train came along i snatched my fool head si so something in there so the 
is about living through life not giving up wm living about an optimism not na√Øve si right right and 
say more about swing in particular had talks with musician friends not a musician myself i appreciate the music 
much but swing other genres of music that improvise the blues is a genre all by itself but swing 
something that is uniquely jazz wm right physics relational and quantifiable the reconciliation of opposites so if you look 
swing as a concept whatever it takes for you to get from the consciousness to the consciousness is swinging 
when you embrace that in such a way that in a groove and you make all the little adjustments 
are required to make to not just endure another person or to tolerate them but you embrace them then 
so when you look at it as a concept it is a six rhythm ding ding di ding ding 
two three four five six one two three four five six one two three four five six against a 
rhythm one two three four one two three four ding ding di ding ding di ding di ding di 
wm on the micro level where it shows up is if you start to play fast so if you 
ding ding di ding then you go doodledoodlediddledoodledoodlediddledoodledoodlediddle you go tackatackatackatackatacka you have to go doodledoodlediddle shuffling so a 
and a three also so instead of it being datadatadatadatada ta ta ta ta ta ta ta doodledoodlediddledoodledoodlediddledoodledoodlediddle difficult 
negotiate the feeling of though that odd and even at the same time the swing is the bass which 
the lowest pitch played in four on every beat matched with the drums this in six which the cymbal 
the highest pitch and the pitch that you can hear the most so you have all these extremes si 
like the drummer has a tough job there wm the drummer has a tough job president he can just 
to just bowl everybody over but great see a great drummer as kind they use their power very intelligently 
sparingly si and it sounds like so much music is about tension in some sense right a competition between 
you expect the sort of natural easy rhythm pattern versus a little bit of what quite belong that drives 
forward right wm right interested in how you would see that in relation to some concepts that you work 
where you have opposite things they come together and you say these two things are together i never would 
thought these things come together si yeah all over the place physics science is driven by what we understand 
try to leap into the places that we yet understand science professional scientists spend their time doing homework problems 
the college students do and so what is the way to make progress to pinpoint two things that you 
think are true but they agree with each other right and where all progress comes from so the big 
right now in physics is we have quantum mechanics and we have gravity and they play well together and 
tension right and trying to figure out is one of them better is one of them more fundamental or 
it we gotta start all over again and sort of this force of creativity a little bit right and 
jazz seems to be much about creativity wm yes about creativity at the point of impact i was also 
in your comments about time because in jazz you live in the future you progress from the future to 
past si oh okay wait a minute wm so like life in the future but going into the past 
forward into the past you move forward into the future si now gonna have to break that down for 
a little bit chuckle wm you are in the future like now the past okay so all in the 
si good wm the future in that then we passed through the present into our cognizance of that present 
is then past so jazz is a mastery of a moment of presentness so the future becomes what you 
may perhaps happen with the form at a in a given space and time and the challenge of jazz 
actually playing it is can i deal with it with all of the entropic moments of this present and 
it organization and and give it organization and logic and form with a group of other people who have 
idea what gonna play until they play it si well i wanted to ask you about this so the 
improvising and the group just do the individual first i think probably easier to wrap our brains around right 
you go into an improvisation to a solo with a plan or is it literally right there what feeling 
i never do that every person is different i like to be present so i have a plan my 
plan is to take thematic material and develop it in some type of interesting way to me si and 
that the chords or the melody wm the chords are the playing field like a football field you know 
it is si yeah the arena wm the arena so you know in a football field the sidelines the 
progress at a certain way and some alterations but they are the harmonies and laid out in time so 
you look at a clock using those twelve numbers and you know where you are when you look at 
hands you know how a harmonic form is you know where you are by the progression of harmonies and 
also si where you have to get back to wm you know when you get back to the top 
the top may be different but the harmony the harmony is basically the same but because chords have different 
notes and also a way to substitute chords kinda like the directions to your home you give me fifty 
of directions then incorporate different streets and the general direction will be all the different ways you can express 
equation with different numbers wm playing on that playing field so now we know that then we have to 
in time and the concept of time in jazz is probably the most kinda physicsrelated because not in time 
two three time in what we call and not being on time being in time and that time is 
a wave everybody is tugging and pulling at it si right yeah when you mentioned how important it is 
physics exactly right like so much of physics is about waves and the resonance the beating together and the 
when going in different directions right wm what more interested in does the degree of interference determine something about 
wave or does a wave just continue the way it is si yeah it can be either way right 
i think that physicists love to start with the simplest thing first right so the simplest thing is yeah 
if you have two different waves and coming into the same place they do their own individual thing and 
they keep going and at that moment they might interfere or constructively interfere which is a sort of contradiction 
terms what it means they add up together right si so we teach our students that first and then 
next thing we teach is what if these waves are talking to each other what if they interact with 
and these days we think our best theories of the world are quantum field theories where the world is 
collection of fields pervading all of space and what we think of as particles are vibrations in these fields 
if you make a new particle in fact the analogy i use is if playing a piano and another 
in the room the other piano starts humming a little bit how you create new particles in particle physics 
kind of sympathetic vibration si exactly that right wm exactly what jazz is like a lot of times you 
anticipate what somebody is gonna play or you could feel him a certain way and sometimes they do the 
and okay too yeah like super conversation si no wrong notes right wm yeah there are actually no wrong 
there are only awkward moments and nonresolutions and lack of confidence you have to hear your way out of 
kinda given a conversation somebody si oh yeah awkward moments wm dealing with a awkward yeah but fascinating when 
get a lot of people improvising who really can play how they all hear and interpret the moments the 
moments of crisis always a crisis every moment is a crisis and when the band stops a break and 
you play then really a crisis for you because you have to maintain a momentum and the si lean 
everybody else wm no gone then they come back in so i think really about mastery of time and 
mastery of time is an individual thing on one level but in the jazz sense and in the swing 
mastery of the fluctuations of time with other people si right yeah and where swing comes wm what swing 
si just pushing up and against the obvious regular beat right wm right you have the obvious regular beat 
a constant that you all know but the swing is all of you interpretation of that constant and how 
can negotiate that constant and make it feel good si and sometimes these solos can get pretty long you 
go on for a long time how much of it is conscious would you say could you even remember 
solo that you played wm no you remember but conscious like when you speak is conscious like you using 
when you would talk when you lectured the other day but you knew what you were talking about si 
knew the general outline i was gonna say but i had a plan going in and wm well the 
gives us a plan so when i said have a the form gives you some type of plan and 
i tend to take things from the musicians playing with like when they play stuff i play things and 
think that in my solos i try to really think about construction si okay what do you mean by 
wm i mean how am i gonna get from this point by turning phrases around or how am i 
to make a cohesive and coherent statement si telling a story wm how am i gonna tell that si 
middle and end wm so that you can follow it right and how can i get all these little 
and interesting things and change the emotions of different moments and add things si and it is usually in 
group context right and as impressed and overwhelmed as i am with a master improviser even more impressed that 
can do it together and how much of it i see on the bandstand people looking at each other 
the players how much wm a lot si is it planned out is it really just you sense it 
no so much communication and what i love the most about playing is playing with other people so much 
like shifting beats or getting ready to end your solo is that really the chord you wanna play where 
oh okay are you gonna play rifted so much of it like so innocent very intense like an intense 
and mind game with other people and all benevolent none of it because the swing is a reference and 
makes if you wanna swing it makes you have a constant that you all agree on kind of what 
constitution is supposed to be you have to agree on something something has to have meaning in order for 
to have a meaningful dialogue and there has to be some arbiter something that we both will be okay 
otherwise just noise right wm not sell this to our kids si right laughter wm yeah si yeah yeah 
and jazz you mentioned in for the podcast listeners out there we just got finished with some remarks that 
made here on stage and you also mentioned the americaness of it right wm yeah si wm yes si 
for better or for worse mostly for better but jazz is part of america and america is part of 
wm well i think for worse but worse is a part of better you like what you were saying 
you gave us the examples of entropy one is nothing then some things then not gonna have one of 
one thing si right if everything is too simple nothing interesting has happened wm right and the famous shakespeare 
be or not to be yes gonna be one of those or maybe all the kinda greatest artists have 
kind of dichotomous unity they understand why a shakespearean villain is so great he understands something noble in this 
a humanity in the villain and that kind of simplistic way of looking at the world does not work 
for democracy and jazz it came from the most maligned group people that have been slaves but they play 
when they were in slavery they played jazz when they became free and freedom is something that has not 
guaranteed to people in the world throughout time si no wm if you go throughout time most groups of 
have been dominated or they have been beaten to be subjugated to the will of a person or a 
of people not something only about the united states of america most of the greatest heroes that we celebrate 
military heroes that defeated people and engaged in absolute murder concubinage and slavery si why they like to talk 
it wm right why they were conquering people america is the hope that we have to change and hard 
and challenging and we at this moment appear to not be up to that challenge but when we actually 
what the going on in the world and that democracy and even the thought that there is equality is 
something guaranteed your side is not guaranteed to win si no wm a lot of power and by that 
mean in the fear of another nation i mean the fear of an ideology which says hell with these 
is what has dominated the world most of the time and has even been dominant in our leadership if 
its people si but a democracy is a place where you can lose an election and give up power 
right you cling to it wm supposed to si supposed to yes wm yeah also supposed to agree on 
set of principles si would you say that jazz is in some sense a democratic form of music compared 
others wm absolutely no question about it in every way i could take you down the constitution and the 
of powers all of the things that are the foundation of what we do the ability to amend the 
and the constitution being a very simple framed document shorter than every other state constitution and the repetitiveness of 
constitution from the federal government to the state government to the local government but when you have an agreement 
the humanity of other people then you subvert the constitution si yeah and in some sense this is what 
democracy is all about i had a podcast about liberal democracy the idea you have to agree with your 
citizens about values necessarily you can disagree about fundamental things but there has to be something shared right there 
to be something shared that you agree with and you base everything on that and a bunch of players 
there improvising together have to be the same way wm and many times not what is happening with our 
many times is one person will solo all night five people will solo forever mine which was on the 
that allowed other people were playing all with them in it the strongest on the bandstand dominating the bass 
the amp up to then very difficult to play the music and then another thing that happens after that 
slavery and the slavery becomes system has too much freedom in it let me figure out how to repeat 
over and over again so that we do away with some of this and the direction we will go 
if we listen if we check out the way systems are slowly beginning to dominate everything and our systems 
thinkers are very powerful and we realize that when you play a system a very intelligently designed system out 
the furthest extreme of its efficiency many of these systems include people there has to be something else si 
the machine wm just the machine we need you then after we need you we want to see you 
and so saying you can think of jazz as a little bit of a protest against this tendency when 
its best even in jazz right wm a lot of yeah si in any form of art you can 
denigrate into wm right si where a great man with an ego wm yeah a lot of it though 
lot of the tenets and the best of it the recorded history of it and jazz is also not 
machine not we are against the machine we are against the abuse of tools and we are for the 
principles of our way of government and our music has a history that demonstrates that duke orchestra demonstrated that 
orchestra demonstrated that dave ensemble john coltrane art blakey the jazz messengers we have people after si charles mingus 
charles mingus and they were also able to express that and did express it so not something speculating on 
yeah yeah yeah jazz has an interesting position in history in the united states and right now not a 
of radio stations out there that play primarily jazz been as influential as anybody in not just keeping jazz 
but keeping it vibrant and making sure that people are educated about it how important is that to you 
very important for us to be educated about our country stopped civics we have to understand that for democracy 
work we have to be rabid about education rabid not about propaganda because not a kind of left right 
i laugh at all of that because for me like subterfuge like you and your friend start a fight 
a store and another one of your friends is going for the cash register now all you gotta do 
get a black and a white friend call each other a name looking at it wm all fake people 
making money and exploiting one of the biggest problems we have and it happens in jazz is the greatest 
have to sacrifice for lesser players like the great art blakey allowed me to learn on his bandstand i 
anything to him he had to be willing to sacrifice for me to learn when you get the most 
class waging war on the uneducated class you have a hard time not gonna get the same thing that 
get with the ku klux klan or somebody shouting and calling people names gonna get contracts you get the 
loan scandal you can get all the things that you see that our systems they play out on people 
assess their position their position in space si were i probably know the answer to this but how much 
this was in your brain when you were twelve years old and first learning to play the trumpet wm 
lot of it i know it was about playing the trumpet but my mom and my dad were very 
my a jazz musician si just so everyone knows from new orleans wm from new orleans si so a 
orleans guy wm and my mother was very conscious about reading and staying on top of stuff being engaged 
father was very conscious so i would always just be around listening to all of them talk and i 
of course what i understand now but i knew that you needed to know about the country you needed 
follow things you needed to and that was in a time of consciousness i was a kid through the 
people were conscious si yeah it was something that was talked about right wm the pop music was conscious 
if it was just stevie music marvin music going on for just the average kinda citizen out here that 
an artist father or mother they were still engaged in making things better and being a part of a 
thing we lost that momentum of course over time because difficult to maintain that level of engagement with each 
without being predatory we celebrate predators si well natural to devolve into conflict we try to talk to each 
and try to disagree again this is something that i hope the podcast helps to spread the idea we 
disagree still be friends go out for the beer afterward or whatever but it becomes harder and harder especially 
a very shouty age that we live in wm a shouty ideological age that is not respectful of any 
chuckle si also true that is right wm there has to be some fact that we agree on in 
okay a fact just start with that and why i try to explain things in a human context the 
i knew whether i argued with them or not when we talk to each other talking about human things 
my philosophy about this style of music it was momma is or son told me the other or you 
that i i i had dyslexia and i was always ashamed you know what i mean human si absolutely 
you try to be a communicator of science even though science is based on facts and you should all 
then if you really want to get things across you have to be likable you have to relate it 
interests right people care about what matters for their lives not surprising at all wm but what wonderful at 
i first talked to you very approachable i started asking you about entanglement and will the universe just continue 
expand and you started giving me very concrete kind of breakdowns of what something was in a way that 
could understand it and friendly si i think it matters honestly to give credit where credit is due my 
gets a lot of credit for this laughter si a scientist by training a writer by training so helped 
in the communication skills so you went from this kid in a household where all these ideas were talked 
in a very musical household obviously playing all sorts of things now the director of jazz at lincoln center 
a responsibility right how do you think of that role a musician you play the trumpet a composer but 
also an ambassador right wm yeah honored to be in that role i love people i like to talk 
the music and to be a part of lives and to recognize other people jazz at lincoln center our 
tenets so what we do we entertain educating we advocate for jazz through performance through education and through advocacy 
try to bring people together around the music we have a very simple kind of downhome type of welcome 
we have no generation si oh is that true okay i was gonna ask about that yeah wm no 
this is what we stress no generation gap no segregation and all of our music is modern not separated 
the kind of time periods we believe the music does have fundamentals we believe everything this horn is jazz 
not against things that are not jazz we just are in favor of jazz and been blessed to work 
with so many musicians of different cultures and played si tell me some of your favorites wm man i 
just tell you a couple of stories one is a great master drummer from ghana yacub addy he passed 
i did a piece called congo square with him it took me ten years to write this piece i 
rhythms i figure out because his style of music two times at once so counting doing all western and 
a kid who i had taught when he was younger grew old enough he started playing with the orchestra 
name is carlos henriquez and from the afrolatin tradition so he grew up playing on claves so close enough 
like my little brother so always in mind so i said why is this we put it on and 
started to interpret what the doing this this is where one is this is what we need to si 
could translate for you wm he could translate for me so he translated for me and yacub one funny 
is he was playing a rhythm he said brother this is a royal rhythm a royal i said sound 
to me american man we have and he said is why you will never play it chuckle si he 
you up to that and you jumped right in wm you know what saying and kurt masur was the 
of the new york philharmonic he had grown up in germany during the period of the nazis and he 
me to write a piece for the philharmonic and he said he wanted the piece to celebrate humanity and 
coming together and he told me never forget he said have no idea of how thin the veneer and 
it can be pulled off and people will cheerlead the very opposite he said you be mindful of how 
all of this is and when you write this music be cognizant of the fragility and be strong in 
indictment of those things that are against human si well music speaks directly to our emotions right and for 
or for worse it can excite us for the good things and it can be used as propaganda for 
less good things what do you think about the state of jazz today if not too grandiose a question 
well i think most of the younger musicians are demoralized mainly commercial music interested in like the state of 
country we are consumed with rampant commercialism and a materialism that is destroying our human connections out front embarrassing 
kind of open corruption and we have to get on track and a long way away not because of 
president of course a shining symbol of it but not because of him si but it predates that yeah 
it predates long before that and i like when reduced to him because it keeps us from addressing the 
si deeper things going wm much deeper si than one guy yeah wm much deeper much deeper and we 
taught it to our kids used them as a market now being sold to and exploited from a very 
age they defend themselves not defending them and music is a large part of the exploitation and now pornography 
a fact of lives it leads them into their rituals of courtship and their development of course from an 
generation so i understand all of the nuances of it si the tinder and everything chuckle wm but no 
even so much a specific thing just how many acts you can see si right every generation lives in 
different world wm yeah well everybody says that but like working on a heart attack till you have it 
you tell somebody have a heart they say had okay you had one but gonna come a point where 
kind of descent gonna a thought that because always misinformation and the conflation of fact and always a kinda 
the past is better you touched on that too i love one thing you said i took my notes 
could get it on my phone but you said there are the gist of it is that there are 
plausible pasts than there are possible futures si exactly right right wm what you said so i love that 
right yeah wm the tendency is to always think the past was so glorious and not coming from there 
all si yeah gotta be forward yeah wm yeah just saying that kids are not a market and our 
of the market and of money has damaged our sense of the primacy of humanity and that that should 
first it should be first in our education left or right not from the right and not from the 
from all of it and starting to rot and we got to wake up si but tough you gotta 
a living if you wanna be a professional musician being a jazz musician is hard right wm let it 
hard si yeah you told the story about your father could you tell us that wm yeah i grew 
watching my father just struggle and not make money he was always playing for three and four people five 
people in a room and i just wondered over all these years why do you keep doing and he 
got to do but why people need this but here the people want this why his music has meaning 
to whom nobody is in here it means something to me and sometimes you have to be the one 
say the constitution has meaning i am going to be civil and not gonna just let the fact that 
me some money affect my ideology or affect that somebody was given a tax break means that we should 
policies that put people unjustly in jail and not just a problem of those people all those people and 
kind of super consciousness we have that type of leadership not of the president si no i get it 
wm and in no way am i a supporter of the agenda social agenda in no way you come 
my background and support using people mexican people and arabs and black people you support that coming from where 
come from but once again i wanna pin a national problem on a figure that is actually doing the 
of a large part of the nation si yeah and one of the ways i think about this is 
hard it is to be generous right to be generous to someone who we agree with how easy it 
to declare someone bad or evil because not on our side and how hard it is to work together 
people who are against us in some ways wm you ought to get in there like you were saying 
get in there with someone who has a different point of view who can help you sometimes you have 
figure that you cannot work with which may be the case in this instance but for our nation the 
that attacks all of us regardless of who the president is on an atomic level responsible si and written 
many things and you obviously have quite a discography and sometimes instrumentals sometimes words in there and your words 
pretty unsparing you mess around right wm no i very direct and i try to be as honest as 
can be as honest as i can be at the time with the information i have and everything is 
right but as right as i can when i write a piece that i think serious and i care 
like it and i mind him expressing that they like it one of the strengths of our way of 
si we shall strive for that attitude i would love to be able to do that what i try 
do yeah wm yeah we stop them si yeah yeah and do you see the younger people today are 
there a jazz following out there wm i see that much of a following with the younger people because 
young people are marketing trying to sell things to them and they are large their sexuality has been coopted 
visual images and jazz is about music and its quality you have to take the time and we are 
interested in teaching our younger people how to take time and to be a part of our way of 
si i do think room for optimism in the sense that technology etcetera has given people more room to 
creators to be innovators themselves is that too optimistic am i whistling dixie wm no no i think always 
teach a lot of students and i always tell them what gonna do i cannot see that i give 
some information that they can use in what gonna do but they have to do what they are going 
do and i try the biggest thing i see in my students is the ones who are really creative 
the greatest failure of optimism and of belief wm easy for them to become cynical and just say just 
make some money just gonna dump my music down i i need to get a public i just be 
hard to keep their belief strengthened so that they can be innovative as musicians because the music hearing a 
of it is like wallpaper like being made by a person on a computer and not a music is 
people are not even in the room at the same time making an artifact which can be very creative 
beings are creative in anything we do it matter for jazz musicians not optimal for us because our music 
very much human si sneaking looks over the bass player and the drummer right wm yeah yes si what 
are you gonna do next wm yeah about human beings and how we interact not about our tools that 
have developed si you play obviously a lot at lincoln center you played large concerts but there is something 
about being with one or two other people up there on a tiny stage right wm yeah i love 
but i love it in any context of course when in a small place also for me how i 
up so a small place with no people in it at home i get down to that in the 
what i knew si yeah jazz time as far as concerned wm yeah what i do si but not 
you do also been very successful in the classical music world and how do you mentally make that leap 
do you even see a difference between jazz and classical music wm it is a difference in the procedure 
training in the style of music but classical music is one of the foundations of jazz so i also 
that music i play as much but i do write pieces for orchestras and i use the experience i 
playing for many years i love playing in an orchestra playing all the great orchestral pieces and i do 
that a library that is so phenomenal that we sell our library short i always never forget about the 
of this library si so what are some of your favorite classical pieces wm man i could start with 
symphony of haydn all the beethoven symphonies beethoven string quartets all of music is great even matter what you 
to palestrina pope marcellus mass i like the name but an unbelievable piece bart√≥k concerto for orchestra stravinsky whatever 
take your pick you could just go on and on and on fantastic brahms fantastic library mahler strauss very 
i was able to develop the ability to hear that library in high school because when i started i 
that kind of music at all and i thought it was only for white people but to be able 
overcome that ignorance and that prejudice and actually listen to the music akin to a person who know what 
is if you can get to where you can hear john music or thelonious monk duke ellington count basie 
and a struggle you have to work on it but if you get to where you can hear it 
many unbelievable riches and classical music is man you shostakovich shostakovich seventh symphony if you can get to where 
can hear that i strongly encourage you to develop a taste for it because these were very very serious 
who sacrificed a great deal for music and had extreme insight into the nature of many things si and 
sort of especially if a kid just a coolness barrier when i first started listening to jazz sure miles 
john coltrane charlie parker and it was years later that i started listening to duke ellington and i was 
have i been what was i doing chuckle wm okay you know happening yeah i was like that too 
like duke big band music man like geritol old people si well exactly right like your grandparents listen to 
wm yeah we have the same experience with it and with that kind of quality music i feel of 
tradition it could be a tango music of i was listening to this my man i always forget i 
checking out my tango orchestras from the and and i was like listen to and the brazilian music of 
santos there are these figures in every culture that they would deeply engage with the music of their culture 
they created things that when we touch horacio salg√°n is the person i was looking for in tango music 
when you include them into your listening they lift you si yeah and do you incorporate classical elements into 
jazz composing and vice versa wm sure yes only natural you would use contrapuntal elements that come from classical 
harmonic devices orchestrational techniques why not what you would call metaphysical universe si no i know all the waves 
would there be the kind of improvisation that you do in jazz that would sneak its way sometimes pianists 
wm yeah when you write for classical musicians an orchestra no but i had an idea for one the 
day of how could you get everybody to improvise not in a vocabulary jazz like in a rhythmic vocabulary 
in a nonharmonic vocabulary i figured out how i wanna write a symphony with a lot of improvisation in 
you have to feel to figure out the improvisation not in the jazz context si right exactly wm you 
use the same forms but you have to give the different sections you have seventy people si well like 
said improvising multiple people at once actually you said something earlier today that was fascinating about just two trumpet 
up on stage and the phrase you used over and over again was and the trick right wm yeah 
share space complicated you and your wife you and your brothers or your sister you and yourself chuckle can 
make space for yourself now two of us so less and more at the same time less fusty but 
si right yeah more variety more inspiration more tension creative tension wm growth si yeah why so much improvisation 
done in the soloing context how often do we get five six seven people literally improvising wm well very 
but if you get five or six different functions you can get it if five or six of them 
playing in the same functional si the same role wm very hard for that to sound good unless the 
of it then it can sound great just be is a texture of five or six people si and 
played with country artists with rockandroll artists i only found out last night when i was anticipating this interview 
you did a whole album with eric clapton wm right it and we were playing blues si yeah well 
common language wm a common language our language is so much more common than the language we spoke with 
somebody like eric who loves blues and he studied it and played it he said we were gonna do 
band orchestration with blues songs so some of the basis of rock and roll is blues rock and roll 
as shuffles the count orchestra would play which became played by louis band and then it dum de dum 
dum de dum de dum de dum de dum went on to be that later it became segregated in 
and it stood for white but that had nothing to do with the music si i remember as i 
growing up and just a little bit after you and do you know living colour wm of course si 
i was a huge fan and i was shocked to learn that here was a rockandroll hard rock band 
were all african american and people objected to that they were like are these african americans doing playing rock 
i was like where did you come from that where it all wm yeah i so many different kind 
people i used to have a friend you would say say say a lot of si a lot of 
people say things yeah they do wm yeah i remember vernon reid i think si yeah vernon reid was 
guitarist for living colour yeah wm yeah i remember him doing new york in the si right exactly yeah 
now you waded into hot water recently right talking about hip hop wm not hot water to me si 
to like the hot water but so what are your feelings about hip hop for those wm i was 
speaking of hip hop as a field i was talking about specifically the use of certain words that i 
to be mainstream words i first thought of saying that in now is so the public has made its 
they like that they want that not forget the minstrel show lasted for one hundred years if you count 
thousand eight hundred forty to the end of amos andy a taste in our country for that i share 
taste so if it gets me in hot water because i say share and you wanna truncate what saying 
be a blanket indictment of hip hop and make it seem irrational nothing you could do about that grown 
you gotta say what you think wm a grown man and i believe that those words are destructive and 
have been destructive because been out here for thirty years they just get out here the nation has chosen 
like that okay i have to live with that but i have to like it si so you think 
wm i think what you think we all think something all we gotta do is look at it we 
to be attacked but we all think something si so there is socially conscious hip hop poetry in hip 
but sort of not winning right wm not talking about that kind yeah not talking about that kind si 
exactly wm and not talking about it itself in a blanket in any type of blanket kind of crazy 
way whatever it is this unintelligent it does not account for the fact that there are many different kinds 
a thing not talking about that talking about what is in the mainstream from a linguistic standpoint and not 
coming on it musically which qualified to but not not what i speak about si not gonna comment right 
chuckle wm not gonna comment about it no it matter the direction that all of our music is going 
a kind of way of being produced and a way of being treated as a product and to segregate 
hop from everything else is unfair si a very good point hip hop create the universe around it the 
way around wm no but what i speak about is very specifically about certain languages that i did not 
when it was first around then i was young so sometimes i see the universe just an old guy 
i was saying this before you were and once again the nation has clearly spoken it likes that but 
knew it liked my momma told me something when she when it stumbled into all of that talking about 
words i say i like calling people and all that my mother said gonna get unlimited resources si yeah 
i like hip hop when good of course whether good is up to me right wm as it is 
anybody as it is for everybody si but some of the classic albums some of the early ones i 
to harsh and kind of a shame wm up to each person and once again what we think about 
has no impact on who likes it not judges we have the opportunity or the ability to pass a 
on it and keep people from making their records this is a democracy si well we can make them 
wm maybe but been talking about it for years i think anybody thought about people are making money with 
and a national pastime not just something to do with black people si oh yeah not at all not 
wm a tremendous national taste for this type of imagery si yeah and not just in hip hop obviously 
right not just in hip hop not a fan of that not saying i think it should exist i 
it should be a mainstream so even qualifying it more if you wanna go somewhere and get stuff hey 
always had stuff that was like that si kendrick lamar just won the pulitzer prize in music you were 
is that right you were the first winner of the pulitzer prize in music that was not classical at 
wm i think so yeah si yeah yeah that was a great thing and i know a lot about 
world to me probably similar to the nobel prize in the sense that a lot of bad things about 
chasing prizes and things like that the prize always go to the best person but maybe it can help 
some attention to some good work wm yeah i know the prizes i prizes are as serious as the 
in which people who hand out the prizes have about them i think good for people to win prizes 
to celebrate other people and to show up in shows with tuxedos on because fun si i totally agree 
wm and it mean anything larger than that i really look at i remember when i won two grammys 
father and mother came out to los angeles and there were many other people who should have won could 
better than me so after the grammys i was in the room with my father and my father said 
me he said the not a guy hollywood kind of pop central he care about any of that so 
looked at me before i went out in the street to party he said you won two grammys glad 
won winning is better than then he seriously looked at me and said hope you think that this means 
can okay i was i understood exactly what he meant si but i think the whole point of winning 
grammy is to impress your parents wm i knew my father would not be impressed and he also was 
dousing me he trying he was just saying this stuff is not really si and you know what not 
fun but not about nothing like need to learn how to play son you play okay but not the 
at in his way have to know him in no way was it a negative or a dousing i 
actually i i said i know better than this we go out and party and have a good time 
win these so i congratulate people when they win awards and we keep it moving gonna be another award 
year and i look at them one way or not look at them not critical or noncritical si what 
your goals for your own music in the future wm to become better a better musician write better music 
better at dealing with the orchestra combine more forms and do more things that are interesting and innovative with 
music and putting become a better soloist be more sophisticated in my understanding of different forms around the world 
i would just be more dedicated and humble about my development si these are good goals for everybody but 
also here at this conference people talking about politics and science and everything and you are one of the 
up there on stage but you were also one of the people in the audience you were listening so 
mind is growing as well as your technique wm oh i loved it i loved your presentation and i 
a lot personally i took a lot of notes go back and study read books people said a luxury 
be able to sit up and hear unbelievably brilliant people talk dedicated think of all the dedication had and 
journey and another thing you learned as a jazz musician is the creativity is all over the world my 
used to always say many creative great people who wear signs saying creative great and learn how to put 
radar si you can find it wm and and believe me on it on this podcast on putting it 
in the morning checking you out no not just saying it on it i mean that gonna love being 
about the things that you talk about with the guests you have on and thoroughly enjoyed myself everything from 
developing cities to autism to the metoo movement to what you were talking about what julie was talking about 
interesting copying si did you have any or have you had any special interest in science in general or 
this wm i always loved science when i was growing up i loved all of the sciences i loved 
i always did pretty good as a student and chemistry and yeah i love the sciences i told you 
read the dancing wu li masters years ago and i am interested i need to be educated si an 
number of things that we all need to learn not gonna run out of interesting things to learn about 
we were having this interesting conversation the other night about entanglement quantum mechanics and maybe a connection with jazz 
in fact almost a cliche i know if you know stephon alexander do you know that name wm yeah 
do si a psychics professor at dartmouth who wrote a book called the jazz of physics wm he wrote 
book yeah yeah yeah the jazz of physics i read that book yet but yeah i know him si 
is a saxophone player wm yeah i know him yeah si yeah yeah yeah and part of me trained 
like trained to be a critic in music trained in science to be skeptical so i wanna make some 
claim so the claim would be that there is at least an analogy between we already talked about waves 
waves bumping into each other clearly part of music rhythm and so forth tone and pitch but also randomness 
but not a mess probability in quantum mechanics things exist until you observe them you bring them into existence 
maybe there is an analogy useful there between that unconscious solo that doing that until you play the note 
there you write it out ahead of time wm i think that repetition is a way that we control 
we have to repeat things i was talking with an artist and he was making me laugh he said 
the world new every day and i create new things every i said i equate that with being on 
laughter si can you stop and smell the roses a little bit chuckle wm we all have things gonna 
that touched on part of being in the system but if running not doing a lot of things that 
the same si true true and i think that we even mentioned before the balance between something different and 
that fits wm right si is sort of what looking for and that goes into what i said about 
in the sense that we start with the universe simple we end with the universe simple going up along 
way but in the middle where entropy is middle and complex structures are there and you know gonna happen 
so simple what fun wm right and you were saying trying to order them in a way that you 
order them to understand whatever you can understand si yeah we try to understand bit by bit wm right 
jazz gives you the opportunity to understand slices of reality not just from your perspective now you understand it 
much i call it the speed of instinct how fast is instinct man fast laughter you know what saying 
speed and playing on the edge always of instinct because always a present moment present moment present moment present 
and trying to come in that present like riding a wave now just going on that wave and other 
the presence of other people make you all like a multi like a hydra and perceiving them and perceiving 
form and perceiving the audience and perceiving you and all gonna gonna gonna gonna gonna and then boom then 
then you can listen to it and assess it when playing it you si right do you ever just 
out just like playing you even notice going on wm always like that only listening listening so intensely and 
to like just looking at something in the space dizzy gillespie told me he asked louis armstrong called me 
at four in the morning in los angeles he said you i said course man of course up only 
si only four wm he said i remember i went to the ophthalmologist and he said you wanna play 
look low when you wanna play middle register play it when you wanna play high look up and then 
told me he said i started doing he said i asked louis armstrong one i said why you always 
up high what are you looking and he said pops told him know brother diz but i always find 
si he was looking for some high notes up there wm he was looking under the haze looking up 
where his stuff is sometimes i tease musicians when on the bandstand and see them looking at it and 
know what looking at and say at it look at chuckle si focus on that wm when looking looking 
a point in space not looking at anything but trying to just hear and perceive everything going on and 
it and figure out do i fit into such an unbelievably exciting thing when done well si and i 
a book about time and the nature of time and how clocks tell time and everything and our bodies 
full of clocks our bodies are full of things that do the same thing in a rhythm over and 
again whether our heartbeat or our breathing or our nerves bouncing back and forth and i think that really 
music whether jazz or classical or whatever it feeds into that and draws from it like the rhythms inside 
come out in some interesting way wm i would love to gonna get the book but is you talked 
all the different clocks that are in the body if i looked at it would it give me an 
of what they are si no but i have friends who know that stuff laughter si yeah just a 
but yeah the body is far too complicated for me but it goes into some things can be taught 
some things are just in you i wanna say inherited but they come from places we understand wm instinctual 
yeah instinctual wm a thing but in jazz we called it a thing yeah you got that thing si 
anyone i sometimes heard the podcast interview neuroscientists did anyone ever try to put you in a brain scanner 
playing while improvising wm no somebody was talking about doing it with a band but we do it i 
love to do it si well david poeppel hook you up if you wanna do it wm good i 
love to do it si because his thing is different ways of looking inside the head to see what 
brain is doing this is stuff that developed over the last couple decades so you need to do surgery 
peek in at the brain you can do an mri which will show you where in the brain things 
happening but very slow so if even if just talking forget about improvising forget about playing fast you know 
happening but what you can also do happening in the brain are these chemicals zooming around and they make 
magnetic fields that pop outside your head and they can measure those right away wm man i would love 
see that what it would be like for a band really playing and improvise i would love my students 
do it and i told you i want you to talk to my students they would love it i 
great students at juilliard si love to do that yeah yeah yeah and i think coming because braincomputer interfaces 
is a common theme for me but i think that one of the things gonna change the future is 
ability to forget about our fingers just go right from the brain to the wm yeah like a si 
go back and forth and it might be very very slow and it might be one hundred years from 
so okay a physicist one hundred years is nothing but i think that yeah well be interesting to see 
we learn about music or about what it means some people are less musical like i sing a note 
i love listening to other people so great so wynton marsalis thank you so much for this fantastic conversation 
man such a pleasure i have so much respect and an honor and pleasure si and keep the journey 
yeah wm yes sir what both doing chuckle si alright thanks man wm yes sir thank you music pingback 
carrolls mindscape podcast wynton marsalis on jazz time and america three quarks daily music meets physics in coupled oscillation 
steven strogatz on firefly coupling httpswwwedgeorgconversationstevenstrogatzwhocaresaboutfireflies as you guys are saying about waves resonance etc how do you couple 
triple pattern with a double pattern the and the have the same period and then you have a neuroscientist 
the late walter freeman who talks of the nervous system as a bunch of complex oscillators people who are 
music together are coupled together into a single complex system as much as i will feel shame to admit 
the truth is when i originally read the synopsis for this episode my mind immediately felt that i find 
interest for me in this episode i appreciate music i love hearing great music but the truth is i 
nothing about reading music creating music or understanding music for that reason i believed this episode would be better 
to those who do have an intimate understanding of music i was completely wrong and the questions especially the 
provided by mr marsalis definitely provided interest for any listener i appreciate all the work that mr carroll and 
his guests undergo to provide public education i appreciate all of your podcasts thank you this was great an 
discussion definately explore music i was a bit embarrassed not to know him before the episode because i consider 
somewhat a jazz listener though my listening experience is limited mostly in the big names of to like coltrane 
davis herbie hancock etc dear dr carroll thank you for your excellent podcast if i may like to suggest 
possible future guests a literature expert perhaps specialized in someone like joyce a comparative religionmythology expert a meteorology expert 
in the chaos math behind weather prediction just some ideas keep up the great work comments are closed sean
