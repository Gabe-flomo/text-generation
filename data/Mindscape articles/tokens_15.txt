mindscape podcast your host sean carroll this is a special bonus episode outside the usual weekly numbered episodes and 
can guess why having this episode because of the coronavirus pandemic that the world is struggling with right now 
i thought it would it would be useful even if very quickly and without much preparation to get some 
the information out about the science behind it and also the steps that are being taken and that individuals 
take already a huge amount of information out there of course so plenty of places to get it i 
that saying anything or my guest tara smith will be saying anything on this episode that is completely surprising 
anyone who has been following sensible reliable sources out there but very helpful to put it into context to 
it all into one place and a lot of unreliable sources out there that maybe this can act as 
corrective to sc so to put things in context recording this on the morning of wednesday march for those 
you in the future who might be listening to this episode the first case as far as i can 
the first case of the disease which is called associated with this novel coronavirus was discovered in china i 
the day before new years last year december the first case in the us was january right now worldwide 
to the website looking at worldometersinfo there are known coronavirus cases that have been found of course in the 
and about in the united states of course only things that found literally as typing this a story came 
on my feed from the new york times saying that for every known case of the coronavirus another five 
ten cases might be out there undetected sc so still in the exponential growth phase of this virus growing 
very quickly here where i am in los angeles a week ago people were going to the gym people 
going to the restaurants we knew there was an issue already colleges and schools had begun to close people 
trying to do a little bit of social distancing but life was still almost normal since then all the 
have shut down the gyms have shut down people are trying to get food delivered people are stocking up 
the grocery stores at least the grocery stores are still open as of wednesday march but places like san 
have an even sterner set of rules that have been put down sheltering in place leave your house unless 
necessary sc and a weird situation because you know not everyone dies right different levels of fatality and injury 
with this but you can get the virus not die and yet spread it to someone else who might 
pass away because of it so it absolutely makes super duper sense to take these social distancing and selfquarantining 
steps seriously so i had this wonderful conversation with tara smith who is an epidemiologist a professor at kent 
university to be honest mostly studies bacterial infections not viral infections like this is but the idea of infections 
pandemics and what to do about them very much up on and also a wonderful communicator about these things 
a very clear very you know cleareyed and helpful useful practical set of comments that she offers and also 
know we talk about the underlying science you know if mindscape listeners you want to know the difference between 
bacterial and a viral infection you want to know that there are some rnabased viruses and dnabased viruses and 
forth so where gonna learn that look i hope everyone is staying safe out there doing what you can 
know i hope that none of my listeners are out there partying with thousands of people just to show 
virus boss because not how it works sc little we can do in a practical way maybe when far 
to help each other but important to maintain contact with other people call up your friends send them emails 
people who you might have lost touch with people who are in higher risk groups things like that about 
start to doing a little series of videos where i talk about big ideas in physics not because this 
anything to do with viruses or pandemics but something for me to do and be qas so share with 
people because we have to be very very safe and careful but we also have to live our lives 
what better thing to do than to use this terrible terrible situation as an excuse to come out the 
side better informed about the universe in which we live why here so go music sc tara smith welcome 
mindscape podcast tara smith thank you for having me sc well thank you for doing this short notice bonus 
for our listeners because of course the conditions are a little strange a little surreal laughter sc i mean 
professional epidemiologist is something like was this in your space of things you wondered about before or is this 
totally different ts oh sure i mean when i was at university of iowa in the earlytomid we were 
about pandemic influenza and avian influenza particularly and so we did a bunch of what we call tabletops where 
have a scenario you know usually a bad one sc yeah ts and you try to figure out what 
happen and what departments you need to call in what people you need to call in who will do 
who will do that looking exactly at things that are in the news right now how many ventilators do 
have how many icu beds how can we triage people into the right places so that we overwhelm healthcare 
then we had the swine flu pandemic in which ended up being more mild than typical influenza pandemics are 
then with this administration i think pandemic preparedness has not been a sc a priority yeah ts right right 
big priority so definitely something epidemiologists and people who do these types of work have thought about but i 
gotten back burnered in the last few years unfortunately sc yeah well so i do wanna get to the 
of how we might cure it what we should be doing in the meantime but back up a little 
we have time to get a slightly deeper understanding so talk to me about viruses and even epidemics pandemics 
general the difference between epidemic and a pandemic the difference between viruses and bacteria all that good stuff ts 
so start with viruses and bacteria so viruses are basically just nucleic acids that replicate within a host so 
big argument are they alive or are they not which not gonna answer today even microbiologists agree sc done 
in another podcast actually so worry about it yeah ts yeah i have done that all over and not 
virologist i would say my work is on bacteria but viruses basically hijack the machinery so they enter into 
cell they force that host cell to replicate copies of the viral nucleic acid be it rna or dna 
then the host cell basically spits those out so they can go to other cells and replicate and do 
same thing and so we generally do consider them live because then we have what we call killed virus 
where we basically inactivate that nucleic acid so it can no longer replicate so we use those for things 
influenza so you can at least chemically speaking kill a virus sc sorry is that by literally changing its 
or by just changing its chemical structure ts right so a little bit of both so it depends on 
way you inactivate it so you can inactivate it with chemicals like formaldehyde that will basically stop it from 
you can also inactivate it with uv that will basically do the same thing introduce mutations it replicate any 
sc okay ts so so those are the viruses and then bacteria of course are alive on their own 
can grow outside of the body they have nutritional requirements they have their own metabolism which makes them different 
viruses which again just take the metabolic machinery and use that to replicate so yeah tend to be ones 
can live outside the body and yeah chuckle not sure sc are is the threat just to the future 
the threat from bacterial pandemics just as big or virus is really the enemy here ts right we have 
pandemics as well i think they get as much attention because they seem to come on quite as dramatically 
ones that often more familiar with so of course tuberculosis is a bacterium sc okay ts one of the 
infectious disease killers across the globe especially in combination with hiv virus but people are familiar with tb again 
ancient disease so i think not the fear of that not the exotic system about it not the novelty 
then of course i research antibiotic resistance sc yeah ts we are seeing increasing amounts of antibiotic resistance including 
bacteria like tuberculosis which makes many of these bacterial species essentially untreatable or very difficult to treat very expensive 
treat and so concerned about returning to this preantibiotic era but that seems like i think more like climate 
a slow burn versus the sc yeah not quite dramatic ts very dramatic a thing that is this viral 
so i think people just fear that as much concerned about that as much because not that kind of 
onset like seen with influenza pandemic in or with sars in two thousand two and which we got under 
but was still very dramatic and very frightening and then of course coronavirus right now sc and is the 
why the antibiotic resistance is going down is that in part because people are sanitizing their hands far too 
ts one way not a big driver not the sanitizing the hands that there are some formulations that really 
anymore as far to my knowledge that contains a antimicrobial called triclosan sc okay ts and that has the 
to drive antibiotic resistance but most of the hand sanitizers out now just have alcohol rubbing alcohol basically so 
quite the same selective pressure as some of those that did contain that antimicrobial product which is still present 
some things like toothpaste and other types of cleaning products sc yeah gonna be happy with it being in 
okay chuckle okay with me not gonna object to that ts fine sc okay so get into actually very 
i do have a better understanding now of why viruses that seem to be popping up in these scenarios 
talk about this one in particular the simplest question is what should we be calling it the coronavirus the 
coronavirus the novel coronavirus can you distinguish between the nomenclature ts right right so the nomenclature is a bit 
a mess even in professional circles so is a name for the disease so when you are ill with 
you have sars coronavirus two is the official name for the virus which many people happy about because they 
want to bring back in the spectra of sars but the official name for now which is kind of 
mouthful and very formal so i have gone to using hashtag just coronavirus because what i see most commonly 
not a big fan of that either because of course there are other coronaviruses there are four different mild 
that circulate that just common colds and then of course there was the mers coronavirus and sars coronavirus which 
the more serious diseases as well so coronavirus is a family sc i think maybe worth emphasizing i think 
maybe not everyone completely knows this the coronavirus is like a family been around for a while that known 
this is a particular kind that dealing with right now ts right exactly so why initially it was just 
the novel coronavirus to distinguish it from all those other ones that we had already known about before so 
particular genomic sequence is new to us we had not seen this particular lineage this particular virus infect people 
but we did know about others in that coronavirus family previously sc and we do have the complete genome 
the new one is that right ts we do we have many which is one of the things they 
looking at to try to figure out how spreading and also potentially where it came from sc okay so 
did it come from laughter sc a whole story right yeah ts so what looking at right so the 
that looks most responsible right now are bats so we know that bats harbor a huge amount of viruses 
things like ebola and marburg and nipah and hendra which are some of these viruses that emerged in the 
and we knew before that bats were implicated in the emergence of some of these other highly pathogenic coronaviruses 
sars in the early and then mers in the last decade but with sars and mers they also had 
animals involved so that means that even though they ultimately originated in a bat they jumped into another animal 
they jumped into humans so with sars we think it was a civet cat which is kind of a 
type of animal and we think that was the one that really transmitted it to people and with mers 
this over and over again that it seems to be camels that camels are infected with this sc oh 
that one ts and then yeah people so saudi arabia and other places that have close contact with camels 
are most likely to be infected so what sc and when sorry when it jumps is it exactly the 
virus or does it need to modify to jump from species to species ts right they seem to be 
we call preadapted to make those jumps so these are ones that do not have to undergo extensive evolution 
humantohumantohuman to become transmissible within people but they are ready to go from the outsets they already bind to 
on the host in the humans so they can go they are ready to go and so what trying 
figure out with this one is is there an intermediate animal involved here and of course there were some 
that maybe pangolins can be involved but still trying to figure that out they have a smoking gun there 
yet sc and how are they doing this is this like boots on the ground in china trying to 
a bunch of animals ts right yeah and looking retrospectively so there was already a paper out about a 
ago or so that had actually tested some coronavirus is coming out of pangolins and then there was previous 
on bats so some of this has been done already and then they can take the new viruses and 
them to those databases and finding pretty similar matches again the best match so far are to bat coronaviruses 
some of the pangolin ones are not an exact match but decent so trying to figure out whether those 
be that intermedia species or not but that requires more sampling sc are viruses just especially good at mutating 
their dna a little bit looseygoosey compared to more evolved animals ts yeah it depends so some viruses really 
a rapid evolution measles virus is very similar you can take ones from the and very similar to the 
we use that we see today why the vaccine has been so successful and longlasting because they really changed 
much but then you have something like influenza why we have to get our vaccines every year sc every 
ts right it mutates a little bit it drifts is what we call it just enough so that those 
were exposed the year before their immune system no longer recognizes those virus after they change in that subsequent 
so it really depends coronavirus seems to be a little bit in the middle also an rna virus like 
but it has some correcting mechanisms so that all of the mutations it has some of them are corrected 
it mutate as fast as influenza sc actually maybe i think getting this wrong so an rna virus so 
means it have dna ts right so the nucleic acid is rna so it would oh boy making me 
back to my all my molecular biology so it would be translated to dna in the host cell sc 
okay got it ts right but it infects the cell as an rna virus sc and there are some 
that are dna viruses directly and others are not ts right exactly sc okay ts and again not a 
sc yeah ts i wanna put that out there once again sc yeah neither am i okay good slugging 
from recollections i think small pox is a dna virus so there are some that have dna as there 
nuclei acid and others that have rna sc and when you mentioned influenza never actually looked into this but 
course every year sort of a different strain of the flu that goes around and you get your vaccine 
vaccine yeah ts yeah yeah sc and is it just one or why is it sort of everywhere in 
world the same flu going around or is it more subtle than that ts right so what we do 
is they have laboratories that will examine influenza all year round and so take samples and see circulating in 
population and so of course influenza has seasonality so you see peaks in the fall and winter so while 
our influenza season those in the southern hemisphere are looking very closely at what viruses are circulating here and 
viceversa when our summer and looking at their viruses that are circulating during their influenza season so we usually 
what viruses will go in the vaccine i think usually the meeting occurs in february i believe but again 
on that surveillance what is going on in the southern hemisphere and what do we think is going to 
circulating here then during our winter so they will choose usually four strains there are two types of influenza 
are in the yearly vaccine so influenza a which is usually the worst one usually can the most virulent 
then influenza b as well which is the one that usually hits kids harder so pick strains for each 
those that will be included in the vaccine for the fall and then they spend basically the rest of 
spring and summer making the vaccine getting it ready for distribution and then so ready to be injected into 
shoulder by fall sc so i realized that the vaccine is actually sort of a cocktail that picks out 
it thinks are the most likely strains not just that one strain universally but a few and aiming for 
biggest impact ts right exactly so the most common vaccine is what we call quadrivalent so it would have 
strains of those so that protected against the most common types that are circulating sc okay alright and what 
the difference then between the this novel sars coronavirus and the typical influenza ts right so they cause similar 
both respiratory viruses transmitted in similar ways through what we call large droplets so coughing sneezing the virus comes 
in those coughs and sneezes lands on surfaces you touch things you pick it up on your hands you 
your face you touch your eyes you touch your nose and basically inoculate yourself so transmission and some of 
symptoms are similar so influenza you tend to get hit with usually a high fever that comes with a 
a pretty rapid onset body aches what we call malaise just that general feeling miserable cough runny nose upper 
issues sore throat so with you see typically a fever and a dry cough you see as many of 
other upper respiratory symptoms like a runny nose those types of symptoms seem to be less common with you 
see a sore throat you can have some body aches but that also seems to be less common so 
in a lot of ways but of course with influenza we know much more about it we have vaccines 
have treatments with we are in our infancy understanding any of that there so even though superficially they are 
in some of those ways the knowledge base for those is just so much deeper for influenza than we 
for coronavirus sc so even though the symptoms share some relationship the actual virus is a very different kind 
thing ts right right exactly yeah but even that there are again some similarities they both do have rna 
their nucleic acids but as i mentioned before coronaviruses at least this one do have some proofreading that they 
use so it seem to mutate as quickly as influenza sc some error correction or something like that ts 
exactly sc yeah alright now you make me think about quantum error correction which is entirely different thing which 
should not get distracted by so let me do that but good this so maybe at the point where 
can dig in a little bit more to what it means when you say when you get the disease 
the difference between this particular virus and which is the disease talk me through the steps of getting the 
in me getting infected getting the disease showing symptoms these are all different things right ts right and where 
honestly still figuring out is exactly the pathology of this so what does it do to the body when 
virus enters and causes damage and just starting to learn that again with influenza we know the basics it 
the lung cells usually what you get are secondary infections like secondary bacterial infections so the lungs get damaged 
the virus bacteria are able to take advantage of that they settle in usually where you get a lot 
your serious infections with influenza they tend to be mostly bacterial pneumonias and sometimes even sepsis where the bacteria 
enter the blood ts so what you see with flu with some of the reports are all over the 
so you still seem to have these serious respiratory symptoms so one of the reasons this was identified in 
initially was that these patients were getting what they call acute respiratory distress syndrome or ards but they were 
for influenza so they tested them for flu and they were negative but they were seeing these really extreme 
symptoms in some cases they needed to be put on ventilators and of course in some cases people passed 
from this so what trying to figure out is exactly how the virus does that how damaging the cells 
the lungs what is the role of secondary infections because many cases have been seen with some of these 
bacterial infections kind of like flu but others ts so just the virus alone causing this pathology and then 
people have had serious cardiac effects so we see that as much with flu flu can aggravate heart conditions 
well but in this case i seen reports at least yet about exactly how the virus is causing those 
conditions if it is directly causing a viral heart infection or myositis boy obviously not a clinician but basically 
infecting the hearts with the virus itself so i suspect gonna be seeing a lot more of those case 
and analysis coming out once physicians have time to do some of these analysis from some of the cases 
the united states sc sure right now trying to stop people dying yeah ts right exactly priorities right sc 
ts so seen some case reports some of again not only case reports but large aggregates of this data 
thousands of cases in china but some of those can you find granular details still figuring out and some 
those we be able to figure out wholly from human infections because of course you always follow them through 
you get a person come in at the last minute very ill they die in the hospital so people 
trying to establish animal models for this infection as well where they can purposely infect animals and be able 
detail that pathology a little bit more again in granular detail sc okay can i have the virus in 
and be completely asymptomatic ts we think so and another big question and one that we have great data 
yet the evidence does show that you can transmit the virus while you are still incubating it but show 
yet so we call this the incubation period which is the time between when you were exposed to the 
so someone had it someone was expelling it from their nose and throats and you picked it up somehow 
then the time that you develop symptoms so when you first start to feel that cough coming on or 
headache or that sore throat that fever so it does appear that you can spread the virus while you 
not showing symptoms but whether someone can do it and be completely asymptomatic so they never show symptoms they 
develop that fever or cough or anything like that still kind of a black box sc okay ts not 
that those people never develop symptoms some evidence for that but what we really need to prove that is 
do good serological testings so to go out in the population take blood look for antibodies to this in 
who never had symptoms and those are starting in china but again priorities sc yeah other things going on 
ts yeah exactly sc so that was the sort of typhoid mary kind of thing right where one person 
be just have no symptoms of the disease be perfectly healthy looking and yet be spreading it all over 
place ts right exactly and we think kind of happened again in that presymptomatic phase so there are some 
of people who were by their accounts not yet symptomatic they feel ill yet but they were interacting with 
of people and probably spread it to them too but then they got sick like the day later or 
like that so again been a lot of questions about this in the media and even in science circles 
so i think the better phrase for that is presymptomatic rather than asymptomatic so see how that pans out 
i mean i have seen some claims on twitter which i take to be entirely reliable chuckle sc that 
have apparently been able to carry the virus around without showing any ill effects is that something i be 
and yeah another big question so again a contrast that with flu with influenza children are huge drivers of 
infection i mean anyone who has sc yeah ts knows kids are so germy and always sick when a 
and just starting daycare kindergarten or something and oh horrible and so with flu especially during a flu pandemic 
shutting down schools is so important because the kids are the they can be again infectious well before they 
symptoms and then even after they recover after they have been sick and now not feeling ill anymore they 
still be shedding virus so they can still go out and spread that to grandma or somebody else even 
they feel fine with the new virus the new coronavirus we just know we know that kids do not 
to be showing a lot of serious symptoms there were some studies in china that suggested that if you 
more testing in kids and look for more mild infections you do find them in kids sc right ts 
again how much actually driving that spread and whether doing it when they have a mild infection or during 
presymptomatic phase or if they may be completely asymptomatic are infected with the virus and never show symptoms is 
also still trying to figure out and a key question because again many places have shut down schools sc 
ts we are in a complete shutdown throughout the state of ohio with all of our schools for an 
period of time sc yeah ts and whether that will help or not we really honestly know yet sc 
it might it might help a huge amount ts it might it might we hope it will we hope 
will sc and i mean heard reports that some people get it and if they are relatively young and 
not so bad for them whereas heard other reports like no no really can you give us a feeling 
the spread of virulence i guess no probably not virulence but the severity of the symptoms once you do 
it ts right so and again looking primarily at chinese data but also some coming out now from italy 
south korea does show that again young people can get this but their case fatality rate so if the 
of those who die out of the percentage of those who get it does seem to be very low 
zero not nonexistent definitely they can still die from it but compared to older age groups and unfortunately it 
to increase starting at about which is bad for me sc i know chuckle sc i remember back when 
would have laughed at this but okay ts right right but yeah they are just much lower than those 
are even a couple of decades older than they are so not zero not like you can just put 
or teenagers or out on the frontline and that they will never get it and they could never pass 
it can happen but we are definitely seeing much lower fatality rates in those groups than in older ages 
and it seems again correct me if wrong but it seems like this correlation with age is more than 
older people are more frail or have other respiratory infections it seems like just for some reason it hits 
people much more severely ts right and again one of the things trying to work out right now in 
also we also saw this gender skew so that it only older people but it was especially older men 
were getting this and so there were some thoughts there and i think seeing that in a little bit 
the data from italy as well but there were some thoughts especially in china it may be related to 
so that if you have more older men and more likely to be smokers more likely to have some 
damage already then maybe the reason why it is hitting that group so much harder even compared to women 
the same age sc okay ts so i know i seen any tests of that hypothesis where digging that 
yet they may be out there but it has been such a flood of research papers hard to keep 
sc sure ts but that definitely was one thing they were looking at and then of course there are 
attendant heart issues as you age you are more likely to have high blood pressure or other issues with 
function and so if this is a virus that truly does also independently cause heart problems as well that 
be another reason why seeing that in those of older ages as well sc but i guess that makes 
to me the idea that not actually technically the age that matters but some sort of accumulated lowlevel damage 
your lungs and maybe your cardiac system that makes you more susceptible to getting severe symptoms of this disease 
right and again we are still figuring all of that out sc no just a wild speculation do not 
me i am not an epidemiologist much less a clinical practitioner or anything like that and so that was 
information but i just wanna sort of boil it down a little bit so people can get can be 
by the way does the technical definition of infected just mean i have the virus in my body or 
it something more definite ts right it means replicating in your body sc okay got it so i can 
infected i have the disease replicating in my body before i show symptoms and and then i can start 
symptoms so one transition is not infected to infected another is not showing symptoms to i am but the 
one is i can become contagious and one of the issues here with this particular strain is that you 
become contagious before you show symptoms ts what it seems to be showing and we know again how much 
individuals are driving transmission versus those who are symptomatic and are coughing and sharing this with others and being 
close contact with their families and things like that so again one of the other things that trying to 
out and there was a model out a couple of days ago that suggested the presymptomatic transmission so those 
who are out walking around still feeling well but can spread the virus are accounting from maybe a quarter 
more of new cases so you have about a one in four chance that that person who is not 
symptomatic but is infected is replicating the virus is shedding the virus into the environment that they may be 
a quarter of the cases or so sc right wow a lot ts and that could be updated tomorrow 
knows working out of all this incomplete information sc yeah of course no no exactly very very rapid well 
would mention to people funny but also obviously in retrospect true just a couple days ago when i asked 
to do this i said there anything i should read and like will be outdated by the time we 
the how fast things are moving ts so hard to keep up with this the thing again some of 
gaps that we have there are papers coming out every day that are starting to fill some of those 
trying to keep up with this and most of it is in preprints which i know for physics you 
have been doing that forever but for biology and medicine still pretty new to us and so trying to 
a hold of how what the best way is to and filter some of this information has been one 
the challenges of this outbreak sc well this is getting ahead of ourselves a little bit but i think 
a good example of the ways in which i wanna put a positive spin on it but people are 
out of their complacency by things like this and sometimes you can actually learn something by that right you 
have emergency kits and first aid in your house and things like that but you have to go through 
like this to get there ts right and plans plans for this too yeah sc and plans yeah yeah 
if i were a super villain and designing a virus to wipe out all my enemies and my enemies 
everybody what i would want to do is have it keep people as asymptomatic for as long as possible 
they were still contagious and then eventually after being asymptomatic for several months it would turn on and kill 
right ts right sc and this quite that because it turn on and kill everybody but it it is 
to spread amazingly effectively because of this contagion before symptomatic ts right it does seem that way and that 
been one of the key issues when talking so talking about how to respond to this sc yeah ts 
usually what we tried to do and what we did with sars was containment so that means that you 
basically stop the spread if you identify all those cases you identify who has not only been infected and 
is showing symptoms and who is potentially spreading it to others you get those infected people into isolation so 
around other people sc yeah ts but then you also do really good basically shoe leather epidemiology you ask 
so who did you have contact with what stores did you go into what locations did you and you 
trace all of those people they had they were in touch with anyone who was at those stores between 
hours or things like that and you have them go into quarantine which means they have been exposed but 
are not yet ill themselves so really how we extinguished sars but sars was a little bit different in 
it seem to spread efficiently during that incubation period during that time when not yet showing symptoms so what 
try to do initially with this and when you saw cases elsewhere but really that presymptomatic transmission is what 
messing everything up so that is why we have gone from containment to mitigation to just trying to stop 
effects of this and trying to use things like social distancing and school closures and increasing hygiene just to 
to blunt the effects of this virus on society basically knowing that containment is gonna be difficult to impossible 
of that presymptomatic transmission sc yeah i wanna get into the details of the strategies taking against it so 
last question before we get there is there seemed to how long does it take to become symptomatic there 
to be a range like some people are saying well they got it just a couple of days after 
some people are saying as long as fourteen days or longer for the person out there wondering was on 
plane a certain number of days ago worried at what point can they say i gotten ts right and 
a range because it will depend on a lot of things it will depend on what your exposure was 
the virus what dose of virus were you exposed to so did somebody hack on you in close quarters 
something like that where they could have expelled a lot of that virus onto you or did you touch 
that had just a small amount of virus on it and so it will take a lot longer for 
virus to replicate in your body to the point where you get symptoms and also just is your immune 
robust are you immunocompromised that can also play a role in the length of that time period so we 
give it in a range from what seen this is an average of maybe six to seven days or 
but it can definitely go up to at least some case reports where it goes up to maybe twentyone 
but that seems to be pretty rare so they do say usually about three to fourteen days is the 
range with six or seven being the most common most common point sc interesting yeah so i was on 
plane twoandahalf weeks ago so i think that okay but it was coming from australia before things really got 
but you do it is tough you wonder right ts right sc if something has happened so move into 
we should be doing i know that the online conversation is constantly evolving there was a big wave of 
the curve which is just slow down the rate of infections so the hospitals get overwhelmed but now getting 
backlash against flattening the curve and all about testing now so do you have well before you even have 
opinion what we should be doing like what are we doing and is it a good set of things 
ts right so again the emphasis has been on the hand washing not touching your face which i know 
people said that everyone realized how difficult that is sc i even try that i cannot sorry i try 
be a good citizen but touching my face is going to happen and by the way so soap right 
are really into the antibacterial disinfectants but soap is apparently even better for this particular virus ts yes soap 
better in general for any kind of hand hygiene so we recommend if around soap and water do that 
you have access i carry around hand sanitizer but for those places where i have access to a sink 
so if going in a building and touching elevator buttons or something like that and not a restroom close 
you can use hand sanitizer okay but soap and water is definitely preferred sc twenty seconds ts twenty seconds 
all the surfaces of your hands get under your nails all of that chuckle ts absolutely whatever you choose 
know there have been so many circulating sc there are a lot of little songs to sing i do 
a slightly contrary and take here that maybe you can disabuse me of which is the following i worry 
the emphasis on washing your hands for twenty seconds can be counterproductive if it makes people wash their hands 
frequently like if so much of a burden to wash your hands could you at least make the argument 
just better to be constantly washing your hands whenever you get the chance rather than twice a day just 
a really good job ts oh yeah so a bacteriologist worked in a lab for years my view of 
world is that everything is contaminated chuckle ts so anything you touch basically if you just washed your hands 
now you touch that doorknob and contaminated yourself again so i do it as often as possible especially when 
public spaces and especially during a pandemic so i also often carry a little bottle of lotion with me 
i know that it can be hard on the hands to wash them very frequently but when out there 
public you just know so i just assume that every surface is contaminated then go from there sc good 
a whole bunch of questions that i can be asking like are masks useful social distancing but why i 
you talk for a second about what do you think is going on and how effective it could be 
right so the biggest goal of course is to just decrease that number of contacts every person has every 
so we know on average each person who is incubating this virus who has it and can spread to 
will spread it to somewhere between two to three people on average okay some people again have spread it 
like some people will be infected and will not be in contact with anyone else they will spread to 
but why we go with that average number right sc yeah ts so what trying to do with this 
distancing is to decrease the number of contacts you have per day so if only in your house only 
your family at least you will have a minimal number of contact with other individuals who could potentially spread 
virus so the goal and the goal is to again not necessarily extinguish this because gonna be really difficult 
yeah ts but to slow it and again not only just because we want to decrease transmission of the 
but because we want to mitigate those serious infections so the people especially again elderly and older people and 
with preexisting conditions who might have really serious infections and spread those out more over time so that there 
be enough beds in the icu and so that there will be enough ventilators and other types of medical 
so that we can respond to those people who need serious care and also of course have the healthcare 
available to respond to that over time so the basics behind the extreme social distancing seeing and the mantra 
flatten the curve sc so just to be clear in favor of social distancing all seen these pictures online 
people saying healthy it hurt me to go out on a pub crawl or whatever to go to a 
is a little bit crazy am i not wrong chuckle ts right yeah so at kent state university we 
everything is planned together a week ago or more that we were going to move the rest of our 
to completely online classes so that again we can reduce lectures of students and reduce all of these transmissions 
then this past weekend one of our local taverns had a coronavirus party sc oh my goodness ts so 
were a lot of students there there were some of the frats that held parties so we had pictures 
just this past weekend after all of this has been going on with lots of students together so i 
that not typically in these higher risk groups obviously not because of their age but they can spread it 
others who are so yeah so trying to get that through especially to the younger people i think that 
if they will probably be okay they could be coming in contact with their elderly neighbor or start a 
of transmission from themselves to their mother to their grandmother or something like that and could end up with 
seriously ill or dying so i think we have to think about how we are all in this together 
even if your individual risk may be low if we can break some of those chains of transmission you 
be protecting other people that you love sc yeah even just a week ago i of course i want 
fly on airplanes or be in large lecture halls or concerts but i figured like going to a restaurant 
going to the gym would probably be okay and now like that was just crazy why would i have 
ts well evolved so fast a week ago we have as many cases and now new york just announced 
one thousand more over night so seeing this real jump in cases everywhere and states that are reporting cases 
things so i think it feels much more real maybe to people this week than it did even a 
ago sc well the nba has ended its season right with celebrities tom hanks idris elba and others have 
that they have tested positive i think it brings it home to people in a different way ts i 
i do too i agree sc but okay so how far should we go so in favor of shutting 
all the restaurants here in la done that no more restaurants you which is obviously gonna be devastating to 
restaurant industry and the service industry more generally you can get take out and you can even get delivery 
shut down all the gyms and things like this but we the supermarkets are still open right people kind 
waiting in line do you think at a sensible level of restrictions now or should we go further have 
gone too far ts yeah i think so hard i completely understand that this is livelihoods in the balance 
that even if we do mitigate the spread of the virus and the physical effects that that has on 
there are a lot of things that is gonna worsen right a lot of the mental health already i 
bad for the extroverts an introvert so i can handle this chuckle sc yeah ts but already after three 
people are missing that contact and so i feel really bad for them and i have an uncle who 
a cafe and he is trying to do everything with takeout gonna take a big hit to him and 
employees so again i wish we had had a good plan for this beforehand so that we knew what 
in those financial situations could do and we have to worry about them as much as kind of collateral 
for some of this but we so trying to figure out as we go and some of these places 
we need the supplies you completely shut down grocery stores for eight weeks because even those who were kinda 
for this the general recommendation was to be prepared to hunker down for about two weeks i mean how 
people can have two months worth of supplies just sitting at home sc nope not here ts right just 
reasonable to expect so obviously we still need a lot of those services we still have to have people 
in paychecks and buying their own food and paying their own rent so i think we have to figure 
a way and something quickly to really help people who are affected by this in other ways i do 
the right thing as far as controlling virus spread but we have to do that in such a way 
it harm individuals in other ways and i think the part still trying to be worked out i will 
in ohio i was really glad that before they shutdown the schools lots of places did have things set 
so that these kids who were getting lunches and breakfast at schools they are still able to get those 
of them have kind of a pickup come and pick up a boxed lunch or something so that they 
still get that still getting fed our school took a survey and gave laptops and internet hotspots to people 
have no internet access at home and no computer at home so i think some of those things are 
done again kind of figure out maybe a little bit last minute chuckle ts but what the types of 
that you have to do to try to do this over time and again really basically one week into 
and i have no idea how all of this is gonna go and how long people are gonna be 
to do this type of thing sc well i think you make a good point because clearly a sort 
a continuum right a spectrum like of course if we just insisted which is almost what san francisco is 
right now but if we just insisted everyone just stay home then we could in fact limit the propagation 
the virus on the other hand negative effects to doing that right both health and physical health and mental 
i mean let me give you an example so food delivery is supposed to be good right not all 
together in a restaurant but heard recommendations that ask the delivery person to just set down the food on 
doorstep and then you come pick it up without ever touching them or at least holding the bag at 
same time as touching it is that kind of just like going a little bit too far or is 
actually completely prudent and wise ts i mean i think prudent if you can do it because again i 
those delivery people if you have facetoface contact with every single person that out delivering food to gonna put 
at risk and then also gonna put potentially all those customers at risk so i think as much as 
to try to mitigate that persontoperson interaction gonna help us in the long run i know so hard for 
people to i totally understand they wanna chat up the delivery person or something instead of just get their 
at the doorstep sc yeah yeah okay good no i think a good point even though it seems maybe 
little precious it is a simple thing to do compared to other things right ts right exactly easy to 
sc right so good so i have a few other examples of things that trying to do and you 
tell me whether good ideas or not and i predict ahead of time gonna tell me all good ideas 
ts okay sc forgetting about restaurants just like having friends over to your house probably something we should try 
minimize as much as possible right ts yeah at first again you just never know if somebody has been 
or somebody could be incubating that virus you just know sc yeah what about touching surfaces chuckle at various 
like i know we have to go to the supermarket you do have to get food and there is 
sensible recommendation buy as much as you can every trip to minimize your number of trips but how much 
i worry about the fact that you know even knowing it or not touching the shelves touching a bag 
like that are some kinds of surfaces more dangerous ts right well things that so when we think about 
surfaces we think for the most part about high touch surfaces so those are the ones that are shared 
a lot of people so the shelves themselves people are probably not gonna be running their hands along the 
shelf but things like at the register if you have a pen pad or a pen to sign things 
are the things a lot of people are going to have shared and touched as they check their food 
so again recommend once done with that once done in the supermarket again throw your hand sanitizer or something 
they have maybe you go in the bathroom and wash your hands if you have a cart full of 
carry your hand sanitizers so that you can at least rub that on your hands before you get into 
car and touch your steering wheel and everything else and then we have put in the ritual especially with 
kindergartener that every time we come home first thing we do we got a bathroom right inside the door 
wash your hands so i think just been trying to make that normal now no matter where we were 
come in you wash your hands sc well you mentioned the touch pads apparently phones are another place even 
not sharing your phone around your phone has been all over the place does it make sensible to be 
your phone screen ts yeah i mean the phones can get really gross and most of it is that 
mostly bacteria that come from you typically but you if at the grocery store and you text somebody on 
way home now you transmitted some of that to your phone so yeah and i know there is a 
have been a couple of articles about how to disinfect your phone i usually i just have my alcohol 
that i will use but i have a screen protector so it just goes on that so i have 
worry about it damaging my phone but there i know there are a lot of articles out there about 
to disinfect your phones and different types and if you have a screen protector what do you do so 
would refer people to those but do think about that because your phones are definitely germy sc and what 
when told that allowed to walk outside with our friends on a nice walk to the countryside but as 
as we keep six feet away from them chuckle ts right sc is that good advice ts the recommended 
based on again droplet transmission so how far those droplets would really travel if just talking with another person 
i think especially for those people who really crave those interactions that if you can go outside and do 
hike and keep your distance and things like that again we say anything is riskfree you just know but 
looking for something to do that has minimal risk probably those are the types of activities that you could 
and still be with other people but have less of a risk of transmitting the virus between your groups 
and what about wearing masks while on these walks does that make any sense ts yeah so not really 
the masks that most people will have access to are the paper surgical masks and were helpful if you 
infected and trying to keep your spray from coughs and talking and things like that to yourself so you 
on a mask so that captures a lot of those droplets and keeps it from spreading to other people 
in general those types of things are not helpful we have any evidence that for the average person masks 
help and for the ones that are certified to keep out viral particles the respirators most people use them 
you have to be tested which is a whole thing you have to go through not pleasant ts and 
i mean a lot of the people who are talking about them probably have never worn them for an 
amount of time because uncomfortable the whole point is they filter the air and as you have them on 
hours that makes it hard to breathe so some people who have risk factors like asthma or things like 
not gonna be able to wear them for a very long time anyway just because of that difficulty and 
i think normal people who trained on those you realize how often touching those masks and basically contaminating the 
from the outside so people think about that used them in laboratories but again under conditions where often also 
gloves and so very aware of everything that touching including my face and i know how to take them 
and on correctly without again contaminating yourself with potential virus that may be on the mask so i think 
an average person masks sound good but i think they really do much to help and could potentially even 
you at greater risk if not using them correctly and using them as something to make you maybe feel 
sc yeah ts but then just using them incorrectly i mean a friend of mine go ahead sc i 
gonna say in favor of feeling better but not if it makes things worse off in actuality ts right 
friend of mine shared some pictures she was actually in the airport a couple weeks ago and a woman 
a mask and gloves on and then she took the mask and the gloves off she was in a 
at the airport eating sat them down on her table proceeded to eat and then put them back on 
at which point they had been sitting on the table so they are potentially contaminated and then she put 
just back on and so i think you would see those types of things anyway and she probably just 
her risk rather than just eating going to the bathroom washing her hands and getting on her flight sc 
she increased her risk because she basically allowed contamination to crawl onto her mask and then attached it to 
face right ts exactly exactly and the same thing on her gloves i guarantee she probably thought those gloves 
sterile or something like that not realizing that as soon as you touch anything those gloves are no longer 
so the type of thing that again i think the average person thinks about but those of us who 
trained in microbiology we are hyper aware of that so we know how to use this correctly but most 
sc it was interesting that masks and toilet paper were the first things sold out not quite sure i 
the toilet paper thing but i know that there any available here in southern california right now do you 
is a little bit outside of your area i know but do you have advice for what people should 
sure they have available other than the obvious things is there something missing or something wrongly hoarding ts oh 
i know yeah we have any toilet paper around here either really weird and we went out to get 
some of the basics the other day and milk was almost gone too so those things that we bought 
we keep on hand a lot of dry goods pastas and things like that and canned meat that again 
also be difficult if the deli shuts down or something like that so we try to get things just 
will last for the long haul and even if we even if we eat them right now great then 
have a worth of pasta chuckle sc yeah nothing wrong with that right ts right exactly sc okay so 
of the present day except i guess the one thing that i quite addressed is what happens if you 
infected number one what does the testing regime involve i know that in china and elsewhere they tried and 
think somewhat successfully to implement all sorts of preliminary tests just by taking your temperature remotely just to see 
your temperature goes down if you are infected is that right or does it go up ts i have 
seen that it goes down it should go up you have a fever sc it should go up you 
a fever okay maybe i just got that wrong but then the test is one of the ways of 
here in the us been sort of falling down on right ts right sc but what does it mean 
get tested ts right so what we have available now is a pcr test so that means that looking 
pieces and parts of the virus alright so we take samples typically from at least two maybe three bodily 
so one is a nasopharyngeal swab so a cotton swab that goes up your nose really far back really 
back not pleasant to be honest sc supposed to be quite unpleasant right ts yes yes so take that 
a throat swab like if had a strep test and then for people who are actively coughing up loogies 
take a sputum sample so two or three of those samples and then they will extract the rna from 
samples and run it in a machine and so basically what it will tell you is if you have 
rna present in any of those samples and so if you do then positive obviously if not then negative 
one of the things this is trying to figure out in the optimal time for sampling most people of 
are only gonna get tested if showing symptoms but what if you have people who are exposed to those 
and right now we really doing a lot of that testing but ideally we could test some of those 
and what is the best time to test them so that we have a false negative that they are 
but maybe the virus is at too low of a level to be detected so we call them negative 
then three days later they come back with symptoms so still trying to optimize all of that basically what 
the best places to test and at what time periods sc and i do know that we have nearly 
many tests or other things as we need how quickly can we get that stuff is it something where 
we really put our collective will together then two weeks from now have more than enough tests ts yeah 
theory yes but now starting to see so not only were the tests late in being rolled and the 
are i mean just simple chemical compounds you have they have some what we call primers which are again 
short sequences of nucleic acid that will bind to the viral rna to allow them to be amplified in 
test so some of those some salts and things like that and a mix of just free nucleic acid 
that they can come in and be amplified so not hard to make but some ts running out of 
test kits apparently to do rna extraction so when you get the sample you have to extract the rna 
that running low on on kits for that running low on swabs so the cotton swabs that people need 
do these testings running out of those too so become a place where not now only how can we 
up manufacturing of those test kits but how do we make sure that people have all of these supplies 
they need to do these tests overall and we are just botching it on so many different levels and 
people are trying to figure out so where do we go to get these and i have not seen 
great answer for that some of apparently now that a lot of the colleges are shut down going to 
biology labs and saying if not gonna use those swabs can we have chuckle and such a bad stopgap 
happens then when all those are gone sc yeah ts so i just know it seems like it should 
really simple to ramp all of this up but every time we figure out how to do something it 
like we have another step back somewhere else sc okay this is a sobering thought obviously this is at 
very least an educational incident for planning for the next time around the idea of running out of swabs 
would have occurred to me but clearly kind of important ts yeah there are gonna be so many papers 
on this when all is said and done on all of the things that went wrong sc and can 
right now is as we speak in most countries we are still on the exponential curve a certain time 
takes to double the number of cases between two and three days some countries have turned that over china 
has done quite an effective job japan and south korea and hong kong maybe but heard predictions that something 
half of the population will eventually be infected by this virus is that a reasonable kind of statement or 
that just alarmist to shake us up a little bit ts i think both it all depends on what 
do and the thing why i think those numbers typically are quoted coming from marc lipsitch he was an 
at harvard and has been one of the leading scientists on this and it has a range i think 
last one he released was about of the population and so that depends on what we do and how 
we do it for so one of the big questions right now is okay in this mitigation phase and 
we can slow this down and so then if we slow it down what happens then when we relax 
social distancing when we open restaurants back up is it just gonna peak back again and why watching so 
happening in china and in south korea and to watch when they open things back up again is this 
gonna spike again so those are ts again some of those questions that we just know i think completely 
to think that if we go back to basically just our normal routines that more people are gonna be 
but i know that we can maintain this type of social distancing a report from imperial college and they 
us that this may be necessary for eighteen months or basically until we get a vaccine to do this 
of social distancing i know that gonna work either so all of those predictions on total number of cases 
number of deaths total number of people infected over the course of this pandemic are really dependent on what 
do sc right ts so kind of up to us how low or how high those numbers can be 
what we can take and what society can take and i think we know any of that right now 
yeah no i can absolutely you just said this but gonna say it again so important we do all 
wonderful things we lower the rate of infections substantially and then we relax and it all comes roaring back 
it sort of go away for much longer but also at the same time important to realize that these 
that taking have their own deleterious effects not an easy balance to strike we have to be respectful of 
fact that we need to sort of think carefully about this and not scream at people who disagree with 
about what the appropriate measures are i think ts right right and there is a lot of disagreement even 
the scientific community whether we acted too quickly whether we acted too slowly whether this is gonna help whether 
especially around the aspect of schools so i think there is anything where everyone completely agrees besides the fact 
we need to do something about this but what is the right thing to do sc i know this 
an incredibly unfair question but are there what are the prospects for either cures andor vaccines or is that 
that science is going great guns any minute now or it could be years ts right sc or anywhere 
between ts honestly a little bit chuckle right right a little bit more hopeful about treatments maybe just because 
area i know less about so i can be more optimistic sc exactly do it ts but it looks 
chuckle right there are some drugs out there that may be helping some drugs that have been used for 
previously or that were developed for ebola that are being used to treat this for coronavirus they are in 
trials a malaria drug that has been used for this that is in clinical trials so the nice thing 
those is that we already have information about those we already know a little bit about their safety about 
effects and things like that so those are able to move much more quickly when it comes to vaccines 
are at square one basically there were some vaccines that had been started for sars but then sars we 
able to contain it and it went away and so no one cares anymore and the funding went away 
the expertise in some cases went away ts so we have some of those that were developed that hoping 
get back into clinical trials we have a new one that developing that clinical trials are already underway in 
state but even those for vaccines we have to do several different phases so right now the one that 
taking place in washington it is solely a study for safety you have to have a safe vaccine first 
injecting it into people to look for those types of side effects and you just do this in a 
some of these things that a vaccine may cause potentially could be delayed for months if you have an 
reaction or something like that so be looking at that first for safety and then the test if it 
works to protect people from the infection sc right ts and then even now we again follow those for 
very long period of time so vaccines just are not easy and not quick and we want them to 
quick because we want people to be injured from them or have things happen that we see in those 
trials so of course seen the predictions for twelve to eighteen months for vaccine and i just i think 
are the most optimistic projections sc the most optimistic okay good ts yeah and i just know that gonna 
those targets or not sc so a little bit of room for optimism about treatment not so much about 
and just to be clear i take it that if treatment that is what we have for the next 
years then still have to do everything we can to slow and limit the rate of transmission ts right 
still we still have another way besides social distancing and hand washing and all of the things doing now 
prevent infections so treatment obviously is for those who are already potentially in the icu or very ill otherwise 
something so that they would get the drugs but of course after already experienced this severe infection sc so 
to focus the mind a little bit right now wednesday march seen people in all goodhearted sincerity think that 
weeks from now be getting back to but i see any reason for that i would i would guess 
everything going through right now up to including the sort of shelter in place in the worst places and 
shut down of restaurants and things here in la or in ohio at least two months right ts yeah 
one of the lead scientists on this for the white house has been tony fauci who is the director 
the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases and he has suggested at least eight weeks so i think 
need to get into that mindset that yeah this is not gonna be over in two weeks not gonna 
able to pick up and go to your concerts that are in early april or something just not gonna 
on the radar at that point sc and what is what does the end game look like if we 
a vaccine at what point would you again putting a lot of responsibility on you feel bad about that 
what point could we relax a little bit or is there a threshold a test or some criterium by 
we can say things are getting ts right and one of the things the imperial college report looked at 
is trying to figure out what level of disease in the population can you relax things a little bit 
then do you have to be prepared to okay once it gets above that threshold again then you go 
these things all over so basically kind of cycling through this and there are no great answers to that 
we also have still the unanswered question of warmer weather help with and i think a lot of good 
that it will but i noticed that people are definitely at least clinging to that bit of hope that 
it warms up across the country that maybe transmission will decrease due to higher temperatures and things like that 
i know i know if summer will help us or not if we could relax some of those if 
saw transmission decrease and viral survival outside of the body decrease because of the heat and humidity in the 
i just know and the problem with some of those thresholds too is that that assumes doing a lot 
testing so you really know how it is circulating in the population and of course we still have that 
so all of those really require some things that again either not doing or we have in place or 
about as far as some of the effects it may have on the virus in coming weeks sc so 
i might ts so yeah we just know yet sc yeah it might be the case that then things 
more or less like they are now or even more shut down for the next two months and then 
undergo some sort of cycle of relaxing a little bit and then tightening back up if and when things 
worse again and that could last for a while ts right we and i have not seen any of 
us either scientific or political leaders respond to that yet so i know what their thoughts are as far 
doing that type of cycling i just know sc and so okay so i guess the final big picture 
have said that the virulence of this particular pandemic is kind of a onceinacentury thing does that mean probably 
be okay against things like this for a while just probabilistically or are we entering a new phase when 
like this happen all the time ts yeah snd i know i was in iowa for a long time 
we had several floods within a fiveyear period chuckle so statistically you have that but yeah we did right 
well because the underlying conditions were changing ts right exactly exactly based those were all based on calculations from 
ago and now switched and so the same thing here i think we were lucky with sars we were 
that i think that have that transmission during the incubation period or at least very little of it and 
we were able to put that genie back in the bottle been able to contain mers this one got 
of hand and we just really know how many of those other types of coronaviruses or other viruses that 
on our radar could be lurking in animals around the globe and could have the potential to do this 
the human population so i think we should get comfortable i think we need to think of this not 
a onceinacentury event but what if once in a decade event we just know but we need to have 
of those preparations in place so that we can be more nimble to respond to these types of things 
they happen and not be completely behind the curve as we have been with every step for this one 
well i think that doing our part here in this episode to make people not comfortable chuckle and not 
ts chuckle perfect fantastic sc i know but look life does continue on i think that resilient we will 
ways to live under whatever conditions we have and it might we might suffer a little bit but we 
continue on doing things like the work doing and even go so far as to say conversations like this 
very helpful to get people informed so thanks so much for being on the podcast at very short notice

from someone who knows the literature about the masks i thought it was a bit misleading to say that 
is not useful for combating the spread of the virus if masks prevent infected people from spreading the virus 
if a lot of infections are asymptomatic or as you put it nicely then surely wearing a mask will 
the overall transmission rate significantly one sidenote is that i feel when we talk about combating the spread of 
virus we should distinguish between egocentric measures ie measures which will protect from infections and social measures ie measures 
might not protect specifically but would help reduce the overall rate of transmission in a society we can then 
that masks are ineffective from an egocentric perspective but effective from a social perspective if any of the above 
wrong then i would love to learn how and why thanks again for the great work comments are closed
