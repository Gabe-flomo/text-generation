and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today talking about political polarization where it comes 
and why it seems to be more now than it was in the past always someone who is a 
bit skeptical when people point to the present day and some feature of it whether economic or political or 
and say very different now than it ever used to be very difficult to say objectively right because we 
experience the world differently when twenty years old fifty years old eighty years old and we change no doubt 
it seems to us that the world is changing in different ways but hard to be objective about it 
i do kind of buy the idea that political polarization has increased in the sense that sort of been 
sorting of people at the very least in the us but i think a broader phenomenon than that into 
set of alignments on different issues that you might not think are necessarily connected and nevertheless people are sorting 
into tribes sc and this is not a correct or incorrect thing i mean maybe this is a good 
i know but it seems to be there and we wanna ask why did that happen in a way 
there seemed to be more of a continuum in the so today talking to ezra klein a name that 
of you sure know ezra has a famous podcast of his own ezra and i sort of heard of 
other got to know each other a very tiny bit way back in the early days of blogging i 
my blog in preposterous universe ezra was writing at wonkblog and pandagon back in the day now of course 
cofounder and i know exactly what his title is head editor of voxcom which has become a little bit 
i guess because people like controversy sc happy to say that i love voxcom i always agree with what 
but i love the philosophy of explainers right of giving you the background for why things are true so 
dealing with politics is going to engender controversy but okay we got to do it a believer that understanding 
political world is very important so this podcast is not about saying right wrong but trying to understand the 
that have increased polarization in the modern world is there something we can do about it should there be 
we can do about it is it inevitable is technology causing it or is it something that is a 
bit more contingent and perhaps reversible remember you can support the podcast by becoming a patreon supporter on patreoncomseanmcarroll 
you have to support on patreon i mind one way or the other but a nice thing to do 
also it gets you ad free versions of the podcast plus every month i try to answer a bunch 
questions in an me that can be a lot of fun people ask really good questions and become a 
tradition so patreoncomseanmcarroll and with that go music sc ezra klein welcome to the mindscape podcast ezra klein thrilled 
be here the dumbest guest ever had laughter sc well well you know no such thing as a dumb 
ek the most math illiterate sc if i recall correctly a blogger at pandagon is that correct is that 
yes that is right i am jesse understudy sc we all start somewhere did you ever have a vision 
what blogging was going to become like back in the days did you think today some sort either been 
by the media or it is the media not quite sure which way to say it ek yeah and 
now because a lot of original bloggers run media organizations and user platforms to be nostalgic about how they 
to bring blogging back and how it all got killed but no i will sometimes an analysis we can 
on my career that been making these very strategic moves from the very beginning to get into media and 
forget how absurd the idea was originally that blogging would ever get you any kind of job it was 
just the word no other thing that has the sound sc disqualifying phonetically really yeah ek like right yeah 
disqualifying i like that but also it initially was hated by journalists it it rose up as part of 
critique of how the media did its work so the idea when i was a freshman in college starting 
blog that that would somehow ever lead to journalism i would have laughed at you and so actually one 
these things where a lot of other people saw earlier than i did that i might end up in 
because even well into my blogging career those two worlds just seemed so different from each other that the 
of bridging them seemed a bit absurd sc they were back in the day but i do have nostalgia 
for those days my wife jennifer and i met because we read each blogs ek no kidding sc good 
can happen ek oh my god the most beautiful blog story of them all sc pretty good and our 
was announced in nature the scientific journal laughter sc but now all grown up and writing books some steps 
between but skip those but you have a book out called why polarized is did i get the title 
ek i do yes sc the first question i have to ask as a fellow book author is how 
discussion went in with you and your publisher about versus we are chuckle contraction in there ek zero zero 
zero they just went for it you just suggested that ek zero they did they would not have dared 
suggest we are to me sc alright they know you too much ek we went through a bunch a 
believer that the only words that matter in anything are the headline so at vox i have a rule 
if you write a piece which is what we do or a video or a podcast any of it 
have to come up with ten headline options because people will spend all this time on the underlying piece 
journalism and then by the end of it exhausted of whatever been writing about podcasting about making a video 
and so you just like throw on a headline and so if the headline is bad it often matter 
the underlying piece is good so for this book i think we i think i tried to get us 
thirty possible headlines and this came in later and then i think i expected that this one would stick 
it really was what the book was about and the other which you have not mentioned but is my 
greatest accomplishment on the book is there was no subtitle sc there was no subtitle i was gonna mention 
very very impressive gonna try that ek yes people should buy this book people should buy this book if 
no other reason than to push the publishing industry away from subtitles sc radical i just sent a new 
proposal in without a subtitle my agent was like the chuckle but i love that you even call it 
title you call it a headline laughter ek a headline a headline sc you might be new at writing 
but at headlines this is your thing that they should ek i am very new at writing books chuckle 
they should just listen to you ek a babe in the woods here sc but did you enjoy it 
know not getting on the substance yet but we will get there did you have fun are you a 
writer ek no this is actually the conversation i wanna have exhausted the book substance sc yeah alright laughter 
did i enjoy it so i signed on to do a book with simon schuster sixish years ago when 
was still at the washington post and it was a very different book that i had sold them and 
was much more about the policymaking process and institutions and forces in political life and politics that ended up 
policy even though they get a lot of attention so things like the congressional budget office the filibuster polarization 
in there but it was not the primary thing ek and i had to put that down myself and 
bell and matt yglesias decided to start vox and so i put that book down and think about it 
years and then about two years ago when i stepped down as editorinchief of vox one thing that i 
felt when i was editorinchief was that i did i able to do the reporting that been doing in 
years prior and so in some ways i was running off the fumes of an old understanding of politics 
i was looking around and we are well into the trump era now and just realizing that i have 
model that really explained how we got from obama to trump why things looked and felt the way they 
why politics was working the way it was ek my background is in policy reporting and so i have 
lot of models for what happens when congress starts working on a bill and why it always collapses into 
omnishambles but i have a model about why politics had seemingly gone off the rails in the way it 
and so this book was an opportunity for me to try to rebuild my understanding of politics from the 
up in a way that that could help explain what was happening for me and then hopefully for an 
and so in that way it was an incredibly difficult and incredibly rewarding intellectual process and a humbling one 
realize oftentimes and done this more than i have on much harder topics than taking on but you realize 
there are things that are operating in your implicit model of the world that when you force them down 
the page it turns out that thin sc yeah ek or possibly not even there one of the big 
of this to me was i have a chapter the penultimate chapter in the book but one of the 
really proud of on asymmetric polarization this idea that the right has gone further right and we should talk 
what that means and the left has gone left i actually think and are the quite right words there 
the right has become a it has responded to polarization by straying further from the norms of american politics 
the left has across a variety of different dimensions and this is a wellknown thing in political science norm 
and tom mann have written a book about it quite well known called even worse than it jacob hacker 
paul pearson have written on this so have others ek what was striking to me when i began really 
at that literature i believed and could look around you can see asymmetric polarization playing out all around us 
thought that there was a good causal story and there just that there were stories about mitch mcconnell and 
doing things but why those people were the ones who were being rewarded why they were emerging on the 
and not the left why had republicans forced out two speakers in a couple of years whereas democrats in 
house are still led by the exact same leadership team they had in there was something different happening in 
parties and while there had been narrativizations of it there actually was not a good causal story for it 
so having to actually force onto the page the model do the reporting to fill in the gaps and 
realize where the stories that i had been told or that i had seen had holes that i needed 
fill was really quite helpful sc i mean as you say in the book that in some ways the 
of trump was a unique event but in so many other ways it was just business as usual in 
sense so these underlying structural questions are really fascinating like a future historian would not look at the numbers 
who voted for whom and why and say that this was anything out of the ordinary ek absolutely and 
is something really trying to do in the book is to show that what is striking about trump is 
how different and aberrant the two thousand sixteen election was but in fact how normal it was how much 
just simply put back together the mitt romney coalition with a couple of tweaks on the sidelines sc right 
and i do this i show it through exit polls going back a couple of elections how you really 
able to pick this one out of a lineup but the thing this hits to a big story in 
life which is that the two parties have polarized and let me try to say this very clearly polarization 
a word that i think has been thrown on very incoherently because it can mean a lot of different 
but what has happened is the two parties have sorted themselves by ideology race religiosity geography culture and psychology 
the past fifty or sixty years such that what republican and democrat means how much information those labels encode 
much much larger than it was then sc right so defining what is meant by polarization right ek exactly 
because i think a lot of people would just sort of casually conflate it with disagreement which has been 
for a long time ek yes sc but this is a very different phenomenon ek i wanna note a 
important point you just made there because something that is misleading when you look back at american history is 
will sometimes tell a story about disagreement as a way of disproving the idea of polarization they will say 
burr shot alexander hamilton they later made a musical about sc yeah ek a wellknown fact in american life 
you can go even back to the which importantly are a nadir of polarization in america one of the 
in which our political system is least polarized but look around you have political assassinations you have student protesters 
killed in the streets you have the civil rights movement the feminism movement the indigenous rights movement we are 
the antiwar movement at a moment there where the ferocity of disagreement is such that you have actual violence 
the streets urban riots and so on and yet the political system itself is not that polarized so a 
to look back and say had republican and democratic parties going back to the civil war had disagreement that 
other times was violent much more so than it is now so come on this be that laughter ek 
in many ways by the way very true this is not comparatively that bad what is different is that 
disagreements are so well sorted by party and that is having very distinct effects both on the nature of 
our disagreements play out what the political system is able to do in their midst and where things are 
we can talk about this more later but i think a very scary thought experiment is to imagine the 
of genuine civic division of the and paste it on to the political structure of what now the you 
that one out for a little bit and you end up in a happy place chuckle sc to me 
know this is just predictable but it sounds like a physics problem to me you have a bunch ek 
when a physicist i guess it all does sc what happens right ek but is it a classical or 
quantum physics problem sc just purely classical no you need quantum mechanics no spooky action at a distance or 
like that but i think that the physics of politics of political science is fascinating to me and basically 
have a collective phenomenon with many little constituents and you might say entropy increases and all just mix but 
fact sorting as you say in the book as you make the case very strongly so that different characteristics 
these little constituents begin to become correlated in interesting ways so clearly not just random particles moving interacting being 
by things by external forces and figuring out what those forces are is very important ek yeah so something 
you see in the book is that what trying to do is offer a description and a framework of 
a system is working and something that i do explicitly and repeatedly is make the argument that individuals have 
narrower ranges of action than we like to think as you say very much a classical not a quantum 
we very much can predict where people are gonna end up pretty well and important because i think that 
way in which my own industry political journalism i wanna say misleads people but ends up confusing the situation 
that we narrativize the story of american politics through the stories of individual politicians most saliently the president but 
much particularly in elections years the opposing candidate or candidates to some degree the leaders of the house and 
and then always a couple of other players operating with less formally huge bases of power but an alexandria 
a ted cruz these people become political superstars and as we tell these if you read a book of 
narration like game change or one of these you really see it chuckle ek was this meeting at the 
house and the person said the thing and the other person walked out and then they told us and 
everything has in the way of human interactions this feeling of indeterminacy well what if they just said the 
thing what if they just made that messaging mistake what if they just elected the other person and the 
making in this is that the system is driving outcomes and shaping incentives such that while obviously there is 
range of free will operating within american politics at least depending on your broader metaphysical view of humanity some 
of what we think of as free will operating in american politics pretty narrow and people are much more 
the point the incentives and systems around them and polarization is in some ways the master story and master 
system of them all are shaping the way they understand the information that helps them make decisions shaping who 
trust who they listen to who they fear who trying to attract and so you can really predict pretty 
what people are gonna do even when you have tremendously large variation in the individuals at play ek and 
is why the story of presidency is very telling what we basically did is we chuckle it was not 
simulation unfortunately living through it but we ran a version of american politics where we tested the theory we 
the republican party an incredibly aberrant individual aberrant in his ideology aberrant in his relationship with the republican party 
relationship to republican party elites aberrant in how he acted personally the kinds of things he said the way 
communicated the way he attacked say what you will about donald trump people who love him will say a 
unusual figure people who hate him will say a very unusual figure and you put this very unusual figure 
and what happens you reconstruct most of mitt coalition and then the republican party falls in line behind the 
leader and he ends up more or less governing as a traditional republican with a very unusual twitter account 
if that is not a test of how much polarization in the broader political system incentives contain even the 
disruptive figure i know what is sc yeah no i think an excellent thing i think that as a 
looking for the underlying systematic things going on is much more educational i know if much more important or 
but certainly much more illuminating to me than telling a story of lyndon johnson in the backroom twisting arm 
ek well let me ask this of you read it and did the book did the system feel convincing 
you does the analysis of the did the pieces fit together in a way that you looked at it 
thought that explains what or does it feel like the pieces quite fit sc yeah always hard to tell 
speaking the answer is yes i think it is a pretty convincing story overall this quasihistorical analysis because the 
states has a history that is very unique with the civil war and slavery and reconstruction in the south 
the whole bit i do worry if being really really rigorous that we can tell ourselves a story that 
us a warm and fuzzy feeling about things without really knowing how to test it rigorously but up to 
ek did you find this one very warm and fuzzy though chuckle sc well okay warm and fuzzy in 
sense of i understand going not that i like it chuckle sc so share with the audience who has 
read the book we said actually sorry maybe this went by too quickly or was embedded in too many 
the thing about polarization is that everyone has characteristics where they live how old they are religious beliefs political 
economic beliefs but in principle those could be independently distributed you could have economic rightwing people with socially leftwing 
etcetera and the polarization is this kind of sorting where different attitudes become aligned in a very significant way 
that a fair short summary ek yeah let me even back it up one more step a problem with 
is people do not tend to say the next word in the sentence or the description polarization of what 
so if you begin to look into and this book as you mentioned it has some amount of historical 
in it but very heavily inflected by political science and to some degree social psychology and then political reporting 
is my bread and butter but so when you study polarization there are a couple things you could be 
and they have to be happening at the same time and in fact some could be getting worse and 
getting better but you can have polarization of policy so the two parties have clustered around almost perfectly opposite 
one wants to tax people more the other wants to end taxes entirely i use the example i think 
some point in the book of cannabis policy you can have a party one party is for full legalization 
marijuana and the other party is for full criminalization of it that would be perfectly polarized on the policy 
then you could have a situation where polarized by what they call affective polarization affective polarization and what they 
by that is polarization in how you feel about your party and the other parties so even if your 
are not that divergent seeing an increase in how much people hate the other party one thing worth noting 
seeing a lot more affective polarization than policy polarization the two interact in important ways but one what has 
really risen up is how negatively people feel about the other party more than how much they necessarily disagree 
the other party so i wanna note that then a question of you looking at elite or mass a 
between country is either in how it feels about the other side or its own side or what it 
about policy and just elites doing it and a lot of disagreement about this but i think a little 
of a disagreement without a difference but the evidence is extremely strong on elite polarization and that seems to 
be sorting the structure that the rest of the country has to respond to sc so the elites are 
the polarization charge ek the elites seem to be leading the charge one of the arguments that is central 
the book is that the most important form of polarization and one of the most important questions in american 
just in general is identity polarization identity politics is a term people have heard a lot people use it 
lot right now but i am trying to offer what i think of as a much more rigorous definition 
that and so in the way we typically use it in american politics refers to traditionally marginalized or weaker 
who are making a claim for something of importance to their group africanamericans making a claim about police brutality 
jewish people making a claim about antisemitism these would traditionally be understood as identity politics whereas rural gun owners 
want the second amendment expansively interpreted just politics or ceos who want their taxes cut just politics but identity 
an incredibly powerful way that people operate in the world ek i am californian and a father and jewish 
a vegan and so on and so forth and one of the things that is happening is that our 
are stacking and connecting to our political identities and this is what you were talking about in the set 
to this question which is what we used to have were very crosscutting identities that played across parties if 
go back to say the and you look at a range of demographic characteristics there more than ten percentage 
difference in how prevalent those groups were in either party even ideology was not wellstructured between the parties you 
a lot of liberal republicans you had a lot of conservative democrats when strom thurmond was a democratic member 
the senate he was the second most conservative senator according to different rankings we had at that time so 
lot of this was happening as you alluded to because of race the dixiecrats which were the southern wing 
the democratic party they were quite conservative but importantly very racially conservative they functionally ran the south as a 
system built on protecting a racial hierarchy system but they were very powerful in the democratic party and so 
they created was almost a blockade around the two parties coalescing around ideologies ek part of why you had 
lot of liberal republicans because liberal republicans did not agree with what was happening in the democratic party on 
as the civil rights act and other things that happened begin to end that blockage and so you have 
move into the republican party including in the south which is now the most conservative region of the country 
have liberals move into the democratic party and that for a variety of reasons kicks off this period of 
and so now you back if you go into the early century the density of a place does not 
its partisan politics but now there is no place in america more dense than nine hundred people per square 
if remembering the stat right that is republican so if you get denser you will always see a democrat 
all major cities in america are democratic religiosity has become very different the republic overwhelmingly christian it used to 
that they were both this way now the single largest religious group in the democratic party is people who 
religiously unaffiliated the democratic party is a coalition of a lot of different religious groups liberal christians buddhists atheists 
ek on race the democratic party is i believe it is nonwhite at least in its two thousand sixteen 
vote or in its two thousand sixteen vote the republican party is over white and i can keep going 
this psychologically sorted this whole openness to experience stuff there are different ways people play this out sc we 
a great conversation with will wilkinson on the podcast about the urbanrural divide but also the personality factors and 
they come in and i wanna get back to that but keep going ek yeah so anyway the point 
that on almost everything you can think of the parties have over the past fifty years sorted so that 
identities are stacking on top of each other as opposed to crossing so you have a ton of union 
who are republicans you have a ton of rural southerners who are democrats and so as that happens and 
lot of evidence on this from outside of politics too when you begin to stack identities the nature of 
becomes much deeper it becomes much more threatening and more affective polarization hatred and fear of the other side 
or identification with your own side is a quite rational response if polarization was not as high in the 
part because well if you were a kind of moderate democrat looking at the republican party you saw a 
of people like yourself in it richard nixon domestically at least did a lot of quite moderate and even 
looking back liberal things and conversely bill clinton did some quite conservative things ek and now you look at 
other side and much more different from you demographically much more different than you ideologically and so the threat 
pose to you and to your view of the good life is much more severe and so the kind 
central form of polarization now this stacked identity polarization that is feeding into the majoritarian political identities not just 
groups sc yeah so i think that the evidence i always worry when we compare our era to previous 
because we are at different ages and we live in different eras right and so we always tend to 
things through different kinds of glasses but it seems that quantitative evidence that the polarization really has increased mentioned 
lot of it already but one thing that i found fascinating that really drove it home was the undecided 
disappearing why you say something about that ek so we just used to have a lot let me put 
actually think that the simplest way to put this is looking at ticket splitting and i have all these 
right in front of me right now but basically ticket splitting was very very very common thirty or forty 
ago so you might vote for a democrat for president and then a republican for your member of congress 
south was full of ticket splitting particularly in the post civil rights act era so they begin voting routinely 
republicans for president not every state in the south but it happens a lot but nevertheless until that generation 
out the south had an enmity towards the republican party due to the republican party invading and occupying it 
the civil war so the affiliation is to democrats and to the southern dixiecrats and so they continue to 
have a hammerlock on the south for quite some time even as at the national level the south begins 
trend towards the republican party so there was a lot of ticket splitting i think the numbers i have 
the book are that the correlation in your vote between house and presidential in terms of partisan lean is 
like during these periods in i believe it was so the correlation goes from being real but not necessarily 
to basically everything sc yeah ek undecided voters true undecided voters and worth saying an interesting facet of all 
is that this high rise in polarization is happening at a time when we have more and more independent 
independents but it turns out that most independents are just partisans in disguise i have a lot of evidence 
this in the book but is a good personal brand if you give people pictures of folks and you 
them to rate how attractive they are but you also say if republicans democrats or independents people will rate 
less attractive people more attractive if told independents independent is a great political brand but the number of sc 
think we need more romantic advice here on the mindscape podcast so i like that so for your personal 
audience independents not democrats or republicans ek my job is politics my passion is offering people relationship advice so 
time you want to do that here for it sc excellent chuckle ek that said you used to have 
pretty fair number of what they called voters who one election to another would change who voting for and 
stat i love and this comes from the political scientist alan abramowitz and again i should have a book 
front of me right now but i but in i think it is the the swing in how a 
votes at the presidential level from election to election is i believe it is eight or nine percentage points 
if you know how the state voted for president one year in the next election you can expect a 
significant swing in where going ek now under two percentage points so states have become much more fixed in 
place no question about california gonna vote for the democrat in just as no question about whether or not 
virginia will vote for the republican so across basically every form of data we can look at people are 
much more stable in their political preferences and something that i cannot emphasize enough is this makes sense this 
a rational response to what has happened which is that the two parties have become much more different another 
of evidence i love this comes from corman schmidt a political scientist is that today people who are selfstyled 
voters or lowinformation voters they are as certain when polled about the differences between the two parties or the 
candidates as people who are strong partisans or highinformation voters were in the sc so if you told a 
in the like i am a diehard and they said to you how sure how confident are you that 
can name the differences between how richard nixon and i know mcgovern would say you at this point being 
who really like politics or feel attached to either parties you are stronger on that question not because the 
back then were lying because now the differences are much much much bigger and so rationally it is easier 
i make the way i put it in the book is that it is harder to tell a donkey 
from a mule than to tell a donkey apart from an elephant sc absolutely and i think that also 
positive feedback loop which is a point you make in the book because it used to be that of 
voters were really persuadable i vote for the republican or the and now i think the number was less 
which means that if you wanna win an election spend all your time trying to convince those people try 
spend the have your rabid partisans get out the vote actually show up and therefore you go you preach 
your converted ek yeah so the second half of the book is about the feedback loops that have been 
off in american politics by polarization and i talk particularly about the media about how elections are run about 
presidency and about governance in the presidency and congress and then about the two political parties as institutions and 
saying there is true so it used to be that what trying to do in elections was vie for 
persuadable people in the middle and these are usually people with a lot of crosscutting identities reasonably weak policy 
and what they wanted was somebody who they could see themselves in and so you have the two political 
running candidates pretty often who fuzz the difference a bit ek think of bill clinton as a new democrat 
makes a big show of the ways in which conservative his identities are southern a white man he says 
end welfare as we know it a democrat but a democratic a conservative might look at and or certainly 
independent might look at and think can kinda get behind that george w bush runs as a compassionate conservative 
makes a point of saying gonna really focus on the racial education gap and he makes a point of 
that we balance our budgets on the backs of the poor and so a very long period in american 
when the strategy used to win an election is to try to choose a candidate and then choose a 
of issues that are gonna be good for a voter who is persuadable to you but quite agree and 
naturally pulls you towards the middle ek now as the number of persuadable voters has gone down what you 
are candidates who are running base mobilization strategies donald a pure base mobilization candidate barack obama rhetorically would make 
feints towards the middle but as a symbolic candidate an africanamerican from an urban area who is a constitutional 
professor at the u of chicago very much a candidate for democratic mobilization and it looks like where democrats 
go you know certainly it looks like the democratic party is moving in a basemobilization direction as republicans have 
the big inflection point here seems to be the two thousand four election under george w bush but very 
about this is that not a oneway system so as the candidacies as the political parties begin running more 
mobilization strategies what they do is they further polarize the electorate so if you are dealing with a choice 
say bernie sanders and donald trump much easier for you as a member of the electorate to decide which 
of that on than when you were looking at a choice between george h w bush and bill clinton 
as the democratic party moves to the left and moves sort of in a democratic socialist direction and moves 
a bit to the left on immigration and race which are very powerful political issues and the republican party 
right on them that polarizes the public too people follow their parties they take cues they develop their opinions 
their parties and then when people look around this huge gap between them and so in deciding between the 
of them you sort of move in one direction or another harder to be locked in that kind of 
middle sc and if gonna if gonna boil down the explanation to a sentence so why polarized is it 
dixiecrat explanation is that the single most important thing that a compelling historical story but it seems unique to 
united states it seems like something that would not explain things elsewhere but maybe i should be asking as 
question are other countries polarized in the same line ek other countries are very highly polarized sc yeah ek 
dixiecrat thing is not i would say the explanation for polarization at all sc okay ek what the dixiecrat 
is is the explanation for it is the primary explanation for why did america have a period of depolarized 
in the middle of the century sc okay ek so number one for most of american history or at 
much of it america was quite polarized if you go back to say before the civil war that was 
very polarized country that ended up having political parties where one wanted to invade part of the other so 
have had polarization here before and we have it very sharply in other countries i mean look at the 
a very big difference between the labour party of jeremy corbyn and the tory party of boris johnson i 
johnson has moderated a bit on things like the national health service but still quite a bit of polarization 
in general political parties tended towards polarization for all kinds of obvious reasons if you are trying to be 
product on a political market so to speak you need to differentiate from the other products ek race is 
reason and basically in the century america was a fourparty system it was democrats dixiecrats liberal republicans and conservative 
and then it collapsed down into a twoparty system as the dixiecrat blockage undid itself but that is why 
actually the incentives of political systems and i would also say at this point social media systems and others 
mean we can talk about other things in the polarization stack but i think a very very important point 
say that century america is both for us and globally that is the aberration sc yeah okay no i 
ek when you have high salience high information high salience political systems with multiple political parties polarization is usually 
result what is distinct about america and we can talk about this is that most political systems function just 
amid polarization whoever has a majority is able to govern political system which was designed to resist political parties 
distinct in that it does not function well amidst polarization you need pretty high levels of consensus in the 
political system to do anything at all and so one particular threat polarization plays to us compared poses to 
compared to other countries is basically making ambitious governance in this country impossible over the long term sc yeah 
is gonna be a problem but i like that way of putting it that became clear even though i 
your book when you just said it that the dixiecrat phenomenon is more about explaining why we polarized ek 
sc and maybe arguably polarization is a more natural thing but okay if the case let me bring up 
counter expectation maybe if polarization is a way of characterizing the fact that along multiple different dimensions beliefs or 
are why why should they be why should my religion or race be correlated with my feelings about the 
tax do you think that really is a natural thing or is this again something because in a society 
sort of sorts us by identity in different ways ek i think it is a logical thing but i 
it is a natural thing and it is in this way we have a often quite naive view of 
people form their politics which is to say there is this classical view that what people are doing is 
up blinking their eyes wiping the sleep out of them and looking around and saying i do i feel 
the estate tax how do i feel about capital gains taxes do i think china is a currency manipulator 
it a good idea to assassinate soleimani will that do more to stabilize or destabilize the middle east should 
have a singlepayer healthcare system or would it be better to have a multipayer system or just a universal 
soon as you begin running through the number of decisions that american politics asks us in theory to make 
maybe the clear way to put that is the number of questions american politics asks us to have preferences 
it becomes quickly ridiculous we have a carbon tax or should we just fund rd into new energy ek 
including people who do this professionally can have an informed opinion a truly informed opinion on that many things 
parties are these crucial mediators of american politics and so what functionally happens the way most people operationalize our 
is they attach to a party whether or not they admit doing this or not to say a word 
the independents and then they let they trust that party more or less to either make decisions for them 
and this is very important too is sometimes they really trust the party they vote for but they really 
fear the other party there are a lot of people who are republicans not loving donald trump but they 
the democrats a lot of democrats who love the democrats but they really do not wanna see donald trump 
ek and so then the question is why do we attach to political parties in this way and where 
becomes really important and so what basically seeing the way the causal chain actually goes is that the political 
are connected to certain identities for a bunch of different reasons you brought up the example of race here 
parties traditional cleavages on race going to the postcivil rights act era where in the subsequent election barry goldwater 
against the civil rights sorry not the subsequent election the election barry goldwater runs against the civil rights act 
then lyndon johnson is for it that is a key moment in american politics so what is happening there 
i wanna note this for a minute because it shows you how different the depolarized and the polarized periods 
ek republicans supported the civil rights act in congress in very large numbers so actually as a proportion of 
of congress of their own party republicans voted for the civil rights act both in the house and senate 
a higher proportion than democrats did but then in the election barry goldwater runs against the civil rights act 
lyndon johnson is for it and so as opposed to this being a bipartisan accomplishment it quickly becomes a 
between the parties when it could have been the reverse you very much could imagine a republican party that 
become the party of civil rights as it had been traditionally it was abraham party and the democratic party 
the dixiecrats who went the other way but this does begin to kick off this period where the republican 
home for the white identity politics backlash to the civil rights movement ek and so the democratic party becomes 
party of nonwhite americans a party that has a investment in and a policy agenda built for a more 
and diversifying country and so people who are not white tend to grow up in houses that are democratic 
they are attached democratic party through that identity a lot of people who are white are having the opposite 
particularly in the south with the republican party and then having done that they take their views on the 
tax from the party or more often than not they think about the estate tax at all because very 
a central issue in american politics so identity attaches you to party and then party helps filter for you 
you believe and who you believe about what will be better for the country but the idea that what 
happening is that people are maybe listeners of mindscape are but most people do not sit down look at 
fifty policy items they think are gonna come before congress this year and reason backwards from them they reason 
from who they already trust sc yeah i think that nobody does i think that ed witten or stephen 
does that we have these finite cognitive capacities if you read thinking fast and slow we reason by heuristics 
the psychology of it is fascinating to me and you tell the story in the book which is heard 
before but i can never hear it enough times about how politics makes you stupider even when it just 
to doing math problems why you share that one with the audience ek yeah so and i would twist 
it one way which is even more than that it makes smart people very stupid sc right a bigger 
for the ek it makes you dumber the smarter you are laughter ek so the math problem story is 
are a group of researchers led by dan kahan at yale law school done this great work on political 
and partisan motivated reasoning or as he puts it which i like even better what he calls identity protective 
so there are times when just reasoning to the truth but times when what doing is reasoning to protect 
identity and our standing in the group and so one of the experiments he did which is very clever 
they gave people this basically a brain teaser a math problem built so that if you look at it 
gonna get it wrong and in one version of the math problem about how well a skin care cream 
and when you give people that math problem you get exactly what you would expect which is people who 
better at math sean carroll get the math problem right my dad is a mathematician sure get the math 
right and people who are not as good at math get it wrong but then they had a variant 
the study which is they gave you the exact same problem same proportions the same tendency towards fooling people 
now about how well a gun control policy worked from one party or the other ek and all of 
sudden when you do that particularly for people who are better at math math stops being helpful in giving 
the right answer whether or not you get the right answer is whether or not you believe in gun 
and so even people i love this finding for math the disparity is biggest among the people who are 
at math sc yeah chuckle ek and this ladders out and i have a lot of evidence around this 
the book but it ladders out to all kinds of different things the smarter you are and even a 
direct way of putting it the more high information you are as a voter what it tends to do 
give you a lot of cognitive resources to convince yourself of why what your group believes or what you 
believe is already correct sc whatever that thing is ek whatever that is if ever tried to argue with 
climate change denier something you will find is that they are often quite informed about some aspects of science 
is a terrific performance of scientific inquiry and by the way they would listen to me right now and 
chuckle climate change believers are doing this performance of scientific or if talked to somebody a truther they know 
lot about melting points of steel the issue here is not that people have the wrong views because dumb 
the reason they have very wrong views is because quite smart and that has given them an incentive to 
out and search for the wrong views or answers or information that will back them up in the wrong 
some good work from larry bartels and christopher achen in the book they have this wonderful paper called feels 
chuckle ek and the point of it is that when they ask people the budget deficit get bigger or 
under bill an actual answer to that question but the more informed republicans are likelier to answer it wrong 
less informed republicans and going backwards more partisan democrats were less likely to know that inflation had fallen under 
reagan and because if you have ever read the national review or the new republic or whatever it might 
if you are going around in the bill clinton era and like a not very informed republican you probably 
you like bill clinton but you know that much about the economy and probably heard the deficit came down 
so fine i like bill clinton deficit has come down ek if a reader of the national review and 
that period hearing a lot about the size of the trade deficit with china and a credit bubble and 
on and a lot of ways to arrange the facts that you think no the in general getting worse 
deficit is fake there are these huge unfunded liabilities in social and so you answer that a different way 
we mediate not just the information we believe and not just whom we trust which is crucial but the 
actually looking for by what our side is and so the people who are very smart and very committed 
politics they are better than other people are at finding the information to tell them that what they already 
is right sc yeah no i think this i think in the very first little solo thing i did 
announce the existence of this podcast i talked about how i wanted a common theme to be what we 
attention to when it comes to deciding right and wrong reasoning capacities which math is standing in for here 
also the evidence that we look for but am i recalling correctly it was a couple weeks ago but 
your book you mentioned that the probability or the fact that if you do try to listen to alternate 
to people who you believe that can often backfire ek it can backfire sc that can often push you 
from it i think what was called backfire maybe reproducible but there is this sort of defensiveness that we 
when we hear opinions different than ours that can cause us to retrench ek yeah and what i would 
is that that is and one reason a hard thing to reproduce in there are two things here the 
effect which is i think what talking about is actually a little bit different the backfire effect the way 
scientists use it is the idea that even when something that is wrong is disproven that can make you 
it more strongly so if i say to sc why i paused when said a word ek right if 
if you the argument here is something like if you believe the birther attack on barrack obama and then 
read a new york times article saying no he was born in that that can make you believe the 
attack all the more like screw the new york it might be true for some people not as true 
the early studies on that suggested but what saying is also true but i wanna be careful here true 
certain conditions and a place where identity and groups matters a lot a study i talk about in the 
chris bail and other people at duke did the study which is they paid people and this was the 
group they ever did this with or anything like this with who are on twitter they paid them to 
them insert in their twitter feeds members of the other political party influencers from the other political party and 
had a way of defining this and it was people who were very highly followed on the other side 
so they put them in their twitter feeds to see what would happen and what happened was that it 
republicans more conservative to see a bunch of liberals in their twitter feed ek and while the effect was 
statistically significant if it did anything among liberals it was to make them more liberal and this was by 
way testing where they went on policy issues so interesting that it have as big effect on liberals we 
talk i think actually the right thing to say though is more research is needed into why but it 
did not make liberals less liberal that did not happen and the thing i would say there is that 
very big difference between reading the when they are literally the other side talking to their own people in 
way that is gonna piss you off and reading somebody from the other side whom you trust who you 
really see as on the other side and who is actually trying to convince you so one of the 
i sometimes use of this is that if a liberal and you want to see what the other side 
in a way that might affect you somewhat and you start reading breitbart that is not gonna work because 
is there to offend you not actually talking to you they are talking to their own side their whole 
to politics is about exacerbating conflict whereas conversely if you read ross douthat in the new york times that 
a centerright conservative who is tuning his arguments to a liberal audience sc he knows the new york times 
ek he structures it in a way where he grants some points and then he makes his point so 
think it is impossible to have your mind changed certainly not even for me well let me say that 
a sec i think it is impossible to have your mind changed or to construct an informational ecosystem where 
to alternative viewpoints gives you more empathy or even you find some of those viewpoints actually persuasive but the 
people often do it which is they try to read the other side if the other side is not 
to talk to you and it is structured such that you actually feel oppositional towards them it work what 
need is people who you actually think of as on your side they just happen to have some different 
opinions than you do and talking to them so again a very big difference between you have a really 
friend who has some different views on china than you do and you might be willing to listen to 
versus you turn on fox news and laura ingraham is ranting about china and probably not gonna listen to 
sc a really excellent point and i think ever thought of that quite explicitly because i was gonna ask 
can we be better because i know that i and you and everyone else has these biases has these 
has these things we pay attention to so part of the prescription would be we need more people who 
disagree with who are nevertheless trying to talk to us do such people exist either way i know on 
and i really try to get better and better but still way easier to just be sarcastic about dumb 
the other side does than to give a positive substantive pitch to the other side for people that i 
for opinions that i have ek twitter is very bad in general not a good place to do this 
is built to exacerbate conflict and disagreement i have a couple of things to say here one is that 
i wanna say this very clearly these are systems that surround us all including very much me there is 
a thing i argue in the book that not at some point guilty of what trying to in many 
do is understand the system that shapes what i end up doing and what choices i have and so 
is not something where people should ever feel that somebody has escaped it and being criticized this is like 
one of us is trapped inside of it and hard to get any elevation on it i wanna note 
because an important point for me but number two i think there are two questions there one is can 
do things make the system better and the other though is is one of those things to try to 
our own levels of polarization and one thing that has happened in the discourse around polarization is it is 
as a negative word be is bad polarization is bad but as i said earlier most political systems are 
polarized natural reasons you might be polarized you may want your own thinking process to be as clearheaded as 
can get it but even doing that you might still be quite polarized ek in some ways you might 
more polarized possible for instance and i would say this is true that if you wanna have a very 
eyed process that is not overly influenced by american pressure campaigns and politicians and status quo bias on say 
care gonna end up supporting something dramatically to the left of what america has need to necessarily be a 
single payer you may want germanstyle multipayer but nevertheless not gonna be within the boundaries of the middle of 
american debate what our healthcare system is ridiculous and terrible on every level so i think that this will 
depolarize you and i necessarily think it needs to the thing that i do tell people to do more 
i tell them to try to if you wanna find people who listen to from the other side i 
great and everybody should do it ek and i can give you my recommendations for people on both sides 
that but i think the thing people should do that is the most useful not just for the system 
for them personally is to engage less with national politics and more with state and local politics that we 
over the past couple of decades for a bunch of reasons some of them technological some of them in 
of the overall media financial system and business models some of them just having to do with what has 
in american politics people have in general made a huge turn towards nationalizing their political information and nationalizing their 
identities and i have a lot of evidence about this in the book it rather than being on twitter 
off tweets about how donald trump is bad into the ether actually join some group near you that does 
political work actual activism or interest group or helping people fill out their taxes in your community whatever it 
be and move some of your political news consumption over to state and local sources ek just because those 
important identities much more nourishing to be involved locally and like a very powerful form something that is very 
at restraining polarization is local political identity for a very long time one of the ways that the parties 
polarization reasonably low or lower in america is yeah it may be true that a republican but a republican 
this one district in oklahoma and if you voted for that bill they would help you rebuild the bridge 
that one district in oklahoma and so yeah that was a democratic bill and a republican but from oklahoma 
what matters is that your people have a bridge and this is how politics worked for a long time 
then under john boehner they got rid of earmarks ek and i would say getting rid of the earmarks 
more of a symptom than a cause of nationalization but it was also an accelerant of nationalization and so 
more people reinvest in state and local political identities i think the healthier politics will tend to be but 
just be able to change things people might listen to you you have more ability to affect them more 
in many ways push people not to just think about how to modulate their national political identities but how 
reinvigorate their more local ones sc but the thing about the earmarks is interesting because i was gonna ask 
just the game theory of it if you are a politician i had this amateurish theory that over time 
have just become better at working in their personal selfinterest which is mostly getting reelected and if the process 
we have to get elected is first you get nominated by your party and then you run against the 
party and most parts of the country are predominantly one party or the other and the primary election is 
the important one then driven to extremism or at least driven to identify very strongly with that feelings about 
whole suite of issues is that at all sensible here or is that two systems ek yeah completely true 
great line from the political scientist julia azari in the book and her line is central fact of this 
is that we live in a period of weak parties and strong so one way of saying what saying 
that not just that you have to run in your own primary but it used to be that your 
party controlled that primary in a relatively official way so to use maybe presidential primaries as the example here 
used to decide who was gonna be the presidential candidate through a convention vote and there were examples of 
votes needing to be retaken hundreds of times as the different groups horse traded and so donald trump could 
have been the republican party nominee cause he would have never won delegates at a convention ek he could 
be the republican party nominee after reforms made to the primary process so that primaries were actually quite binding 
so that thing where primaries are not just important and we just gerrymandered and sorted such that people tend 
run in elections that whoever wins the party nomination is gonna win from the relevant party but also made 
we like to think of it as small d democratic but in fact very few people vote in say 
house primary very few people vote in senate primaries and so in fact in making them small d democratic 
made them very unrepresentative because it is the small group of activists and party loyalists who come out and 
you have to be very afraid of them and not that afraid of anyone else ek look if in 
or south carolina just not gonna lose at the senate level to a democrat not gonna happen and so 
couple of years ago in utah bob bennett was beat in a primary by mike lee bob bennett was 
conservative republican but he also was known for working with democrats like with ron wyden on a particular health 
called the healthy americans act and that was part of why he was beaten and you see this playing 
in different places and so yes it is i think your game theory there is more or less right 
i do wanna note that not just primaries necessarily but also the weakness of parties sc right and it 
also a relationship to this small d democratization in the sense of the question direct is our democracy versus 
mediated is it through we vote for people and let them make i had a wonderful podcast with edward 
who is a historian about the fall of the roman republic and the roman republic fell and became an 
but it lasted for five hundred years and it really worked well for those five hundred years in part 
it defined itself in opposition to greek democracy which was direct so anytime you wanted to have a military 
the whole citizenry would vote on what to do and it turned out to be a disaster but i 
that i can clearly see advantages and disadvantages in handing more power to the elites to make these decisions 
decisions make a little bit more wisely but maybe gonna also have their own interests in mind is this 
where we even have an intelligent conversation about this these days ek it is not something where we have 
intelligent conversation sc okay chuckle ek let me take this in two conflicting directions one is that larry bartels 
chris achen in their book democracy for realists which is a book very much recommend people read they make 
i think they have a nice little name for it that forgetting now but they basically say that in 
whenever there is a problem in democracy our answer is always more democracy we just have a value system 
that never allowed to say that the problem with this small d democratic process is that it has gone 
far and you should ratchet it back you always have to be at least in theory appealing to a 
d democratic instinct now that might lead you to say and similarly what i just said about primary conventions 
might you lead to say we should get rid of that we should move back towards elite gatekeepers and 
and maybe there are places where that might be true but on the other hand i would say that 
we actually were a democracy a small d democracy donald trump be president and mitch mcconnell be the senate 
leader and republicans have built this firewall at the supreme court and i think be in better shape ek 
of what is the problem in our system right now is that we live in a democracy we live 
a very weird political system that amplifies the power of rural mostly white and affluent voters and so through 
distortive lens there was just a paper that came out showing mathematically that because of the electoral tilt towards 
areas that republicans should be expected to win of presidential contests where they closely lose a popular vote pretty 
i think so you can imagine a system where it really was majority vote rules and in that world 
think the republican party would have to moderate quite a bit if they were gonna continue being competitive at 
national level which it could do by the way charlie baker and larry hogan are very popular republican governors 
blue states but right now republicans are winning elections in spite of losing more votes and so on the 
hand i am sympathetic to claims that we have gone too far in the direction of breaking down gatekeepers 
the other hand i find that the argument that we are too undemocratic has more immediacy and more power 
the argument that we are overly small d democratic sc which quite let give me a prescription for making 
better but there are things to keep in mind while we try to make things better yeah one of 
aspects that puzzles me is just that if there is this you just talked about if the republicans just 
a slightly lower popular vote is it surprising that the polarization sorts us into approximately groups ek it is 
surprising i have talked a couple things on this frances lee wrote a great book political scientist at maryland 
insecure majorities and what she shows and i have this chart in the book which everybody should buy what 
shows is that this is the most competitive era in american politics ever for most of american political history 
what they call sun and moon parties we have had a modified oneparty system there was a long period 
republicans held power after the civil war long period where democrats tended to hold power after the great depression 
can sometimes miss this in retrospect because the presidential level has been a lot more competitive than the congressional 
but if you aggregate all this together what you used to have is long periods of functional oneparty dominance 
much larger majorities than you have here and so that led me to lee argues that this is a 
reason for polarization and winnertakesall politics that always so close to either winning or losing power that it creates 
desperation this noholdsbarred nature to the political tactics and approaches that endorse and so everything is in a state 
constant edge competition ek always playing like overtime and one point down but it led me to ask her 
others why why are we so wellsorted right now why is it so and political scientists do not have 
answer to this question and i have my theories specifically i have a theory that the media plays to 
a nationalized political media plays a thermostatic function where because the media is reasonably oppositional to whoever is in 
it tends to cover scandals and mistakes the media likes conflict it likes negativity and because whoever is out 
power is more desperate and you can nationalize that desperation much more easily now i suspect that creating a 
of a thermostatic result but nevertheless weird genuinely weird this is a weird period in american politics we have 
very good answer for why happening and nobody has a real theory of how it will change sc i 
that this is why we need more the physics of politics this is the book gonna write chuckle sc 
but you also mentioned the media this is the final thing that i really sort of wanted to home 
on to the extent that things are changing and to the extent that we want to look for a 
or structural explanations rather than just blaming mitch mcconnell or bill clinton or whatever the biggest obvious change had 
the past several decades is in the way people get their information it seems that way to me anyway 
twitter or whether just the fact that we read screens or whether the fact that we all watch walter 
at night despite this homeostatic impulse to keep conflict going is it clear that a relationship between increased polarization 
the fragmentation of the media or is that just a correlation that may or may not be causal ek 
i have a chapter on the media i think the media is a huge player here i know that 
would say i think it is the main player or like the only thing or the main thing that 
changed this period but no doubt that the media is a huge player in polarization and pull out a 
of things there the way the media has changed is that we have entered into an era of choicebased 
nationalized choicebased media and so i have great research in here from markus prior and i talk with people 
jonah peretti from buzzfeed and my background is in media and started an organization and the whole thing so 
this from all of the different angles but it used to be that people bought a television to watch 
and then they were also there when the news happened right the news happened the same time every night 
like all of them did the news at the same time every night that was how that worked ek 
issue with radio you might get a newspaper because you want to get the sports section but on the 
page is politics what markus prior and others have found is that as we entered into the era of 
news and then internet news what happened is we sorted by preference so there was a theory that with 
this information become much more knowledgeable about politics and that happen and what had happened is that the people 
were very invested and interested in politics became much much much more knowledgeable whereas the people who like political 
just opted out altogether and so one of the key things here and this is why slightly reverse the 
on what you said is that the media had to be in competing for a much more polarized audience 
okay ek because that was the audience that was still interested so the people who it used to have 
you had a local newspaper monopoly or there were only three network news channels they were gone and by 
way in some ways more like early forms of the media in this country newspapers used to just be 
outlets most newspapers in the early period of the country were funded or attached in explicit way to political 
and why still see something like the arizona republic used to be called the arizona republican the arkansas democratgazette 
is a democratic paper not anymore but how they were started ek so you can still see vestiges of 
in the media now but so but what happened in the century is that went away we had these 
business models or governmentgranted monopoly business models and what trying to do there was be inoffensive you needed everybody 
might shop at the department store to read your newspaper and that meant you be swinging too far to 
side or the other ek as we entered this era of unbelievable choice and attentionbased media and people who 
not like politics could watch the home gardening network and people who did like politics could watch cable news 
turned out that the audience for politics were people who already had very strong opinions very strong political identities 
why would you actually be paying that much attention and that forced the media to run more polarized and 
polarizing stories which in turn polarizes the audience this is another one of these feedback loops the audience gets 
polarized the media becomes more polarized to compete and it kinda keeps going on like that if you compare 
intensity call it of new york times or washington post headlines to where they were fifteen or twenty years 
no comparison even the very august institutions still understood as trying to hew to some version of changed a 
ek and so i think the media is a very big player here but i see the media like 
else as operating within a system it so much that people in the media woke up one day and 
like to polarize the that the country polarized their audience polarized and as they began to write still good 
reasonable stories that ended up with them developing more polarized audiences and then you would have more competition from 
rise of a fox news or something and that creates pressure on the system so choicebased hypercompetitive media is 
be a polarizing form of media and what seen sc i mean it seems to me correct me if 
here you are the expert but even evident to me i think at vox ek yes absolutely sc it 
to me that at the beginning it was trying much harder to be completely nonjudgmental about things and just 
language the rhetoric is a bit more like on this is chuckle ek i actually know that i agree 
that i think true about vox in a big way not sure i think true about our beginning in 
ways i think i know if say toned down i think a hard thing in this is trump made 
this a lot harder sc yeah that is definitely a factor ek this is another way in which the 
the reality dealing with is hard for me to state clearly what is going on in the white by 
way even when people in the white house are telling me going on in the white house is to 
things that sound like almost slander president is president is saying a bunch of incoherent things about president made 
bunch of bigoted statements president made fun of president i mean literally just a couple of days ago now 
retweeted some random person on twitter who had photoshopped chuck schumer and nancy pelosi into muslim garb and said 
love the for me to say clearly what is going on has just become itself more polarizing ek so 
of what seeing there is i think an accurate rendering of reality that said i am somebody i come 
the blogging background worked at the washington post and so on but i believe in saying clearly what i 
we found and what i think is true but i have a lens a liberal person and i have 
values and commitments and i try very hard to look for the truth but no doubt that at some 
i believe immigrants coming into this country are a good thing not a bad thing and that inflects how 
cover things or i think gay marriage is a good thing not a bad thing so vox like a 
of places does not hew to an idea that you should write story headlines where it is unclear what 
conclusion of the story is or write stories where unclear what the conclusion of the story is but vox 
in the age of social media and so like a lot of groups that are in the social media 
think that made our headlines more overheated and more polarizing sc punchy yeah ek and so i think my 
is we do a pretty good job in the context we have but no doubt and see this very 
in the media chapter that something working through there is that i think the incentives of the media right 
are to be very polarizing to be very blunt the struggle of vox is to keep it from becoming 
polarizing and not to get it there like where twitter wants to pull you is way to the left 
way to the right and a constant fight to keep people hewing to an open process and making sure 
reporters are talking to people they agree with and so on and so forth sc well good this leads 
into what i promise will be the final question you raised the consideration that the word polarization has this 
valence it sounds bad but maybe not always bad maybe some interest in having it there but on the 
i agree with that but there is certainly a cost if nothing else at the personal level the amount 
anxiety induced by talking to people and the other side of the aisle seems to me to be much 
now even in our families or in our neighborhoods than it was ten years ago and part of that 
trump but i think that his fault i think that it is a bigger thing is there some worry 
a social fabric issue that we get along all we can do is fight the other side and see 
wins ek yeah yeah i think there is every reason to worry about that i think at this juncture 
has gotten so bad that i am deeply worried about our social fabric over the long term trump has 
made this in my view a lot worse but as i was saying earlier in the i think our 
fabric was coming apart in a much more profound way and i would also argue that one thing about 
is that the alternative to polarization is often suppression what was very polarizing in the was that a lot 
disagreements that had been bottled up were forced into the open like say over civil rights the dixiecrats for 
long time kept consideration of civil rights and antilynching bills off of the floor of the house or senate 
so that debate was suppressed when they lost the power to do that we began having the debate and 
led to a sharp polarization in the country ek so one i think it is okay to have difficult 
i think the thing where people feel they have trouble talking about politics with their families also sometimes reflects 
become unused to having political disagreement because we sort into places and hang out with people who tend to 
a lot like us particularly if very into politics and so sometimes only around that thanksgiving table that you 
out with people who you both love and have to talk to every year but who really think differently 
you do and sometimes having people that you need to toughen up a little bit about that that said 
doubt that i think polarization is tough on a society and i think this is really important it is 
it quite impossible to govern in a country where what you need to do is win the house and 
win the senate with its super majority filibuster requirement for most bills and get the president on board and 
on how you wanna look at it have a favorable ruling from the supreme court ek yeah like polarization 
that many veto points and many many many inside that that i mention what polarization tends to do is 
paralysis and i think one thing that makes these fights harder and worse is that people are frustrated by 
problems not actually being solved and while they may not love the way the other party would solve them 
actually think be better if parties were able to govern if their majority agendas they were just able to 
them and then people could evaluate the outcomes of that but absent the ability of parties to actually govern 
caught in this endless struggle for power that you never quite achieve to enact a governing agenda never quite 
to enact such that the american people can never really judge you based on what did or happen ek 
so yeah polarization interacts very badly and very dangerously with our system in particular parliamentary systems if you get 
you can govern in our system nothing like that guarantee and so very worried about polarization but the particular 
i make is that i think a lot of people will listen to an analysis like that and say 
gotta bring down and for reasons i try to show in the book i think gonna happen i think 
feedback loops it has kicked off are very hard to stop and very unlikely to change what i do 
is possible as you could imagine if we wanted to a political system that worked better amidst polarization some 
that could just be bombproofing against the worst possible outcomes like no reason we should have a debt ceiling 
all such that we could trigger a global financial crisis for no reason just not do that as other 
do that and not create the possibility for one side or the other to trigger a huge financial catastrophe 
but you can also imagine getting rid of the filibuster you can imagine forms of proportional representation that would 
to multiparty systems which could have some good effects on this i think it would be good for dc 
puerto rico to be states i would in many ways restructure american politics quite radically given a magic wand 
for all the reasons i just said about polarization making it hard to do anything it makes it very 
to systemically change the nature of the american political system so i have a ton of optimism that my 
there is gonna get followed sc no but we need the rule here at mindscape is we end on 
optimistic note so the optimistic note ek man your podcast works very differently than my podcast sc very chuckle 
there is an optimistic note there and i like the idea that the impossiblesounding task of reducing polarization the 
we should be devoted to working in an environment where there is polarization and nevertheless having a functioning government 
of that maybe you say it out loud but we also have to work to guarantee the rights of 
tinier party right that is what our governmental system was meant to do and gone a little bit too 
but i think that if where we focus our efforts maybe we can make things better ek that seems 
a good optimistic note to end on sc alright the book is called polarizedhow i managed to write a 
book without including a ezra klein thanks very much for being on the mindscape podcast ek thank you sean 
great podcast a number of counterintuitive insights which are always welcome so thanks for that ek mentioned that he 
provide a list of people to read from the political party even though he suggests that this is only 
effective maybe posting a list of these writers would be helpful thanks again g fascinating discussion throughout the late 
centuries the democrat bosses owned the political machines in the big cities where millions of catholic immigrants settled and 
democrats hence the one thousand nine hundred sixty election of kennedy as a catholic and first president descended from 
great century imigration the republican party by default was the party of the nonimmigrant queue the post ww growth 
the suburbs and those americans looked back towards the urban centers and perceived them as corrupt plus with their 
affluence led many with an identity with the republicans we can say that party identity comes by default and 
of an intellectual process trump with his real estate background and constant conveyance of his personal work ethic attracts 
traditional century republican suburban voter the only real solution is the moderate majority must come together to select an 
cause and dictate to all incumbents some progress must be made on a given problem say climate change if 
is not done then all incumbents get voted out as an insurance policy this moderate majority can try and 
conjure santa claus from another world where he surely exists to come and be the enforcer we knew him 
be as kids this can be done at all santa cons across the globe i have many favorite mindscape 
but this is a favorite among favorites learned a lot about principles that may increase political polarization also applicable 
relevant here in norway and also about possible techniques for communicating across the division lines already looking forward to 
promised book on the of ezra klien seemed an interesting guest and i hope he continues advocating on this 
topic unfortunately i feel that he has a bit more research to do he lightly teased that our voting 
plays a role in polarization but did not explore this much during the interview this is a tremendous oversight 
my money the voting system is the single strongest factor driving polarization as well as every other aspect of 
political atmosphere for example at he states that political scientists do not know why each major market share is 
is simply not true law is a well established phenomenon explaining why the plurality voting system encourages and reinforces 
domination the majoritarian aspect of the system means a party only needs one of the votes to win an 
it is not surprising that parties reorganize their platforms with that goal in their sights as was mentioned in 
interview with will wilkinson attempting to win over some blocks will alienate others a party that aggressively courts of 
and does not care if they are hated by the rest will have an advantage over a party that 
to be liked by all a little bit before this section at he points out shortcomings of the electoral 
and somewhat romanticizes getting to a system where it really was majority vote rules this misses the point that 
majority rule system is inherently polarizing i hope that in the future ezra devotes more attention to alternative voting 
which do not emphasize majority rule i recommend either approval voting or star voting which both perform very well 
simulation httpselectionsciencegithubiovsesimvse rererelistened to the part about how smart people are better at being wrong because they have more 
to go out and find confirming information this is a really serious bias talk to a truther and know 
lot about the melting points of really good one thanks sean and ezra the nature of poles is two 
and opposites humans are natural information absorption systems and profession of journalism itself is an information delivery system most 
are by nature left or liberal or very few said they entered the profession because they wanted to cover 
shows or local charity events rather the change the world attitude or next watergate reporter is endemic to the 
also a well constructed debate argument may convince voters but a polar opposite or negative attack is harder to 
hence polar politics work better in this short attention span media environment case in point due to the information 
of the dem field most voters were entering the iowa caucus or new hampshire polling place without their minds 
up on which dem to select but were polarized by the idea that trump must be defeated by whoever
