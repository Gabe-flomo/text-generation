to officially take the plunge into the world of podcasting the new show will be called mindscape and will 
consist of me talking to smart people about interesting ideas occasionally it will be me talking by myself about 
of questionable merit a grizzled veteran at appearing on other podcasts and past time i sat in the chair 
today just releasing a short teaser podcast in both audio bottom of this post and video right here form 
week will be a more official launch with several real episodes all of which i had enormous fun recording 
it just be about physics although physics will naturally appear indeed the opportunity to talk about things other than 
is a large part of my motivation here i have planshopes to talk to historians psychologists biologists philosophers artists 
neuroscientists economists writers theologians political scientists musicians and more the video above is just to lure you in almost 
episodes will be audioonly i have a strict release schedule that will depend on other obligations i would guess 
every two weeks perhaps weekly if things start going superwell so if you want more episodes encourage others to 
typical episodes will be an hour long at least to start though hold me to that right now you 
both subscribe to the rss feed andor to an email list both available on the sidebar to the right 
you join the email list you can choose to either get just the episodes as they are released or 
special announcements relevant to the podcast or both soon i hope to be available on itunes and google play 
various other platforms but not sure how quickly that happens there be any ads to start but i am 
to monetize it if things go well these microphones pay for themselves not really in it for the money 
if money starts rolling in my incentive to keep going will be correspondingly boosted feel free to leave comments 
discuss individual episodes as they appear there is also a subreddit which might make a good conversation spot like 
else i do that physics research this is a hobby and might have to take a temporary back seat 
things get busy but so far been a lot of fun and excited to see where it will go 
notes for this episode i mention a study of the different ways in which artists and regular people look 
images which you can read about here and ready to go thanks to everyone who has helped me set 
up including gia mora web and technical help julian morris prodding cara santa maria podcasting wisdom jason torchinsky art 
pyne music robert alexander gear and jennifer ouellette patience support wine comment here if you have suggestions for good 
to talk about good people to talk to or formattechnical wisdom as always demands that i not talk about 
or that will be summarily deleted those are my choices to make not anybody still very new at this 
both technical and judgmental are practically guaranteed to happen but optimistic that it should be a fun ride decided
