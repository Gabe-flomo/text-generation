show episode transcript sean carroll hello everybody and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll guest is 
anthony pinn a professor in the religion department at rice university now do not be alarmed despite being a 
in the religion department and in fact despite describing himself as a theologian dr pinn is an atheist a 
not to say that we will not occasionally have actual religious people actual theologians on the podcast but that 
is not today anthony pinn has a very interesting trajectory he grew up in upstate new york where he 
a child preacher so at age he was standing up there in the pulpit preaching sermons bringing people to 
and he was really good at it it actually was quite the calling that he had he went on 
college in fact to divinity school but then along the way he lost his faith he got the idea 
he was trying to help people in underprivileged communities he really think that god was helping them he really 
that his christianity was helping the cause of bringing these lives to a better state so he ultimately lost 
faith but he lose interest in the idea of helping people so he stayed a selfdescribed theologian but now 
tries to bring humanism to people rather than christianity and in particular he tries to bring humanism to the 
american community where atheism agnosticism humanism are not very popular sc if you look at different demographic groups in 
united states i just looked it up only of blacks in the united states describe themselves as completely atheist 
to something like of latinos of whites of asians so somehow if an atheist saying are we doing wrong 
we reaching these if a christian you might say are the african americans doing right why are they so 
better at maintaining their faith than the rest of americans well i imagine a better person to talk to 
these issues than anthony pinn the author of many books not gonna list them all here you can look 
up on his web page but a few of the more recent ones are when colorblindness the answer humanism 
the challenge of race the end of godtalk an african american humanist theology and a very interesting semiautobiographical book 
writing obituary how a good methodist became a better atheist sc so gonna talk about all these things gonna 
about the time that dr pinn taught a course at rice on religion and hip hop two other parts 
human culture that you often hear put together but it makes for a great little stew of intellectual topics 
gonna have a lot of fun go music sc alright anthony pinn welcome to the podcast anthony pinn great 
be with you sc so the point that trying to get across for many of these podcasts the conceit 
you will is that after the ideas the big ideas i wanna figure out how we can think about 
world how we can learn about it less about individual autobiographies or anecdotes and so forth but thinking that 
we should make an exception a little bit sometimes you get to some big ideas by personal autobiography right 
sure sure sc so why we tell our listeners a little bit about where you started and how you 
where you are ap well i grew up in buffalo new york very much involved in the church started 
the path to ministry as a preteen and moved through ordination so by the time i was finishing my 
year of college i could marry bury and baptize people i was the youth pastor at a rather substantial 
in brooklyn new york but i was struggling a bit come from a rather conservative southern baptist high school 
feeder program for institutions like bob jones university sc okay yeah which we know well ap let that sink 
yeah and so i get to new york and taking classes and of course i thought i needed to 
in religion because i loved religion but encountering students and faculty who thought of the bible as simply a 
of literature and not necessarily very good literature and so this was throwing me and encountering people who adhere 
a variety of traditions all of them from my vantage point led to hell and they were unapologetic about 
involvement it was throwing me for a loop and encountering young people this is the early encountering young people 
brooklyn who are having an easier time thinking about their death than thinking about a bright and productive future 
what i could offer them through my tradition amounted to nothing and so over the course of those four 
i started rethinking faith still committed to ministry but rethinking faith sc so you working as a minister and 
as a student at the same time right ap and as a student right right and rethinking faith but 
i needed to get out of new york city to think through these issues without the pressure of ministry 
my church people wanted me to have answers not good questions just answers they had enough question sc the 
answers please yes ap yes yes yes and so i decided to go to an institution that really care 
much about ministry it was about ideas and during the course of the master of divinity program the professional 
for ministry my thinking began to shift and by the time i was a phd student i realized i 
to make a decision i could be a custodian of the tradition and forget about the misery and the 
that people encountered or i could move beyond theism and concern myself with what people encountered on a daily 
so i contacted the minister of the local church i was involved with and the bishop of my denomination 
african methodist episcopal church and gave my resignation and never looked back sc well and so this was at 
divinity school ap yes yes sc and when were you there exactly ap i was at harvard through sc 
so we overlapped i graduated with my phd from harvard ap right right sc so i would have i 
almost no connection with people in other schools except for the graduate student council intramural basketball leagues was there 
chance that we played basketball against each other ap i played at the law school every saturday but just 
up sc oh okay just pick up you formally there ap no no sc did you play against barack 
you overlapped with him too ap a couple of times sc yeah okay ap a couple of times sc 
you did you play with him and go like guy is gonna be president some ap well all of 
buzz about him suggested he was really special sc right ap at the divinity school and then the graduate 
school of arts and sciences and everyone knew about him sc yeah okay good i know about him but 
was in a moving in different circles ap yeah sc okay so it sounds like you had a journey 
being a child preacher to atheism that was mostly driven by what we could call practical concerns about your 
to successfully minister and that is it safe to say that sort of what nudged you into a change 
world view ap oh sure sure what i believed theologically and what i practiced religiously did not line up 
what people were actually encountering in the world it did not give me a way of addressing misery sc 
right i always wonder because in philosophical or theological circles we debate whether god exists we prove that god 
or exist and always thought that these debates had essentially zero impact on belief structures like the reasons why 
actually believe one thing or another usually at least biographically come from these more practical concerns i remember a 
of mine i taught a course at the university of chicago for undergraduates on the history of atheism and 
were both atheists we were a little worried we trying to proselytize we wanted to make the religious students 
the class comfortable and so we worried talking about all these proofs or arguments for and against the existence 
god whether people would get no one cares make any impact on them but when we talked about how 
bible had been written the history as you say of the bible as a work of literature some people 
a little upset like that was hitting them at a place that they really thought about before ap oh 
yeah and i think absolutely right those debates only accomplish so much because theological commitments and religious practice are 
nothing reasonable about this faithdriven and so even much of this evidence will be used by theists to prove 
point for many of them who grew up like i grew up even this rigorous debate this effort to 
the faith proves that on the right path because the devil is out to get them sc yeah a 
falsifiable theory right ap right sc nothing that can happen in the world where say how god and the 
would have arranged right ap exactly right right right sc but you felt mostly that it helping your faith 
not actually giving you answers that would improve lives in an interesting important way ap it most certainly was 
because some of this struggle for these young folks at first in brooklyn and then in roxbury where i 
before i left the church they are literally dying crack cocaine is taking them out sc yeah late early 
yes and nothing about church practice kept them safe sc but they have agreed they would have said that 
was an important part of their lives at the time ap i think for some of them it was 
commitment this is what their family did this was what black people do on a sunday but i think 
for them raised questions that they tried to push to the side because of these other obligations sc and 
retrospect would you say that if as a phd now as a professor if someone asked you to explain 
defend your views of the world your ontological views about the nature of reality is it the same answer 
would you did you come to atheism for the right reasons or do you have better reasons now ap 
came to atheism for reasons that made a tremendous amount of sense and based upon the condition of the 
the environment of which we are a part and human life those reasons are still sound sc right and 
are someone who is happy to characterize yourself as religious although you are an atheist is that accurate ap 
and done that for a variety of reasons as i initially moved into atheist and humanist circles there was 
failure to recognize what humanism and atheism mean for some folks there are ways in which we were reluctant 
talk about the nature of community and interactions so there was no real interest in talking about ritual there 
limited conversation concerning the wonder of life and so i posed that initially to break that stranglehold but it 
for me was a matter of this that i think for humanists and atheists the real target is theism 
religion those two overlap but they are not synonymous sc exactly right religion is a much more broad expanse 
category than theism ap oh most certainly sc and by opposing atheism to theism that makes sense but then 
you say that your atheism undermines religion a lot of stuff left a lot of questions ap most certainly 
certainly on one level based upon a false assumption that all religious people are theists sc right nietzsche got 
right he pointed out that god is dead okay what are you gonna do about it now i think 
lot of atheists have this view that realizing that our best scientific philosophical explanations of the world include room 
god that was the hard part and once we get that done then now we can just be good 
and the easy thing i see it exactly the opposite way around that was the easy part figuring out 
god exist now easy two thousand years ago maybe not but what are we gonna do about it leaves 
lot of discussion yet to have right ap oh most certainly and he was right on target nietzsche was 
on target not simply enough to take god off the throne the challenge is can we leave that throne 
and we tend to put in place of god other categories that strangle us in very similar ways sc 
you talk about ontology what the world is made of at a fundamental level you are not theist obviously 
naturalist is that fair to say ap fair to say but that question occupy a lot of my time 
okay ap and so i tend to do this in reverse the question for me is necessary in order 
make life productive what is the best vocabulary the best grammar of life that allows us to flourish and 
from there move to these issues of ontology sc and so happy to call yourself religious in the sense 
you think that there should be some set of ways i know i put words in your mouth tell 
what does it mean how do we rephrase the other roles of religion other than saying that god exists 
well religion for me is this i think of religion as a strategy and a way of interrogating human 
so if we think about human experience for example as cookie dough laid out religion would be that christmas 
cookie cutter a way in which we isolate certain moments of human experience for interrogation but it substantive so 
to move away from a sense of religion as sui generis that is to say moved away from a 
of religion as something in and of itself a kind of special experience no just a way of interrogating 
experience and i think whether theists or atheists we isolate and interrogate moments of human experience sc and a 
of theology and so sort of happy to use words like theology and religion now other people maybe even 
would say if using words like theology and religion like it or not people associate these words with various 
it a little bit dangerous to put ourselves in that basket or is there more to be gained by 
can be a religious atheist or religious ap my attitude has always been this that there are elements of 
religious theological language that are still productive elements that like god right that language needs to go away but 
are elements of that language that are still useful and unwilling to let theists just have this right sc 
ap being loud and persistent sufficient claim to this and so it seems to me still something about this 
that allows us to remain open to the wonder of life sc right and something struck me i was 
in japan a few weeks ago and always been struck by churches by cathedrals especially in europe the grand 
and something about them some human beings hit on a way to design a space where when you walk 
you feel something and in japan going to buddhist temples the same thing like some people across the world 
would you say that we have somehow seeded that to theists and maybe we should recapture that to try 
have a humanist way of constructing these spaces should we even call them sacred or transcendent what is the 
we should use there ap i like the vocabulary of sacred and secular because i think there is an 
split and so i find those two terms particularly useful from my vantage point i think humanists and atheists 
simply forgotten that we construct these spaces not riverside church moma sc yeah guggenheim etc ap exactly but we 
these spaces that open us to a different range of questions the big questions of life who are we 
are we when are we why are we we have those spaces but forgotten to name them sc i 
that the university of pittsburgh they have the tall building called the cathedral of learning and i get that 
this is my how much should humanists try to more or less directly mimic the practice of religion should 
i know that some people have secular weekly meetings been to talks by atheists small gatherings where not only 
there a sermon but they passed around a collection plate are we just making excuses for not having all 
wonderful practices of religion or are these things that we can hope to really replace ap i think a 
to try to mimic these theistic ritual moments it does not work well i think ethical culture and the 
unitarian universalist association are prime examples of how poorly that works sc okay ap in part because it those 
of services allow us to fully recognize appreciate and act on what is uniquely us what is unique about 
philosophy of life and so i think the hard work is in front of us and that involves developing 
of celebrating community and ritualizing life that speak directly to what it means to be a humanist or an 
as opposed to taking something and rendering it no longer christian but christianlite sc right right you wanna just 
down the existing things but this is a asking lot right i mean how to build up a form 
life after removed a lot of the excuses or justifications that we had for all these practices we used 
have is it is it working are people actively pursuing this is it gonna happen ap i think really 
i think in too many circles people confuse asking the questions with doing the work sc right right ap 
so we fail to recognize this so even the occasion that brought us to las vegas the american humanist 
this is a ritualized activity if we think about ritual simply as a repeated activity in founded space right 
magical about that or theistic about it just people getting together for a particular purpose and doing this over 
over again this is what this gathering is but kind of wiped out our ability to understand this as 
ritualizing of life a getting together that celebrates community sc but how does it happen so is it purely 
or should we be a little bit more topdown about it should we try explicitly consciously to invent rituals 
will they just appear ap i think it requires some intentional work sc yeah ap and the question is 
to do that exactly and i know the sc yeah okay ap but i know it happen if we 
about it sc i mean universities are pretty good at it right pomp and circumstance just had several students 
their phds ap the hooding ceremony sc yeah exactly those kinds of ceremonies so suggesting that will be part 
how we recover these forms of life that used to belong to religion or to theistic religion we can 
have that ap oh sure but we first have to recognize that theists own those moments utilized them had 
good pr around them but they own them and it seems to me this is also vital if we 
to grow this is one of the questions i hear over and over again why we getting bigger and 
folks from this community participate with us and why there more africanamericans well we give them a soft place 
land they already know theism work why looking for something different sc so a lot of atheists wanna give 
an argument for not existing and what saying is you need a lot more than that ap yes replace 
losing sc right and so how do we do it is it the american humanist association or is it 
on blogs where do you find these communities ap i think for a lot of folks gone online but 
i have the answer but i think i have a really good question we ought to wrestle with and 
think how this happens at its best involves local organizations local communities that are able to address particular needs 
desires in realtime as opposed to the national organization saying this is what you need to do in cleveland 
this is what you need to do in san francisco let local folks figure this sc no atheist pope 
no atheist hierarchy ap no there be laughter sc there right but what so someone might say the rituals 
great but some people need the promise of salvation they need to believe that something bigger that comes after 
what do we tell them ap here is my thinking that we are already involved in something that is 
than the individual we are individuals within the context of communities and it seems to me this recognition of 
larger thing we call life that serves as the humbling moment for us not god or gods the fact 
we are involved in this process of life that is bigger than we are sc yeah i would love 
ask you tough questions about this but i agree with you so much that i find it difficult had 
say to me without god without something bigger than our lives here on earth how can you find meaning 
can you why does it matter just gonna die just chemical reactions how can you possibly associate that with 
meaningful and i wanna say how what else matters this is the life leading ap exactly exactly and so 
turn to people like richard wright or web du bois or albert camus who provide strategies provide insights on 
you move through life without those sorts of assurances or what albert camus calls this grand unity and it 
the deep desire and the effort to make life more comfortable to provide healthy life options for all and 
that this involves a much softer relationship with the world sc and i know that also emphasized music quite 
bit i love it in one of your books when you talk about the blues and its relationship to 
i never really thought about it this way but i think you make the point a lot of the 
blues songs were if not openly secular then at least skeptical of the religious traditions in which the artists 
singing is that right ap yeah or an important fact to keep in mind that for centuries it was 
for people of african descent to learn to read and write and so for us to probe this community 
assume that their humanism or their atheism is written in books is just ridiculous they allowed to learn to 
and write but it mean they think and express themselves and so one of the easier ways one of 
vehicles available to them was music and so we accurately date the spirituals we know when spirituals begin in 
same way we accurately date the blues a mistake to think in terms of the early century and race 
blues is older than that and whereas the spirituals are all about theism divine forces breaking into human history 
blues hold all of that suspect and the blues demonstrate a comfort with and an ease with the nature 
life the kind of messy nature of life sc and that goes all the way up to hiphop is 
accurate to say ap oh most certainly most certainly sc i know you taught a course on hiphop and 
yes yes sc not on hiphop and humanism what is the difference there ap well with this course there 
several things i wanted to accomplish one i wanted my university to think differently about hiphop as a culture 
stop simply assuming that this is bad stuff right on one level mistaken because while hiphop artists need to 
held accountable for their misogynistic viewpoints and etcetera etcetera a mistake to assume that they created these problems sc 
in a context they came from a culture look admit when it comes to hiphop a very old man 
think that everything after eric b and rakim has just been downhill since then paid in full but i 
that the kids today have their own artists that they like very much and it is a way one 
of finding meaning right ap certainly and so what we try to do is give a sense of the 
between hiphop and traditional forms of religiosity christianity islam for example but we also look at the ways in 
hiphop culture constitutes an alternate religious orientation but then we also look at the ways in which hiphop critiques 
and embraces something more humanistic in nature sc so how does that happen do you have examples really not 
with that ap well so if you look at someone like jayz think in terms of jayz and kanye 
in the that song dismantles all of the major sources of authority in human civilization and they also as 
of that process bring into question the utility of the god idea and even more fully expressed by jayz 
the track and the solo album that comes around the time of church in the and in that he 
the idea of god and you get something along these lines in it if fear is the only god 
getting people out of fear is his only job right kind of dismantling all of this and a much 
materialistic viewpoint or you get a kanye west who has a song am a that just kind of dismantles 
much of what typically thought about theism or even if we move in the direction of the five percenters 
think about hiphop and the five percenters sc why you explain more about what the five ap well during 
early a figure clarence in manhattan who has questions concerning the nation of islam and his argument is the 
of islam is not teaching the truth it knows the truth but not teaching the truth that he argues 
nation of islam argues that black people are made in the image of god they have a direct relationship 
allah but clarence argues no no no the black man is god not made in the image of god 
sc is that secretly an atheist move there ap well i think i think it certainly opens up it 
it remove metaphysics it radically alters what we can even mean by metaphysics sc maybe a humanist move is 
fair way to say it right ap i would think so ap yeah and so five percent nation named 
because they argue that of the population think in terms of nation of islam has truth but they teach 
right of the population just ignorant and they will follow anyone who sounds good only of the population has 
knowledge and these are the poor righteous teachers the five percenters and five percenters as you know as a 
of rakim you know that the five percenters are big within hiphop culture but they provide a very different 
of thinking about how theism functions at the very least what you get with the five percenters is a 
of religiosity that is grounded in human history and within the material world sc and a suspicion of authority 
some sense ap oh most definitely if they are correct and the black man is god who gets to 
god what to do sc i mean is it accurate to i think read things by you that call 
question the common belief that back in the day around the time of the century say that africanamericans were 
deeply embedded in the christian tradition that sort of the only way they thought you wanna recover a little 
of a humanist tradition even way back then ap that assumption yeah absolutely right that assumption just demonstrates that 
black church has had very good pr the assumption that black people are part of the black church or 
not black sc right ap but if you really give attention to africanamerican thought and life you get a 
that always been a variety of vantage points a variety of systems of thought of philosophies of life that 
competed and some of those strands are humanistic if not atheistic in nature and so part of my responsibility 
of my work has involved trying to surface those for greater attention and investigation sc to countervail some of 
pr that the black church has been so good at ap and to reclaim some of these figures that 
have falsely argued are part of their camp so web du bois for example major figure you cannot really 
about race relations in the century without thinking about his souls of black folk published in a major major 
but in his autobiographical work he makes it clear that he was not a believer sc interesting i did 
know that yeah ap oh no no but nothing really interested in arguing about but he a believer sc 
you can easily imagine that people would say like i have other battles to fight right and maybe even 
through the civil rights movement that kind of thing need to come together believers and nonbelievers a big crisis 
facing that is a little bit more ap and a false assumption what he argues in some of his 
that on a mundane practical level the black church can be useful it has resource it has space but 
buying the theological claims and the same with other figures like james weldon johnson sc mmhmm not familiar with 
ap a fantastic fantastic figure he did this a book called and an analysis of the black sermonic style 
black style of preaching and so black christians have assumed he wrote this one of no he understands the 
of this sort of conversation understanding how ideas get communicated in a rather effective way but he a believer 
his autobiography he makes it clear that as a college student he gave up on god a philip randolph 
figure in the civil rights movement a nonbeliever an atheist but he maintained membership in a church for the 
reason he maintained membership in a union right that this is an organization and it can be helpful in 
of getting us organized but he buy the theology sc right right ap and the list goes on zora 
hurston argued that prayer was for the weakminded sc well a complicated history as far as i know between 
and humanism and race relations generally some of our favorite enlightenment thinkers at the dawn of the scientific age 
things about africans and blacks which make our skin crawl a little bit now and they have descendants today 
are a little bit less popular or mainstream but this use of secular reasoning science and so forth as 
tool for putting down black people and africans that goes way back so we really say we humanists really 
we were right from the start about that ap and we get the question wrong i get this question 
and over again are black people still christians when christianity was used to enslave when the better question for 
is humanism or atheism more attractive to this sc and part of that will be moving away from debating 
for finetuning in cosmology and the existence of god to living our lives better right ap exactly exactly and 
science extremely important no reason to debate that but i think also important when we and we fail to 
this on occasion that even scientists live within the context of cultural worlds and these cultural worlds impinge and 
insufficient to say that nothing real about race so not even bother with it because it has real consequences 
social category that has real consequences life and death sc right and so this is getting to something i 
wanted to talk about because i know that a lot of people in the atheist secular communities would like 
say that our goal should be to be colorblind right our goal should just be to be pure reasoning 
creatures universalists humanists and to just not even notice when someone is white or asian or africanamerican so again 
wanna put words in your mouth i suspect gonna say not at least a good medium term strategy ap 
ridiculous and i say that for a couple of reasons one it paints difference a problem to solve when 
is an opportunity and our strategy ought to be seeing difference but not allowing that prospective on difference to 
populations but also it seems to me that it is problematic not only because poor thinking with respect to 
but it allows whiteness to remain normative because what we end up with are more shades of the same 
and so what people are actually saying it seems to me is okay as long as i can see 
through the values the sensibilities the move through the world that is mine sc yeah people and people of 
and yet it has to do with psychology and how we view the world the lens again another theme 
i wanna emphasize over these podcasts is the lens through which we view the world and our choice of 
you can say many many things that are true statements but emphasizing some things and not emphasizing others and 
hugely important choice that affects what you think is important ap or even the phrase of allows whiteness to 
normative because the assumption is is everyone it seems to me a better phrase is of a despised sc 
little more normative there and people might worry about it but yeah it gets at the point that is 
on here and this gets us into a broader category that goes beyond atheism and humanism there are phrases 
are very powerful that have been used in this discussion like identity politics white privilege and i think that 
can sense it in a lot of atheists that phrases like this make them uncomfortable somehow this is something 
is being worried about that i kind of wanna deal with so do you find these concepts important crucial 
we rehabilitate them should we make sure that atheists are cognizant of what is going on in those levels 
oh most certainly and rethink discomfort that we really make progress on these sorts of issues with people remaining 
that everything about these conversations concerning race gender sexuality class et cetera ought to make us uncomfortable and we 
to see that discomfort as an opportunity to rethink reengage and put in place better strategies sc right discomfort 
something that makes people run away but i like it saying that discomfort can be is not quite sure 
sign that something questionable is being questioned ap yes sc sometimes uncomfortable just because i think people are wrong 
other times because worried that my presuppositions that gone through with life may be colored things in a way 
conscious of ap and it seems to me in both of those instances the question is what does that 
open you to do sc right so what should it ap to rethink assumptions that perhaps what been thinking 
my engagement with issues of race or my engagement with issues of gender maybe my assumptions here are wrong 
i need to rethink maybe i need to listen to what saying do a little homework sc so how 
you define white privilege ap well first thing i would say is we need to move away from the 
that only economic sc not just the amount of money in your bank account ap no nobody who is 
white privilege is simply looking at bank accounts sc although there is that i read just very recently the 
in the boston area the median wealth of a white household is about two hundred forty thousand dollars the 
wealth of an african american household is ap sure and something to this economic issue but not all there 
with respect to white privilege so even poor whites an assumption that what is available within our society all 
best available in our society is rightfully mine i am entitled to this and it gets played out in 
variety of ways give some easy examples right so it may be a matter of privilege if you go 
the restaurant and seated near the restroom and your first thought it because of who i or you go 
the car lot and your thought is i afford this as opposed to much attention from the police will 
car get so there are ways in which this operates that has nothing to do with the bank account 
the assumption that this society is for me sc and certainly in the news recently obviously the last couple 
years heard heard more stories of african americans being shot and killed and at least in the last couple 
weeks heard all of these stories about people calling the cops on an african american they were walking down 
street or sitting in starbucks or something like that presumably these stories have been happening all along and just 
beginning to notice them this is a feature of the attention to which we pay to different things ap 
think certainly part of it and i think there are ways that seeing over the past decade for example 
types of challenges to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a black male with his child in a 
in a park is a threat two black men waiting for a buddy in starbucks are a threat so 
the pursuit of happiness this occupation of space becomes problematic and so it seems to me that if you 
in terms of the most drastic instances death or these other instances of disregard you are not entitled to 
public space all of this really speaks to a sensibility on the part of some in the united states 
black life does not constitute anything that needs to be respected and there is no rightful occupation of time 
space for black bodies sc and it can be hard for a white person who thinks of themselves as 
wellintentioned they would say not a and it can be hard for them to appreciate right like what the 
are that might be very very subtle just from living your life on an in an everyday way because 
the color of your skin ap right the unspoken elements of privilege sc and i think that as a 
a theoretical physicist there are not a lot of african americans in my field a question so what can 
do about that a very analogous question to the misrepresentation of gender in the field also and there are 
definitely people out there arguing well just a clear reflection of underlying distribution of innate abilities but other people 
might say we worry about the representation of african americans in science because we need to just worry about 
them out of poverty right so worrying about getting physicists as african americans is premature right now do you 
feelings about this ap it seems to me that because the issue is so layered and complex we need 
variety of strategies so we do need better representation of african americans and others in higher education but we 
need to start much earlier so we think about the benefit of higher education as a way of breaking 
example the cycle of poverty with high school juniors much too late right we need to start with kindergarten 
grade and put in and put in place a different way of educating a different way of understanding these 
and encouraging them to explore something about life in the context of the united states that wipes out curiosity 
african americans and latinos because curiosity can be dangerous sc interesting so even more so i think that something 
wipes out curiosity for everyone who is in elementary school but saying that especially felt by people in these 
of despised color communities so i heard before you think that this idea that just being curious is dangerous 
might have heard before we have time for that like we need to work on earning a living right 
saying sort of an active force working against asking questions in the way that would lead you to these 
intellectual academic pursuits ap sure definitely and harder for us to recognize this now when a certain type of 
was more prominent the idea that curiosity kind of moving outside of the accepted boundaries could be deathdealing that 
easier for us to get but still something about racial dynamics within the context of the united states that 
make curiosity moving outside of accepted boundaries really dangerous sc and do we combat that with better role models 
more explicit programs at the secondary and elementary and university education levels like what should the strategy be ap 
and more right because the problem is so complex and layered we need a variety of strategies and some 
these strategies have to involve reinvesting in public education for example and kind of highlighting opportunities that really encourage 
reward curiosity but only part of it sc only part of it right yeah and something we can ask 
what individuals should do and something we can ask about what organizations should do and it goes back to 
soft landing question how do we as humanists and secularists create a is it safe to say replace what 
church has offered them ap i would argue we need to do better than these churches sc better than 
church yes ap on one level we should not be holding people hostage so at their worst churches have 
but with a stranglehold giving you this but you better be a part of what doing giving you this 
only after you listen to the sermon and you walk down that aisle we need to do better than 
and so on some level we need to give people a soft place to land but we need to 
in communities and so in part this is why i say this is the kind of work that needs 
take place on the local level so local humanist and atheist organizations need to look and ask the question 
communities were concerned with what do they say they need and then work to provide that sc and could 
imagine working with churches in doing that ap i think that is absolutely necessary for us to partner with 
theists not going to make substantial changes alone sc i know there were slight controversies back in the early 
of blogs i remember about whether or not atheists should partner with churches on climate change because there are 
who said climate change is important if you find someone on your side who cares what their beliefs about 
and others who said yes but beliefs about god are also important and sending mixed messages if we team 
with so on the teaming up side ap yes my argument is this we can maintain the awareness that 
the philosophical level we disagree but in terms and so we might disagree with what motivates our ethics but 
we can agree that we have to do something and we can commit to sharing our resource to get 
done why not sc yeah very good what do you think about sort of the tenor of conversation in 
country these days i wanna get too much into our current president and so forth but resentment of minorities 
people of color of immigrants and so forth does seem to be a feature of certain parts of our 
discourse number one what can we do about that number two what can humanists in particular have to say 
that ap first thing say is we have to recognize that this new this sort of disregard is extremely 
manifest in different ways now but the underlying animosity has been in place has been in place difference has 
us and so i think on one level humanist and atheist organizations need to commit resource to making a 
and this means kind of recognizing from my vantage point recognizing that if we are not concerning ourselves with 
of justice a broad range of issues of justice then we are actually part of the problem sc interesting 
the phrase justice has taken on pejorative connotations would you be happy to call yourself a social justice warrior 
sure sure my humanism make sense to me if it continuously remind me that the world and people are 
sc and what do you say to people who would say i worry about other personal problems in fitting 
this society people should help themselves up what we should do for african americans is let them succeed on 
own rather than trying to help them up ap after i stop laughing say this sc not very good 
asking these questions from the point of view of something i really agree with ap no no i know 
get it but not a level playing field and the fact that we had a black president for eight 
change that it is not a level playing field and so we need to put in place strategies programs 
that reflect the fact that it an even playing field sc do you have a point of view on 
the standard question of what is motivating these midwestern voters who flipped from democrat to republican over the last 
years some people wanna say that inequality economic anxiety others will just point right to racism or fear of 
or resentment your point of view on that ap my initial response was why are people voting against their 
interest but then it hit me that on some level they might be voting against their economic interests but 
they are doing is safeguarding their social stand their social standing right so willing to forego political advantage economic 
for the sake of being able to say whiteness still matters sc do you think explicit or sort of 
the scenes in their minds little bit of both ap i think there are instances when it is extremely 
but i would argue for the vast majority it undergirds their thinking there are ways in which they may 
be aware of it but the power of this social construct called race we have to talk about it 
just assumed its power sc yeah and the thing that to a leftist a liberal always surprising is that 
in disadvantaged circumstances somehow see that disadvantaged or that low down on the economic ladder and they choose to 
other poor people rather than blaming rich people and it seems not an expert on this in any way 
it seems that race and nationality and ethnicity work as proxies to make this happen in a way that 
kind of a fundamental issue for democracy to deal with not just the united states around the world different 
are sort of being threatened by the fact that a lot of people are resentful and wanna become more 
in response ap and i think this element of what those who hold the vast majority of the wealth 
saying about themselves and others right and those who look at them and say what it means to be 
if these successful people are saying these other folks that keeping you from getting their success kind of wins 
and it seems to me something akin to this in the prosperity gospel movement so take someone like creflo 
who is extremely wealthy and his argument is the problem is not following the strategy all laid out in 
opportunity that not and people buy it against the physical evidence because this person who has everything they want 
saying this is the case and it seems to me that this has happened on a larger scale in 
united states those who have are pointing the finger and those who want buy it sc in some sense 
i mean donald trump is rich he must be on the right track right ap it worked for him 
tried to understand how someone can read the new testament and come away thinking that somehow it is glorifying 
success ap ah see but your mistake assuming that christians are actually reading the bible sc well possible but 
are always for every line as far as i can tell for every line in the gospels where jesus 
something like being poor is better than being rich an interpretation a hermeneutics that says what he actually means 
being rich is better a wonderful testament to the cleverness of theological thought ap most definitely sc are we 
to critique hiphop in the same standards there is a glorification of material success ap yeah in that way 
is extremely american in outlook and again my argument would be that we need to hold these artists accountable 
the ways in which they contribute to problems and so i have no issue with that my concern is 
we assume that they are the source of the problem that there was no sexism until hiphop right no 
until hiphop sc do you see it changing do you think that hiphop is evolving in that way ap 
think hiphop has always been complex right and so it seems to me that always been layered had a 
aggressive dimension of hiphop that understood that that drugs for example are the way to success that this is 
way to achieve the american dream and they celebrate that and you get elements of hiphop that are about 
critique public enemy about social critique and rethinking the system so i think these elements have always been present 
now you have in the mix pulitzer prize winner kendrick lamar who has a really complex depiction of life 
the us sc so just to close as the last topic be a little bit more philosophical i know 
you said and i get it that less concerned about metaphysics and ontology and more about the lives that 
lead but okay a connection so back in the day if you wanted to lead a good life you 
ask yourself does god want me to do and it might be very complicated to figure that out but 
at least knew that was the strategy if god exist how do i decide to lead a good life 
to say what i should try to but do we is there some immediately following metaethical strategy for figuring 
what makes a person good or bad ap first thing i would suggest is that humanists and atheists need 
move away from outcomedriven strategies leave that to theists who have divine assistance that kind of keeps things level 
humanists and atheists just us trying to do what we can we need to move away from strategies that 
outcomes that hard work and proper thought will win the day and privilege struggle that in our very effort 
say no to injustice in its various forms we might find something of our own humanity not the outcome 
the process of saying no the process of struggling against and so my answer to that question would be 
need to give attention to strategies that have the potential to create the greatest good aware that they might 
and we might have to start this over again right so not the same sense of loss what happens 
this strategy right an outcomedriven perspective what we need to say is well it may not be right we 
on to another one sc here in las vegas if a poker player an insult that people throw at 
if too resultsoriented if you do the wrong thing but then you get lucky you can get a good 
but you be too happy with yourself you made the wrong play there is randomness right this is kind 
what saying not about the reward about the process getting there but i saw you sneak in there the 
good this is a utilitarian vocabulary there are others who wanna be virtuous or deontological would you call yourself 
in that way ap no not really and i thought that might get popped by you and so for 
i see inadequacies in that but at this point thinking in terms of the greater good is a strategy 
to me i see shortcomings with it but available to me and again not being outcomedriven just seeing process 
ability to say no to what we do recognize as injustice and so so much of what we need 
be doing and thinking with respect to issues of social justice involves negation i have a sense of what 
just world look like sc yes okay you know wrong but yeah ap i know that is wrong i 
sexism get us there i know racism get us there right by negation sc right but okay i think 
our present society is so far away from utopia right that maybe the details of which moral system is 
are less important than the fact that nowhere near any of the potential perfections but even in the journey 
by thinking that well should we be trying to just start everyone with a level playing field and let 
go like almost a more libertarian kind of strategy or should we provide some basic safety net for everyone 
think even these more philosophical questions do come down to practical issues a little bit ap sure and my 
would be we have to provide a safety net we have to provide some resource so if we provide 
resource if we take away the anxiety over basic needs we really progress sc alright do you have any 
thoughts words of wisdom for the young humanists secularists out there who want to be more opening welcoming to 
communities ap i continuously have in the back of my mind the line from the myth of sisyphus by 
and he ends that short essay with this one must imagine sisyphus happy so all we can do is 
the effort to improve circumstances for life sc i agree more in fact i quoted that line from the 
myth of sisyphus in my last book the big picture so good on the right track so anthony pinn 
you so much for joining me today ap thank you music loving the podcast sean really interesting topics and 
but i have to say that the highlight is the funky intro music a compliment about the music and 
not a criticism of the discussions looking forward to more i loved this discussion still hoping you get noam 
on fascinating discussion of atheism in the black community discussion of the blues as challenging the hegemony of theism 
me of billie holiday i think of billie holiday not as having but as having soul a huge fan 
soul music and soul has so many of the elements that pinn was talking about soul is the that 
not about or arcane doctrines but about the vitality of black embodiment of passionate emotions and deep wisdom born 
struggle my recollection is that billie holiday was not interested in formal religion but her singing was about pouring 
the fire of her soul soul does not have to mean an eternal spirit that seeks god soul is 
life energy of the human bodymind tracy fessenden wrote a book about billie art as a kind of that 
also reminiscent of thesis looks at the vernacular devotions scholars call catholicism of the streets the jewishness of the 
the pentecostalism of the roadhouse or the concert tracy fessenden religion around billie holiday psu press the key as 
sean and pinn note is that religion is is based not on reasoned arguments and evidence but primarily on 
and intuition which is not to denigrate the latter as antonio damasio argues these latter are key elements of 
human experience and yes in their zeal to debunk religious arguments the nonreligious have neglected the emotional elements of 
sacred spaces art ritual mythstories etc which basically cedes the ground not that the nonreligious need to mimic said 
but rather recognize the importance of intuition and emotion would be great if you had james c wathey on 
discuss his work on the biological and physiological roots of religious belief frankly i find it astonishing how people 
the new testament and come to these positions but evidently they frequently do but they do so by essentially 
it it is undeniable that the gospel has become a lifestyle preference thing in the west and the us 
particular but reading all the nt and not just palatable sections for americans demolishes the idea i watched to 
halfway if you want primarily to improve your own and physical and emotional lots in this world and not 
bring in sin personal responsibility and selfsacrifice and indeed ridicule and persecution christianity just the thing readily accept on 
merits for you not primarily about you anyway reasonable prosperity rather than greed may be justifiable form the nt 
most americans have little idea how fortunate they are in absolute terms african americans included christianity is based both 
faith in the real world fact of the death and resurrection of christ as god incarnate and crucially on 
hope of the resurrection of the dead for believers it is aimed at preparing for another realm one without 
disingenuity deeply embedded in this present life even in those who imagine they are honest and rational paul answers 
point of worldly pragmatism by saying his and my faith is pitiful if aimed at success in this world 
one corinthians if that is what you want acceptance by harvard academia is a better bet than living for 
certainly in the end god cannot be mocked and his word will be found to have judged your heart 
unerring accuracy i am friendly many indigenous africans and in particular i think of a young black zimbabwean christian 
enough he seems to be quite happy with what seem to me to be excesses of some us preachers 
enjoys their prosperity ime africans do not need coercion into spiritual worldviews they gravitate to them anyway comments are
