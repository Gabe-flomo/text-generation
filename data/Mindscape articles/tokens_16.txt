show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and as 
these words we are in the middle of a protopandemic with the coronavirus the disease that is happening because 
this certainly not an expert in viruses or pandemics or anything like that and this episode is not about 
or pandemics but it is about evolution and this is part of why we get pandemics is because all 
little microbes bless their hearts they keep evolving clever new ways to deal with us even if it hurts 
in doing it and it turns out when you go into the details that we human beings sometimes take 
as learn in this podcast human dna has a certain fraction that is just borrowed wholesale from virus dna 
cases where we encountered a virus and we just combat it we absorbed it or at least absorbed part 
it sc part of the whole question of how transitions happen in evolution when charles darwin first invented the 
of natural selection he had the idea that it was more or less gradual right that there were slow 
minor changes and some of them would catch on develop and grow others would be less successful but we 
see examples of major transitions whether they happen quickly or not is a complicated thing but there are transitions 
the first flight right the first animals that could actually fly and develop wings or the first climbing onto 
on the part of aquatic animals so this has always been a question for darwinian evolution how does that 
how does a fish develop the right organismal abilities to live on and flourish on dry land not teleological 
is not based on goals toward future success so the fish think to itself would like to be able 
get up and get that yummy food up on land let me develop some feet and some lungs and 
ability to do sc so today talking to neil shubin a quite wellknown evolutionary biologist he is a distinguished 
professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the university of chicago very wellknown of course for being one of 
codiscoverers of tiktaalik the fossil that represents a crucially important transitional stage the transitional stage precisely from being a 
swimming in the water to being an amphibian living mostly on land a little fishlike thing that has the 
very primitive versions of feet and hands and the ability to breathe air and so forth so neil has 
evolution of his own in the research that he does mostly from going out there and hunting fossils and 
paleontology and learning about the evolution of life on that macro scale to being in a lab and doing 
biology understanding how changes in dna both the actual coding for proteins but also how the dna we have 
regulated and expressed can lead to these major transitions in evolution i mean what actually happens in the dna 
a fish to turn it into something that can climb about on land sc an extremely exciting field because 
of these things where obviously learned a lot but still a lot left to learn and as we discuss 
the very end of the episode a rapidly changing field in part because we are developing the ability to 
these changes in dna ourselves so what used to be more or less gradual changes in how organisms functioned 
be very very rapid because now we can have teleology we can actually plan what might happen next so 
fun episode neil is a wonderful science communicator the author of a book called your inner fish which tells 
things that are still in your body right now were first developed in the context of when our ancestors 
in fact fish and he has a new book coming out literally tomorrow as this episode is being released 
some assembly required decoding four billion years of life from ancient fossils to dna about these major transitions in 
and how we are learning about them through studying dna so go music sc neil shubin welcome to the 
podcast neil shubin great to be here sc going to be talking about evolution natural selection charles darwin i 
to let everyone know right from the start the official mindscape podcast position is that evolution is real and 
going to be discussing whether or not evolution happened versus creationism or anything like that i hope okay with 
ns yeah i do that in the book either so good sc yeah not why here you can go 
other places for that but given that evolution is real given that darwin was roughly speaking right certainly a 
of work to be done in figuring out exactly how it happened is that a fair way of stating 
ns and good news because that keeps people like me employed and happened recently is had gamechanging technologies both 
the ways we analyze fossils both in molecular biology and computation that really changed things and so many of 
questions that darwin had and many of the ideas he had are still relevant but boy are we learning 
things sc yeah yeah and always one of those things where when you solve one problem you open up 
new problems and multiple new puzzles and i think that people who are not embedded in the scientific process 
feel like just more and more puzzles that you guys are inventing chuckle whereas actually more and more knowledge 
gained at the same time ns yeah sometimes you actually get to ask new kinds of questions more powerful 
in many ways more precise questions maybe more global questions the questions never stop they just change and as 
gain answers we can new questions sc yeah so you have a new book coming out called some assembly 
decoding four billion years of life from ancient fossils to dna congratulations on that ns oh thank you so 
sc and written a couple of other books your sort of break out one was your inner fish about 
discovery i always say tiktaalik but told the wrong pronunciation ns well actually right in some quarters but we 
tiktaalik sc tiktaalik okay ns yeah so if you go to the inuit an inuit word an inuit name 
would be tiktaalik sc oh really tiktaalik ns but tiktaalik is what been saying yeah sc oh definitely going 
stick with the inuit way if okay with you ns definitely chuckle sc so tell that story a little 
but first just to put things in context one of the things that you still want to understand if 
good natural selection evolutionary biologist is the question of missing links and big transitions in evolution i mean the 
is that whenever you find a missing link created two more missing links because you now have one species 
between two other ones but this is a good puzzle for biology is that right ns oh a wonderful 
and in fact the one that drew me into the field and in realizing that how this book came 
was realizing how important those questions are the great transitions in evolution and some of the misconceptions that we 
all of us about those transitions missing links being one of them sc so what sense is there a 
that says the idea of missing links is itself a misconception ns well there should laughter ns as somebody 
has claimed to have found a missing link and other people have purported it that tiktaalik is but the 
is evolution is a hugely branching tree it take a straighton path and when we talk about links which 
are number one found not missing but number two the path of evolution is often very unpredictable it has 
of twists and turns and goes backwards and forwards and not a straight path a linear ladder a hugely 
bush of change that goes in many different directions ns so the missing link concept i mean the part 
it right is link is there are links among species but what underlies that narrative however is the assumption 
evolution acts as a ladder of progress of change of one form inexorably giving rise to another that looks 
of like that looks the same but different there are aspects of that that are true but that linear 
that i think finding as we study fossils and genes as really hold up sc yeah and your book 
does a good job of explaining the messiness of it all which like you say full employment for scientists 
good ns yeah a beautiful messiness the mess is the message and so we can get into that but 
the fun of this you know so sc why people should become physicists instead of biologists way cleaner biology 
way too messy ns yeah a a total mess laughter sc so one of the very most obvious links 
one might want to fill in whether you call it a missing link or not is between fish and 
dwellers or amphibians or whatever and where tiktaalik comes into the story so why you tell us just the 
human story of you and your team discovering that and what it all meant ns well it began as 
describe in the book actually it began in my second year at graduate school i i know what i 
to do for my phd i knew i wanted to study evolution but i thought maybe i want to 
mammals or i know i know and so i took a survey course on evolution and like each week 
a different greatest hits in the history of life you go from one great transition to the next and 
professor showed this beautiful slide of a fish on one end and an amphibian or tetrapod a limbed animal 
the other with an arrow connecting them and then it was like kind of what we knew about that 
from water to land i remember looking at that slide thinking golly i want to work on that problem 
i want to find fossils that do it and so you know with colleagues we set off on a 
quest to find an intermediate between a fish that lives in water and limbed animal tetrapod that lives on 
and we know used the rules of paleontology we invent new methods here ns we were using sort of 
tried and true perspectives of field paleontology which goes as follows in simplified form if you want to find 
key intermediate fossil say a transitional fossil say between say fish and tetrapods or between birds and reptiles or 
and mammals whatever you look for places in the world that have three things you look for places in 
world that have rocks that hold rocks of the right age to answer whatever question interests you so if 
in the fish to limbed animal transition going to be looking at rocks about million years old or so 
for places in the world that have rocks of the right type to hold fossils obviously not every kind 
rock does that and as a geologist you start to learn the catalog of environments and rocks that are 
to preserve the best fossils as much art as science by the way and a lot of induction there 
and then the third part is you look for places in the world that not only have rocks of 
right age or the right type but the rocks that are exposed and accessible it makes total sense right 
want rocks that are buried twelve miles underground or that are in the side of mount everest or in 
politically unviable place a war zone you need accessibility and so those are the filters right so the a 
place sc so the point with that last one being that erosion and plate tectonics etcetera are constantly exposing 
layers and so are you going to go look for the layers which have the kind of rocks that 
want ns correct correct and so you can actually go to geology libraries which is what we did in 
or do it online and you can get aerial photos you can get geological maps that give you the 
of rocks in a border you can dig out papers on the local geology to find out what kind 
rocks are there and you can put all this information together so what we were doing in the looking 
rocks of the right age about three hundred seventyfive million years old and so forth our first gig was 
pennsylvania because my first job was outside was at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia and i grew up 
as well and so i knew the place and i also knew that there is a lot of devonian 
rock in pennsylvania throughout the state ns so it the first part of our hunt was looking at the 
age again million year old rocks in pennsylvania and it turns we have a lot of exposure so we 
on road cuts when penndot pennsylvania department of transportation would come in to build a new road get in 
and look at the rocks and that was amazingly successful it really was we started finding early tetrapods early 
animals we found all kinds of fish it was just a remarkably productive program ns but my colleague in 
ted daeschler who was a student at the time and now a colleague who works on all this stuff 
me we realized we had a problem we were in rocks that were too young to answer the question 
wanted to find a fish with limb with a fin with limb bones inside it that had a head 
a limb of a tetrapod like a flathead not a conical head like a fish that had a neck 
things like that and we finding a lot of that so we were in rocks that were way too 
to answer the question so back to the drawing board and so it turned out one thing led to 
and we settled on a region of rock up in the canadian arctic that extends from about one thousand 
hundred kilometers from melville island in the west to ellesmere island in the east ns and perfect i mean 
three hundred seventyfive million years old rock that was produced in ancient rivers and streams much like the amazon 
today in the canadian arctic by the way that tells you how different how much the changed and then 
that was exposed by ice and water and so forth so we had all our variables maximized at this 
so starting in we began expeditions there sc slightly more exotic than the hills of pennsylvania ns yeah quite 
bit taking a team of six people there are polar bears up there daylight twentyfour hours a day three 
miles from the nearest village which has one hundred seventy people at that eighty north latitude i mean pretty 
and for those reasons it took us a while to be successful a season up there would be about 
weeks and so we started in did four weeks then two thousand did it again and each year we 
a little progress but we never really found what we were looking for until we had found a layer 
lots of fish bones in it and digging this layer never forget this day in my life it was 
july in this layer cracking rocks finding fossil fish nothing be talking about ns but my colleague one of 
colleagues in the pit with me cracked a rock and said neil and i came over and i looked 
it and as soon as i saw that i knew we had found what we had spent six years 
lots of money and lots of sprained ankles looking for and what it was was a snout of a 
clearly had fish bone the texture was classically fish it was clearly the front of a skull but it 
clearly a very flat skull and so early limbed animals have flat heads we were looking for a flatheaded 
so i said a flatheaded fish looking right out at me in the rock laughter so lot of celebration 
so we ended up removing the whole thing it was about four feet long a little over a meter 
then pulled it out and then as we did that we found four more of these things and since 
found about so not at all rare and then we got these things back to the lab and the 
was removed grain by grain and first we saw it had a fin great but then we saw inside 
had a humerus an upper arm bone had a radius and ulna in there it had a wrist it 
even things that that might compare to digits fingers and toes sc things most fish have ns yeah and 
in a fin clearly it had fin rays and this thing clearly had a shoulder that was part fish 
limbed animal it had that sort of setup yet it had scales yet it had fishlike bones in the 
so it was a real mosaic between characteristics of fish and limbed animals and it was an animal that 
lungs and gills had fins with limb bones inside it was exactly what we were looking for and it 
us a lot about how this transition from water to land happened real physical evidence of that and it 
on us that this was when we were working on this fossil initially it was we found it in 
did most of the work in two thousand five and illustrating it there were trials going on where people 
suing to teach intelligent design creationism in schools and here we had on our desks these fossils it was 
the time laughter ns as you can imagine sc presumably they would just say yeah you glued together a 
with a salamander or something like that right ns yeah well but we actually recorded us taking it out 
was and the wonderful thing is that about this example i love using it to teach not only because 
huge part of my life is that we used the tools of evolutionary biology of geology and stratigraphy of 
geology to make a prediction we go randomly to the arctic and we just stay there and we stayed 
for six years we stayed there for a reason is we felt we had a very strong prediction that 
odds were in our favor if we stuck with it long enough that we would be successful and yeah 
what happened sc a predictive science not merely a matter of history ns correct and you can put the 
in your favor by knowing a lot about the evolutionary history of the groups interested in the dating and 
that those fossils first appear and then knowing a lot about the environments that creatures likely lived in once 
do that then you can make your predictions and the toolkit sc and just that you sort of skipped 
one thing which i think is absolutely fascinating so once found the rocks you want to look at then 
go up there for years on end what is the actual process of looking through the rocks for a 
like i can imagine be walking through rocks for a long time and not see any fossils part of 
is just you have a trained eye but probably more to it than that ns well getting a trained 
definitely a couple of things that fit together one is you train your eye and if you were to 
on an expedition with us first get there and think we were magicians be picking up rocks all over 
feet and but after a few days do it yourself that pattern recognition system that we all have kicks 
it takes a few days but you learn it and whenever i go to a new place i have 
learn how to find new fossils each rock kind of rock is different but what we do is you 
up in the morning and we have geological maps we have our aerial photos we have a good knowledge 
what kinds of rocks are exposed everywhere around us so which hills hold which kinds of rocks so we 
in the morning which rocks we want to visit so walk to those and literally follow layers for miles 
for bones that are weathering out on the surface ns and just painstaking you gotta stick to it and 
we find something weathering then if it looks good dig out the layer try to find the layer the 
are coming from and if any good put a whole team on removing the fossils in that layer essentially 
happens and so success but is success what matters here what matters is developing that eye developing a knowledge 
the geology of the rocks working on being really patient sc yeah i think laughter ns be whole days 
weeks where not finding stuff but you got to stay on point and sometimes not easy if the lousy 
stuck in the arctic and you want to get home lots of other psychological things that kick in as 
that you have to think about up there but all those are variables that are related to success sc 
the experiment i have gone to wyoming and montana with your colleague paul sereno digging for dinosaurs and just 
really very good at distinguishing the rocks from anything else ns well i got news for you i was 
good either when i was in graduate school the first expedition i went on was like my first year 
graduate school i was invited to look for fossil mammals which are really small i was an utter disaster 
the point where one of the senior people told me have a future in this kid just stick to 
theoretical chuckle by the way i had never camped before that sc yeah okay ns i was just such 
this all was new but then i decided i wanted to do it and just like anything in sc 
can learn yeah ns make a decision you can learn it exactly sc and i love the fact that 
book that you wrote about this was not just hey we found a transitional organism between fish and amphibians 
the fact that the relics of that transition are still within us today right what it really means to 
our inner fish and a ns oh yeah sc that the transitions are gradual and continuous from very early 
to right now ns correct the conceit of that book you know that fossil was just a way point 
really once you start to look at anatomy and development and molecular biology what you start to see is 
of years of artifacts of billions of years of history inside our own bodies and you see that in 
genome you see that in ourselves you see that in our tissues our organs you look at our skulls 
and so forth we can see layer after layer of evolutionary history inside of us so that was the 
that i told in inner fish and that was a really an extension of a lot of the teaching 
did because at the time i was at the time we discovered tiktaalik i was teaching human anatomy to 
students here in the university of chicago medical school it enabled me to connect the dots in the way 
probably have done in the same way previously sc i think that hiccups were my favorite example right can 
explain why we have hiccups ns yeah well we have hiccups basically a spasm of the phrenic nerve one 
that came out from some folks in canada a few years ago was the idea that that response that 
a very calibrated stereotypical response of nerves firing and muscles firing and in consequence that a pattern inside our 
nervous system that causes that pattern to occur that pattern occurs naturally elsewhere in the wild in one place 
we see it is in frogs and tadpoles which use a form of a hiccup and that neural response 
actually breathe with water and so what see is these antecedents that we see in other animals for things 
we think are distinctively human when in reality not sc yeah so we can get into exactly sort of 
purpose i think the main theme call it that of this podcast which is this is that tiktaalik does 
a major transition from one way of life to another can you just say a little bit for people 
know anything what was its motivation for climbing up onto land and how did that really work it seems 
something that if just under water and have a happy life there that climbing up to a different poisonous 
is not your first idea ns well it helps to compare water and land probably not one reason there 
probably many but if you look in the devonian and what lived in the water at that time you 
big fish you had small fish but pretty much all of them were carnivores they were all predators so 
was a fisheatfish world and by the way you have wanted to swim in these devonian streams there were 
predators filling the crocodile kinda niche giant predators with teeth the size of railroad spikes so yeah it was 
very predator and competitorintense world in the water but if you look at land at that time there are 
on land there are invertebrates there are food sources on land there are a few competitors and certainly no 
so any trait that would allow a creature to avoid the water get away from the predators and the 
into the mudflats and to land would probably be favored because there was a world of opportunity with foodstuffs 
land without competitors or predators ns there are probably lots of other reasons as well things like tiktaalik and 
cousins in the devonian were not fully landliving they were living in the shallows and the mudflats so a 
between these environments as well so lots of reasons but there are lots of good reasons to get out 
the water you could think about it if a fisheatfish world lots of strategies you can get big big 
eat little fish you can get armor which a lot of fish do or you can get out of 
way get out of there chuckle i think our distant ancestors were the ones who got out of there 
but not lamarckian you as a fish say a lot of yummy food up there on land i think 
will turn my fins into right there have to be all of these little transitions ns no exactly right 
really good point not that actually natural selection and with some assembly required the new book really is about 
showing how that happens so when you think about the watertoland transition it actually exemplifies other great transitions as 
in showing one really important thing that is pretty much every trait that we associate with one of the 
revolutions in the history of life say limbs or arms and the invasion of land lungs and the invasion 
land feathers and the origin of flight walking on two legs and the origin of humanity pretty much every 
that we associate with a revolution is not associated with that revolution it came about millions of years before 
right ns and the big thing one of the quotes that leads off the book is one of my 
ones from lillian hellman who lived a fairly hard life and she said of course ever begins when you 
it that is a great motto for thinking about evolutionary change nothing begins it always begins well before sc 
repurposing something else right ns repurposing repurposing and then modifying and then repurposing again coopting duplicating merging all these 
tinkering in some very profound ways and we get to see glimpses of that tinkering in the fossil record 
could see the pathway it took but when we look at genes and we look at development we look 
molecular biology we begin to see the mechanisms behind that kind of tinkering and repurposing which is really fabulous 
sc so i can imagine it might have been much harder for that fish to climb up onto land 
it have fins in the first place or flippers flippers is that what you are saying ns yeah it 
a sort of a flipperlike limb it basically had a shoulder it had an elbow and it had a 
and it had part of the fin the terminal end of the fin that could serve as a palm 
is a fish that can do a pushup that can even walk in funny ways and by the way 
fish also had lungs so you can imagine that these fish with all this gear living in water walking 
the bottom of the water maybe in the mudflats it was already set up to jump into land when 
need happened and to refine those structures and to modify them and repurpose them in new ways sc i 
maybe to the people who are not experts the fact that it had lungs is even more impressive and 
than the fact that it could develop feet because as long as you have flippers you can imagine morphing 
into feet but if you breathe through gills why do you also have lungs ns yeah great and so 
is actually something that was discovered in the known this forever yet if you talk to people they always 
lungs arose of course related to living on no not they originally came about in creatures living in water 
known that since expeditions to egypt in the early and ever since and what people started to do is 
discovered in dissecting new kinds of fish that they saw in africa or in south america or in australia 
found that some fish have lungs real lungs that are exactly like ours in many ways and in fact 
you look at a lot of fish a lot of fish have a air sac that is connected to 
gut tube or related to the gut tube in development and in some of those fish that sac becomes 
in others that sac becomes a swim bladder which they use for buoyancy ns so this air sac presence 
fish is really ancient and in fact an air sac that functions as a lung is ancient still so 
is it doing well in critter in fish that have lungs they have both gills and lungs and more 
than not using their gills sitting in water just like any good old fish and breathing right but the 
concentration in water can vary a lot it can vary a lot from month to month season to season 
so forth and so there are times when the oxygen content of water is not sufficient to support an 
and what do is in those cases go to the surface and actually gulp air into their lungs and 
go back down ns and so lungs are sort of an accessory organ that allow fish to exploit water 
has variable oxygen concentrations throughout the year and there are lots of strategies that fish have to do this 
have lungs and others breathe through their skin still others will vascularize parts of their mouth and use that 
a respiratory organ so lots of little different indentions that happen in evolution to allow fish to breathe air 
breathing in fish is very very common but lungs are a very ancient one and so our distant relatives 
originally took the first steps to walk on land they need to involve lungs they already existed sc is 
safe to say that the lungs always came from swim bladders or air sacs or something like that was 
some prior purpose that it developed ns yeah safe to say that the lungs actually originally rose as a 
as an outpocket of the gut tube so during development of the tube that forms the gut it develops 
and then it outpockets forms an outpouch and in some fish that pouch becomes lungs in others it becomes 
bladders so related developmentally but the whole thing is the common developmental process that gives rise to both and 
much all fish have one or the other sc yeah good and this is a good segue thank you 
doing my work there because one of the lessons of your book is that one of the major sort 
resources for doing this repurposing is tinkering with our development right ns right sc this famous but slightly exaggerated 
that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny tell us that story a little bit and maybe we can work salamanders in there 
some point because the salamander stuff was just amazing ns yeah really cool so ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny a lot 
us learned it in high school i did i learned it in junior high and it was like a 
jingle all sing in like the third week of evolution or something like that laughter ns and as most 
know this notion that an older notion that claims that during the course of development going from egg to 
through the different stages of embryology organisms creatures would track their evolutionary history so if you look at a 
it would go through a fish stage an amphibian stage a reptile stage and so forth and this was 
after darwin wrote the origin of species ernst haeckel a great german biologist really promulgated this theory pushed it 
and there are other versions of recapitulation as well there was one that actually came out before darwin and 
basically said that creatures look most similar as embryos they tend to get look very different as adults actually 
much more modern concept even though the older one in many ways anyway these were very foundational concepts it 
out that i think biology is a world of exceptions particularly for ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny and there are so 
exceptions sc you should probably tell us what ontogeny and phylogeny are ns yeah sorry about that so ontogeny 
another word for development phylogeny is another word for evolutionary history so development tracks evolutionary history what ontogeny recapitulates 
basically means in english development tracks evolutionary history and so but that was a very dominant theory worldview for 
period of time it turns out to be wrong though there are cases where it does that so there 
some cases where we do see in individual traits that the development will track evolutionary history but certainly not 
as a law of nature like haeckel and his contemporaries proposed sc so it does seem to be true 
in the embryos etcetera of various species you see features that are in common with very very different species 
because of our common ancestry ns correct so we see a ton of that in fact we see so 
common in development and when you look at an early embryo of a fish and a human find an 
number of similarities in the skull bones in the digestive system in the expiratory system and so forth but 
like we track evolutionary history just that we begin from a common stage of development more or less or 
early stages of development tend to be much more similar is kind of the idea there but the relationship 
development embryology to evolution has long been a source of fascination for scientists in my field really the embryo 
always held this special place because you think about it here i am studying evolutionary history and looking at 
transformations in the history of life but what happens in development great transformations happen every hour laughter ns you 
you know right organs appear out you begin as a single cell then the cell doubles and doubles and 
and doubles and eventually you get germ layers these different layers that form different tissues of the body and 
the heart emerges and the central nervous system emerges these things emerge over time and part of the fascination 
i felt as a graduate student when looking at an embryo looking at an organism being built a really 
thing and when we can compare the embryos of different creatures say a fish and a mammal you begin 
see you can begin to explain the differences between them by differences in the way built right and a 
powerful way to look at evolution sc which reminds me i wanted to ask a little bit more about 
history of darwin i know this is out of order but okay darwin correctly gets credit for natural selection 
but there were ideas floating around that species evolved in some very generalized sense without necessarily all the mechanisms 
random mutation and natural selection right ns oh correct the notions of evolution were around before darwin you mentioned 
he was before darwin own grandfather erasmus darwin had a notion of evolution and in fact when darwin was 
on his theory of evolution other people were coming up with it at the same time alfred russel wallace 
a few other people independently so yeah the idea has been out there and in fact many of the 
we use in an evolutionary concept originally came about before darwin so this notion about embryos being very similar 
similar to one another than adults that was something that was predarwinian and in a lot of concepts sc 
what i wanted to get at just amazing to me so they already that idea even ns oh yeah 
they were really trying to explain diversity someone said my new book is trying to explain diversity how do 
know how do we explain and understand the diversity of life we see on our planet right well people 
been after that for a long time before darwin just they using natural selection as a mechanism they saw 
work of a creator but they were looking for order and rules underneath diversity that explained it and a 
of those ideas that they developed in the predarwinian context actually apply very well in the evolutionary one sc 
anyone have the idea that god did it and it was designed but plan involved species changing over time 
something simple to the incredible diversity we see today ns not aware of that particular view one of the 
for some listener probably would know it i however one of the challenges for that was to accept that 
to accept that species are imperfect and they go extinct and the concept of extinction was a relatively new 
in biology believe it or not it has its own history but it really until soon before darwin that 
really accepted the reality of extinction so if you have extinction and if species are perfect then hard to 
a notion of evolution and so the idea of extinction was itself the understanding of extinction was really essential 
darwin and other and other perspectives on evolution as well sc so there was still some picture that nature 
a perfect kind of setup and there was no reason for it to change over time and that was 
of the cultural change that darwin rode in on ns correct sc yeah ns and that was the dominant 
view but these folks then many of them who make it into the book were really looking for order 
diversity rules and diversity what explains why a fish looks the way it does and a human and they 
trying to do it in a world where these species are fixed and not changing but in doing that 
devised tools conceptual tools that we use today and one of them is this notion called homology where again 
has predarwinian roots but it translated very well for darwin the idea that you can compare similar structures in 
species that you can compare a vertebra from a fish to a reptile to a bird to a human 
you can compare the same vertebra among these different things that was a notion that came up in the 
world but yet darwin basically put a a material spin on it basically saying the reason why he can 
that is because these things share an evolutionary history together sc got it good so this is an appropriate 
to bring in the salamanders i think this is just a wonderful example of there is a connection between 
and evolution ns yeah salamanders i love salamanders so did part of my phd thesis on salamanders i just 
them and then i did my postdoc on them i grow up as a kid who loved herps reptiles 
amphibians and stuff but as a graduate student i just fell in love with these little creatures and they 
have such a history so one of my favorite stories is auguste duméril who was a professor at the 
of the natural history in paris he and his dad were experts academician experts on reptiles and amphibians and 
is a time of discovery sort of in the midlate right after darwin about one thousand eight hundred sixtyfour 
so and so duméril would get shipments of critters from expeditions around the world that folks found and want 
to figure it out ns well one day he gets a box with i think six salamanders inside and 
are from mexico and he looks in the box and the folks sent it to him because darwin just 
his theory and these salamanders that he was sent they had an aquatic tail big fleshy lobe tail they 
external gills they were fully aquatic and they sent them to duméril thinking a living missing right this is 
of like a creature that maybe will tell us something about how fish evolved to walk on land so 
did they know about salamanders at all in europe at the time ns yes they did yeah there are 
salamanders so they knew quite a bit about them just their local species but this from mexico was weird 
it this is a giant adult full adult with all these aquatic features so like this is so he 
them in his menagerie and salamanders are easy to care for you can actually leave them alone for long 
of time and exactly what he did and he came back after a period of time and he went 
to his box and he looked in his box and he saw his fully adult salamanders that were aquatic 
external gills but then there was a whole another type of salamander there fully adult reproducing big with no 
gills a fully terrestrial body no aquatic lobey tail no external gills he looked at it and was like 
two different genera okay something happened in that sc not just species yeah ns yeah like this was a 
box well he was a scientist he follow the magic reasoning so he said what is going on here 
amazing almost like he put gorillas in the cage came back and found chimps and gorillas the next year 
was like that kind of thing so he did his homework and he started to study their embryology and 
found that this difference is really a simple shift of development and it showed how a simple shift of 
can bring about changes across the entire animal so what happened during the normal life cycle of one of 
salamanders they have an egg they hatch from the egg they swim around in water with external gills and 
tails that are like a fin and then at some point in their life they swim around as aquatic 
right and then they get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and then eventually at some point in 
life they undergo metamorphosis and metamorphosis hormone is triggered thyroid hormone and they lose the external gills the tail 
the head changes all that good stuff ns and what duméril realized as well as some other people at 
time was what happened in his box is the salamanders the aquatic salamanders reproduced but their offspring underwent metamorphosis 
those other ones and so there was the trick there is whether you undergo metamorphosis or not which can 
triggered by external cues in these species so really remarkable he was able to and this was a huge 
that a subtle change in development maybe just changing thyroid hormone and metamorphosis can have changes across the body 
two animals can look entirely different as a result of that ns so that work was really foundational in 
sense that what it did is it turned people on to thinking about what kinds of subtle changes in 
can bring about some of these huge changes in the history of life that darwin was talking and it 
out one simple way is just to change the timing of developmental events extend development stop it early that 
of stuff sc yeah amazing to me because just be super clear that other form that did undergo the 
is completely landbased it look like it has any aquatic paraphernalia at all is that correct ns right correct 
so i mean the body looks totally different right and the way it feeds is totally different the whole 
and a really just a subtle change in the level of hormone at one time of development and so 
and also the fact that it can just get stuck in that premetamorphosis stage and still flourish a perfectly 
salamander but an aquatic salamander ns oh yeah and by the way it really is full of the critters 
in water sc yeah ns so and think about that here the whole waterland transition happens in one animal 
the course of its life sc yes an easy ns why interesting right and here i go study fossils 
look at this guy so but really amazing because then the hunt is on well what kind of changes 
development can bring about the evolutionary changes we see sc yeah ns and again these changes of timing developmental 
now we know a lot of molecular changes and how genes are controlled turned on and off during development 
such a powerful and powerfully important tradition in my field of biology this relationship between development and evolution its 
subfield now sc yeah but already now mentioned something that is crucial to this story as good as the 
was about figuring out all sorts of weird things about animals these days we have information about dna and 
that is really changing the whole way we think about the story ns correct and so the predicate for 
this were people like duméril who were studying the embryos who were studying the bodies but the game changer 
us is really the advent of molecular biology and its power to explain and it gives us a whole 
set of tools to approach these classic questions and some of the biggest discoveries well again they have predicates 
well but the and were quite a remarkable time where molecular tools were getting powerful enough and cheap enough 
could be applied to a number of different species that we began to see the relationships between genes and 
in the embryo how genes control that development and how changes to genes can bring about changes to development 
ultimately changes to evolution so that has been incredibly important and incredibly powerful and some of those initial discoveries 
game changers for me in my own growth as a scientist i had trained to be a paleontologist and 
was studying how to find fossils the techniques that led to the discovery of tiktaalik right ns but i 
back in the there were a bunch of papers that were being published and i was made aware of 
by a fellow graduate student and showing that we were seeing in flies genes that build the bodies of 
animals genes that control why a wing is in one part of the body and an antenna is in 
part of the body and that was exciting enough but what was even more exciting was later papers showing 
these genes present only in flies but versions of these same genes are present in salamanders frogs worms mice 
people that a common toolkit versions of the same genes are doing similar things in many different creatures and 
me that was glimmers of a new biology and for a lot of people it was glimmers of a 
biology in the and so when i decided to add the molecular biology toolkit to my own repertoire as 
scientist sc and we think that convergent evolution we think this is just a set of genes that have 
with us a long time ns oh my gosh yeah these are ancient genes and these ancient genes the 
but they evolved in the distant past of animal life and then there have been rounds of where these 
have been duplicated modified repurposed just like structures genes are repurposed so rules we see for the evolution of 
they apply very well to the tinkering the repurposing the cooption the duplication all these things that we see 
the evolution of structures they happen at the level of genes so these genes are ancient but also witnessed 
lot of changes flies have only one set of these genes we have four so duplicated over time gained 
functions and more complexity over time that kind of thing sc sure that the and were great but i 
to skip over all the really charming early technologies that were there for thinking and measuring genes and their 
and so forth yeah i guess let you pick your favorite stories from the book but the idea of 
little molecules in a gel and pulling them across with an electromagnetic field to see how heavy they were 
think that these days spoiled and people probably think just look at the dna and figure out what it 
they have that ability back then in the say ns no one of my favorite stories is sumo ono 
was a researcher at the city of hope california and he was interested in genetics hugely interested in genetics 
he loved horses and he found he that only so much you can train horses he said if a 
is no good no good all about the genes so because of that love of horses and his knowledge 
them he decided to study genes and so he designed one the greatest techniques so he looked at chromosomes 
chromosomes sit in the nucleus and chromosomes are bundles of dna and he wanted to see can he characterize 
among species by looking at differences of their chromosomes this is in the and and he have much technology 
his fingertips what he had was a microscope and he had a camera and he could develop pictures with 
camera ns so what he did was he took pictures of different species he took salamanders he took rhinos 
took people he would just get cells right cell samples from zoos and he would look at the nuclei 
look at the chromosomes in the nuclei so take pictures of all these things and what he did was 
technology possible he took pictures of the chromosomes printed out the pictures cut them out and weighed them so 
would basically take pictures of the chromosomes of a salamander cut them out and weigh them and then take 
of the chromosomes of a human cut them out and weigh them and he used those weights as proxy 
the amount of dna in the cell okay sc better make sure the zoom was the same in both 
right ns yeah chuckle well what he found was that the salamanders have ten times more genes chromosomal stuff 
humans and he was one of the first persons using this lowtech technique to show that the amount of 
material in the nucleus and what we know now is the amount of dna in the genome is unrelated 
the complexity of the organism sc yeah i was going to say not possible because we way more superior 
these little salamanders how come they have so much more genetic laughter ns well i know about superior they 
flip their tongue in a millisecond some of these things so pretty superior depends how you measure it but 
much more complicated in a lot of ways cognitively and so forth and yeah he found that unrelated to 
amount of genetic material in the cell so he was one of the first people to show that the 
of genetic material in a cell is unrelated to a complexity he looked at plants like lilies they have 
enormous amount of that yeah so that was a huge surprise ns and then he was able to look 
those chromosomes because you can add dye to the nucleus and you could begin to see the chromosomes with 
stripes on them he began to see when he looked in detail at the stripes it looked like whole 
of stripes were just repeated and duplicated like somebody took a xerox machine to the chromosome of a salamander 
just duplicated whole chunks of it so he came up with a notion of with all this low technology 
that the idea was that perhaps one of the major sources of innovation for new genetic material in evolution 
gene duplication is duplicating old genes so a great way of coopting and repurposing and so that turns out 
be a very profound discovery the more we look at gene sequences we can now sequence genes in an 
ns we begin to see just how important that is that there are whole gene families which might contain 
of genes all related to each other by history rounds of duplication in their history we see that in 
over and over again i just love that story because a person who had a great idea found a 
lowtech way to test it and opened up a whole new field of research sc yeah no it gives 
for the ingenuity of scientists and interesting to speculate about how be equally ingenious in the years to come 
one hopes sc but good so get down to brass tacks about the genes and how they work so 
assume we know the basic story but an important part of the story that you tell in some assembly 
is that of course we have that is to say we have segments of our dna the code for 
and then the proteins go and do useful things in our body but then other parts of the dna 
are regulating when the genes are switched on and switched off and also junk dna how does all that 
together and how does it play into the story of major transitions ns yeah okay just to set the 
dna sits in the nucleus of all of our cells and in each cell about six so if you 
a strand of dna if you would unwind it about six feet long sitting inside the nucleus packed super 
think about that we have about four trillion cells if you put all our dna endtoend of all our 
stretched it out and laid endtoend it would go almost to pluto think about just how much genetic material 
in our bodies and how tightly packed it is in each cell kind of mindblowing now when we think 
dna the dna is a sequence of bases so a gene sequence sits in a double helix and packed 
tightly ns a part of the dna that contains the information to make a protein the protein coding part 
a whole other parts of this that does other things some of which still grappling with but to give 
a little perspective the gene part of our genome that part that makes proteins is only of our genome 
genes only make up about of our genome so the protein coding part the part that contains the information 
make the proteins is just a tiny fraction of the genome the rest of it kinda controls the activity 
those things sc is that completely true or it is also true that some of it is just kind 
wasted space ns it could be yeah it could be wasted space or it could be space we know 
function yet see a lot of the activity of dna is related to its dynamism how it opens and 
forms loops in on itself and so those space or regions could have lots of importance in terms of 
overall geometry of the dna but the individual sequence might not matter as much who knows sc okay interesting 
but still a bit of a mystery still quite a mystery for us and boy a lot of ink 
on debates around that too sc yeah ns you think about it this way if you the cells in 
body pretty much all have the same dna inside them different is making different proteins so the cells in 
retina of our eye compared to the cells in the skin of our fingertip they have the same dna 
them but the dna in the retina cells is making proteins that builds and keeps a retina functioning the 
inside the tip of our finger have the same dna but the genes that are active are the ones 
the skin tissues the proteins that give skin tissue its properties so different here is which genes are turned 
and off in each kind of cell in each kind of tissue so not the dna per se utterly 
controlling their activity ns people have really since the say the midlate really focused on that what are these 
switches what controls whether a gene is turned on and off and once we know that is that a 
player in evolutionary change and it turns out yes yes and yes understanding these switches is so important not 
to understand what makes issues different in health and disease but also to understand evolution to say well not 
you have a new protein coding gene you have the same gene just turning it on and off in 
places and different times in development so it all comes back to development and what these genes are doing 
development and if turning on genes and turning them off in different times and places you can make really 
changes sc is it possible to explain to us at the molecular biology level how the information encoded in 
set of the dna actually does turn on and off the other sets of dna ns yeah so you 
the protein coding gene and lying next to it is usually a little sequence that when something attaches to 
sequence some very important things attach to that sequence turn the gene on or turn it off depending on 
the nature of that little section is so it all comes down to molecular keys that come in so 
one part of the genome might fold over to touch that switch and if it does that it activates 
gene there are lots of little triggers that would control these things but you have to think about this 
a very dynamic chemical landscape where proteins and other factors are being made ns and as they do that 
to these different switch sequences in the genome which then control the activity of the gene threedimensional structure you 
the genome opening and closing so when the genome is closed not making proteins so open up in areas 
proteins are made so first it has to open up so that dynamism at the level of the genome 
certain sections have to come in and touch these switches actually connect to them to activate the genes so 
whole rube goldberg kind of set of activities that have to happen for a gene to turn on sc 
the threedimensional structure differ from one kind of cell to the other ns it can yeah very much so 
fact a very active field of research right now in molecular biology is understanding these threedimensional changes really gotten 
big is is now we can see the genome we could begin to map it we begin to see 
at work and what surprises everybody is just how utterly dynamic it is and how very important this threedimensional 
really is ns and lots of mysteries here we know a lot we understand filled with puzzles but one 
we do understand is just how these changes can affect evolution and that is pretty clear that is if 
change a switch going to change the ability to make a be able to make some new things in 
a new tissue a new protein and so forth sc and that fits in with the connection with development 
obviously development is all about deciding which kind of cell going to be and where going to fit in 
therefore what kind of what parts of my dna are going to be useful ns right and basically if 
think about the genome of an organism basically forming a recipe for a development changing the ingredients you can 
the genes you can change the process which is these switches and what you do is subtle changes to 
things and then the embryo can have large consequences to anatomy to evolutionary history just like we saw with 
and so what we can now do is look at that at the genetic level sc so does this 
explain some features of major transitions does it make it easier to understand how major transitions can happen once 
understand this picture of certain coding areas of the dna and other regulatory or expressive regions of the dna 
oh very much so it can show for and kind of getting back to one of the themes we 
about earlier with the fossil record is that you really have to often invent whole new things to have 
transitions happen a lot of great transitions might not involve as much new genes as it would involve using 
genes in new ways so using genes that exist but changing when and where active ns so again like 
raw material for these transitions exists before the transitions themselves you have the genes just using them in new 
part of it there are cases where lots of new genes come about but using old genes in new 
turns out to be a very profound part of these great transitions we see that over and over again 
the other thing that is getting renewed attention which is really fascinating and we see this over and over 
we see this in the origin of new biological inventions but we also see it in the human technological 
is that one thing very common is multiples that is see the same call it evolutionary invention appear independently 
different species at the same time that is the same solution to a problem appears independently in different creatures 
are not directly related to one another so it means happened separately ns and one of the reasons why 
may happen is if organisms if creatures have the same set of genes functioning in the same ways it 
similar outcomes more likely right so this notion that you could have parallel evolution or independent evolution of the 
structure is something gaining renewed intention from the molecular realm because if organisms have similar genes and using those 
in similar ways then they might produce the same kinds of mutations independently that natural selection can work on 
not random sc because building on some sort of common starting point not just like you say not just 
choosing crazy things ns right if you have a recipe to make cupcakes only certain ways you can change 
recipe and have it still be recognizably cupcakes so yeah and you hit upon the if different people are 
cupcakes with the same recipe and playing with it in different ways they may come up with the same 
of cupcakes independently sc so this helps explain certain examples of convergent evolution ns it does very much so 
evolution can happen for lots of reasons so first is and a very common reason is common adaptive solution 
creatures are going to fly going to need some sort of wing right and you see that over and 
again and you see white color patterns appearing independently in polar animals that kind of stuff but the other 
why these sorts of that pattern may happen is again common recipes common genes that sort of common recipes 
build bodies common genes that sort of thing sc and does it help explain this puzzle always there in 
what i think of as the statistical mechanics of mutations like most mutations are presumably really bad chuckle ns 
most are not so good but take many beneficial ones to really take off so a beneficial mutation can 
traction very very readily but we talk about mutation being random really not random right only random with respect 
predicting the future just because a creature may need to walk on land in one hundred million years mean 
to come up with mutations to do that so not random with respect to the needs of the organism 
the future ns but i mean random with respect excuse me random with respect to that but not random 
respect to everything else certain mutations are more common than others based on what happens in the genome certain 
are more likely to be beneficial than others based on what happens in the genome and in development yeah 
when we talk about random it has to be very specific about it random in respect to predicting the 
not random sc well you talk in the book about the idea of hopeful monsters and how they kind 
got you in trouble as a graduate student if i read that correctly ns yeah it got into trouble 
ernst mayr in a very big way yeah he so i used to have tea so one of the 
gigs of my graduate student life i know how this happened i was not a great graduate student but 
took a shine to me ernst mayr this great eminence and the new synthesis of evolutionary biology he was 
huge eminence he was about in his at the time and had a lot of history and he loved 
of science and philosophy of science and he was there during one of the pivotal times in our field 
for some reason took a shine to me ns he used to invite me for thursday teas up into 
office on the fifth floor of the museum of comparative zoology at harvard and i made the pilgrimage there 
thursday and i was up in the bird collection it smelled like mothballs and there was this old creaky 
and mayr would sit in his chair and just wax about great people in the field and then he 
encouraged me to come with a book a paper a question to stimulate it so i came one day 
this book called the material basis of evolution which was a recent reprint it had an introduction by steve 
that just came out a couple of weeks before a month before and i brought it up to mayr 
see what at this new thing what do you think of ns and he just turned beet red and 
me this glare like going to eviscerate he went to his filing cabinet came back with his papers he 
wrote animal species and evolution in response to page ninetyfive of this piece of and he threw it down 
me this yellow reprint by goldschmidt which laid out the theory that you can have major evolutionary transitions in 
step in one mutation socalled macro mutations now i knew goldschmidt was a bit of a whipping boy at 
time but i wanted to talk to mayr about what he thought about it that kind of thing oh 
yeah i was it was something else so idea the one that got me so in trouble with by 
way the teas did continue think yeah sc it was a famously contentious place harvard evolutionary biology right ns 
sorry sc harvard evolutionary biology seems like a famously contentious place there were big personalities ns it was yeah 
that time yeah you had eo wilson and steve gould at the time richard lewontin mayr yeah so i 
to navigate that a little bit anyway so i did so pretty much unscathed anyway so the idea was 
goldschmidt proposed he studied development and he studied genes he said look subtle changes in development can yield big 
so hey the first bird hatched out of a reptile egg he said basically one mutation one set of 
you got a bird out of a reptile and that was not wellreceived for good reason there were a 
of reasons why that theory was bound to fail but reappeared in different ways over the years but it 
is not a very viable theory that despite the fact that you can find mutations that will do big 
to the animals it just turns out that those big mutations are almost exclusively lethal really the small mutations 
are most likely to be beneficial so the accumulation of these sc so sorry that is the current way 
thinking that in fact it is the accumulation of tiny things that is much more driving the engine of 
ns yeah but that accumulation can happen pretty quickly and over geological timescales it does the geological timescales i 
with are in the millions hundreds of thousands to millions to tens of millions of years talking accumulation of 
mutations can happen much much much faster than that particularly knowing ways the genome can change sc well i 
going to ask this about the issue of missing links when begun such a transition no teleology not aiming 
some target but once sort of been able to enter a slightly different ecological niche is it true that 
the rate of evolution is faster for species like you than those that are happily in their equilibrium and 
there are fewer records of those in the fossils ns oh a interesting point there are cases where creatures 
a new zone like ecological zone and the evolutionary rate takes off but there are other cases where a 
fuse where something happens and that diversification the explosive diversification happen till much later and we really know why 
happens a bit of a puzzle why you might have that yeah so still very much an open question 
okay i always like to give the undergrads and graduate students out there in the audience problems to work 
so that always good to find the open questions ns oh we got lots of those sc yeah exactly 
what it makes it fun definitely sc and so you already mentioned this i think very briefly but link 
in back in here now that talking about the transitions at the molecular level the idea of genes jumping 
one animal to another and being borrowed like you tell the stories of how viruses virus genes got embedded 
other genes i think this is something obviously that is not part of the classic story of molecular biology 
evolution ns no amazing so when you look at a human genome sequence we have sequenced we could sequence 
now pretty quickly right when you look at a gene sequence what you find is in humans about almost 
of our genome of our entire genome are defunct viruses viral sequences that no longer function but there like 
fossil graveyard a graveyard of ancient viruses that attacked our genome became part of our genome but then got 
out sc every time i talk to a biologist very important that they creep out the audience at some 
or another and ns oh my goal here i mean my goal is to creep everybody out and think 
it it gets even creepier still when you think that okay only of our genomes are our genes but 
like defunct viruses sc yeah ns but also something else really amazing about this so viruses are as we 
which is very relevant in world viruses we live in a balance with viruses right continually infecting us and 
internal mechanisms whether our immune system or our genome are trying to knock them out are trying to disable 
but something else happening as well and this is something pretty new and it begins a researcher who i 
about in a book jason shepherd at the university of utah a neurobiologist not interested in viruses an md 
he studied his microbiology but interested in memory and his research in memory led him to a gene called 
arc arc is a gene that is involved in memory and people mutations in that are associated with dementia 
mutations in arc and mice mean that they lose their memories they can do a maze but the next 
they forget their solution ns and so studying arc his thing because he cares about neurodegenerative diseases in memory 
studying arc and studying when you study a gene going to study its protein so he looks at the 
that arc made and he pops it under a microscope after some effort it turns out he saw these 
these spherules and like looking at them thinking seen these spherules in his microbiology class in medical school the 
that look like the virus hiv the virus that causes aids he says a minute this looks more like 
virus than a memory so he runs down to the next building to talk to people aids experts he 
them what is on the slides says this for these aids experts look at the hiv experts look at 
slide and they say hiv the they just its arc the memory gene in and like sc do not 
biologists bearing gifts chuckle ns yeah so what happens is what jason shepherd showed in his lab and some 
as well is that what arc is is an ancient virus that invaded a distant ancestor of people and 
virus instead of being knocked out by the genome it was domesticated it was repurposed it was like you 
a new job no longer going to infect us going to make a protein going to be used in 
relevant here is that capsule that is made by hiv and arc helps the information the the capsules made 
protect the genetic information of the virus as it goes from cell to cell so it makes hiv very 
in going from cell to cell but exactly what makes the arc gene effective in making memories it goes 
neuron to neuron so this virus was put to work was repurposed if you will by our distant ancestor 
genome of our distant ancestors just how we know but it was to play a role in memory and 
that in all kinds of other genes too and genes that make the placenta the proteins that make the 
some of those genes were originally viruses that invaded the genome so it turns sc all about repurposing all 
ever does ns repurpose yeah either take something from something else and repurpose it or repurpose your own genome 
mergers and acquisitions claiming things as well as your own sc yeah ns and so a real wild world 
these viruses are not only threats but sources of genetic information genetic novelty they are sources of new genetic 
that occasionally have made a very big difference in our evolutionary history and one thing that within the last 
has become under much clearer focus and pretty really remarkable sc and we should probably distinguish because probably many 
have heard the story that you relate in the book about lynn margulis and the mitochondria and so forth 
sort of we absorbed little tiny organisms and made them part of ourselves but mitochondria have separate dna this 
talking about now is actually sticking segments of virus dna into our dna strands right ns yeah so what 
virus does right there are lots of different kinds of viruses and many different ways that this happens but 
a virus will enter and then it goes into the genome of its host and then commandeers the genome 
make more copies of itself like the ultimate parasite it goes in there makes copies of itself takes it 
takes over the machinery makes more copies of itself and there it goes so what happens is sometimes the 
can take over the virus or knock off the virus but also take it over to do new things 
what seeing in some of these cases so the viruses can be the source of genetic novelty right new 
as well yeah pretty amazing sc and i know of how much you followed the controversies over at what 
do we stop calling this darwinian evolution obviously darwin said a lot of true things and then there is 
new synthesis with genetics and so forth but the idea that we simply do sexual reproduction and some of 
dna base pairs get mutated but otherwise we just hand them on is way oversimplified and so at what 
do we call it a new theory versus just little tweaks on the old theory ns yeah hard to 
so you think about when darwin did though darwin the origin of species the first edition was there was 
knowledge of genetics whatsoever sc yeah ns okay we know anything mendel come till much later let alone a 
of dna yet that theory he proposed before genetics make sense under the kind of inheritance that they thought 
sc yeah ns so in fact some of the most trenchant criticisms of darwin were about that and how 
without there was no knowledge of genetics was no knowledge of heredity it was really hard to think about 
these changes can be sustained over time though he did use artificial selection or artificial breeding experiments as well 
his argument but you know a good point we have moved far beyond but staying very much in the 
of darwin natural selection is still the major mechanism of evolution common descent is still the major pattern we 
in the history of life albeit with some exceptions where you have information being traded among species when we 
about darwin really talking about not just a body a theory but a profound shift ns the darwinian revolution 
a profound shift in the way we see the natural world how it came about and our relationship to 
so when we think about darwinian biology i kind of refer to it in those ways in terms of 
fruits of the darwinian revolution yeah yes and no still using some of ideas one of the main ideas 
the book is actually a darwinian one the idea of repurposing the idea that structures arise in one form 
and then they change function later on but just amazing to me i read the book i did a 
dive back into several of the editions of darwin different editions in preparation for writing some assembly required and 
was struck by so many things i was struck by what a great way he was able to marshal 
how he used it what a great writer he was not only in producing evidence but some of his 
just really beautiful i just would sit there and read it over and over again it was just amazing 
just what a remarkably talented human being sc yeah lucky because of that because not all scientists are like 
but he did have the ideas and was able to convey them in an especially compelling poetic way so 
ns yeah so beautiful it really is and at every level at the intellectual level as well as the 
one sc yeah alright so i think that able to get some payoff here so all of this understanding 
genes and expression and regulation and so forth tell us how this explains how fish can develop hands laughter 
well my lab works on that and so you know in the summer we go out to find fossils 
the rest of the year working on the dna of extant fish so working on mice people were able 
identify a series of genes and regulatory elements elements that control the activity of those genes that are deeply 
in making wrists and fingers and mice and people and everything that has wrists and fingers and you can 
those genes and when they showed for instance that if you say make a mouse lacking these genes the 
has a humerus a radius and ulna but no wrist and digits if you mark the cells that where 
genes are active in the wrists and the digits so these genes are wrist and digit genes necessary for 
wrist and digit not necessarily sufficient there are probably other ones as well but necessary ns so my lab 
well as a bunch of others have asked the question are these genes present in fish the answer is 
known that for a while and if so are these genes involved in fish fin development and again if 
what are they doing in fish fins so what been looking at well it turns out to make a 
long story short this was a research program of my lab longer than tiktaalik actually the search for tiktaalik 
was six years this was laughter ns but the essential idea is that many of the genes that make 
wrists and digits of mice and people and birds and so forth are present in fish and making a 
strip of tissue in those fins and that terminal strip of tissue gives rise to the fin rays those 
spicules of bone that you see if you look at a trout when you look at its fins it 
clear in the terminal end of the fin with little rays inside their little bony rods it makes those 
ns and so remarkable here is that there is a common tool kit to make appendages as different as 
mice and fish fins and limbs that those genes are there that active and that in all species active 
making the terminal end of the fin different is a switch in fish that turns those cells where those 
are active into fin rays whereas in us and mice and others it makes fingers and toes ns so 
able to see is that a common history a genetic history of limbs and fins and that the differences 
them as much in entirely new genes but in using those genes in new ways and modifying their activity 
different ways so a case where molecular biology has given us insights that we might not have had otherwise 
i was just looking at anatomy i would never compare fingers and toes with the fin rays of fish 
but a clearcut developmental connection between them and so now what doing and some other labs are looking at 
well what controls whether you have a finger or a fin ray what are the molecular controls that control 
you make those different kinds of tissues so as we open the whole thing is when you have answers 
we had with this research now we can ask whole new kinds of powerful more precise questions so these 
now set us up for a whole new set of experiments which doing now sc and do you go 
is this by going in and zapping some of the genes to kill them off or keep them going 
or and seeing what kind of organism results ns yeah so what we do is we could take the 
from a mouse and put them in a fish and you can see what they do we could take 
fish genes and put them in a mouse and see what they do in that new environment it turns 
they function very well i could take a shark gene from the fin and put it in a mouse 
of these genes from a shark and then put them into a mouse and it does perfectly fine likewise 
mouse one in the shark ns so we can make these swaps we can also knock these genes out 
can use crisprcas genome editing go in there and just knock these genes out and delete them we can 
factors as well so yeah a real house of horrors here laughter we could do it all but what 
shows is quite literally that there is a deep connection among creatures nothing is i still find it amazing 
we could take a fish gene and put it in a mouse and it functions just fine in the 
of a mouse whereas in a fish it works in its fin that in a nutshell just shows you 
the deep connections among all life on our planet sc are you a fan of the syfy tv show 
ns no i seen it yet afraid sc i think that should be your next project in the lab 
i think i do so yeah surprised they call me to consult sc well at the end of the 
here so now we can let our hair down and speculate a little bit learned a lot about how 
transitions happen in real evolution opening i want to call it box but at least a whole door onto 
new landscape of things where we can make major evolutions in our labs is this going to be a 
over the next hundred years where not just figuring out how evolution happened but designing organisms for human purposes 
already happening you have people growing organs in dishes tissue engineering for clinical purposes as well we already have 
who use computation and a knowledge of evolutionary history to resurrect proteins that were present four hundred million years 
and test their activity no we can reconstruct ancestors at least at the biochemical level we can modify development 
the embryological and developmental level and in the genetic level as well ns and we can begin to mimic 
stages of evolution sometimes helpful sometimes not but definitely in this brave new world where we can manipulate things 
well the big game changer has been obviously genome editing the crisprcas gene editing which applies to so many 
remarkably effective but also remarkably cheap so a lot of issues with boredom when in a big lab ns 
and been a huge game changer for us i have a colleague here in chicago joe thornton literally resurrecting 
proteins to understand how enzymes originally came about and he uses knowledge of evolutionary history and computation to make 
about what those proteins looked like and then he makes them in the lab and tests their activity and 
can tweak genes right now to test can we make a limb bone in a fish fin i have 
colleague from harvard who did just that with a mutant he found and showed that fish fins have the 
to make limblike bones so really remarkable stuff definitely a brave new world sc yeah so the answer is 
we will be just the beginning of all this and people talk about regulating it and so forth and 
rough feeling is that once you can do something someone out there is going to do it and so 
all sorts of organisms and their organs is going to be a major frontier ns i think so i 
what will drive it obviously would be clinical making new kinds of tissues that can help in regeneration regeneration 
a big thing too being able to rebuild organs too and people are pushing the limits of that as 
sc well okay so for the very last question return a little bit back to reality and we talked 
how fins can turn into hands and so forth but the other obvious question is human beings very similar 
other primates but we do have these big brains i recently saw a claim which then i think i 
people arguing against but the claim was that there are mental capacities cognitive capacities that chimpanzees are much better 
than we human beings shortterm memory kinds of tasks and the claim was that we have i want to 
intentionally but we have sacrificed that part of our cognitive capacities in order to develop language and linguistic capacities 
this kind of tradeoff a big part of what turns other primates into we smart and sexy human beings 
chuckle i know the answer to that but tradeoffs are a very huge part of human history tradeoffs in 
of the structure of our brain tradeoffs in terms of the structure of our adrenal system our ability to 
the tradeoffs of just being human are huge because there are costs to being human we suffer certain kinds 
conditions that are not seen in other creatures our ability to talk for instance just shifting it from the 
piece i know less about that honestly but our ability to talk comes at a huge tradeoff so it 
me that cognitive issues do as well so for instance we are the only animals that suffer a particular 
of dangerous sleep apnea and the reason for that is we have a very flexible back of our throat 
a set of neural circuits that play a huge role in our ability to make sounds so our ability 
make sounds for language comes at a giant cost because it sets us up for certain kinds of sleep 
which can be quite dangerous ns but true for almost every part of the human the human body whether 
walking on two legs whether having huge brains that consume an enormous amount of energy whether having cognitive capacities 
make language that are tradeoffs from other kinds of cognitive capacities which we might have had tradeoffs are a 
of being an extreme organism like we are highly optimized in certain ways and that optimization comes at a 
because of the inherent nature of tradeoffs sc i guess i already said this is last question so i 
but i just had a podcast with martin rees where we talked a little bit about the prospects for 
and how in different environments and so forth we might evolve in different ways like people living on mars 
have different skeletal structures or something like that is it completely crazy for an evolutionary biologist to look at 
beings and say well here are things we could improve here are things that we could intentionally change that 
make us better like get rid of backaches or something like that ns oh yeah definitely in fact our 
to the microbial world we can change when you think about just beginning to come to grips with our 
to the microbial world and that relationship can sometimes hurt us but most of the time essential for our 
and something that as we look forward something that is going to be incredibly important to think about but 
you can look at any part of our body and then say well jeez something that needs to change 
forward but a lot depends on the operative environment that we find ourselves living in ns so the environment 
yeah you could say certainly that there are certain aspects of our bodies that in this modern environment that 
of disconnected from we have an evolutionary history in one environment yet many of us are living in built 
now that are very different and we have a sedentary lifestyle so our whole metabolism is sort of illequipped 
evolved from highly active ancestors and most of us are relatively sedentary sc less active chuckle ns you are 
you think about the leading causes of death cardiovascular disease cancers and so forth these are all parts of 
tradeoff of being human and living in our modern world right and so i could think of a whole 
of things that would need to change we are susceptible of all kinds of cancers that are a product 
living in our modern world and a product of living after and so yeah i could give you a 
of many things to change based on where living now and i can give you even a longer list 
telling me going to be living in bases on mars or terraforming somewhere or whatever sc well good good 
know that members of the last generation of purely organic human beings chuckle ns one part iphone actually actually 
with the device sc well we were born organic deteriorated over time alright neil shubin thanks that was a 
conversation thanks for being on the podcast ns thanks for having me appreciate it music this was a really 
episode thanks regarding the fact that the idea of evolution was in the air for some time in the 
athanasius kircher wrote about animals changing and hybridizing to explain how the few species in the ark were able 
generate all the species in the world httpsenwikipediaorgwikiathanasiuskircherbiology pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast neil shubin on evolution genes and 
transitions three quarks daily as a listener in australia somewhat amusedbemused that feel the need to make a disclaimer 
the start to the effect that evolution is real and you be discussing creationism why would you kinda be 
starting a podcast on astronomy with a shoutout that btw you be discussing astrology is creationism really still taken 
seriously in america this was a great podcast nice improvement on the sound quality also comments are closed sean
