hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and a few months ago i went 
twitter and took a brave contrarian stance that empathy is a good thing many people of course would agree 
this automatically but many other people have read a book by guest yale psychology professor paul bloom which is 
which i admit is a completely awesome book title and paul and i actually discussed this on twitter an 
reasonable thoughtful guy and we do in fact disagree his point is that empathy the ability to think about 
from someone point of view to put yourself in their shoes sounds good and maybe it makes us nice 
on a personal level but it gets in the way of being rational moral thinkers sc we tend to 
with people close by with people like ourselves rather than being purely rational about how to be the best 
how to live in the world correctly i on the other hand tend to emphasize the fact that people 
think that being rational will often take things into account that make perfect sense from their point of view 
perhaps not paying as much attention to things that are front and center to people who are living very 
lives than them to me if really going to be rational it is absolutely crucial that you are empathetic 
you try to understand what other people who have very different experiences than you have been going through sc 
paul and i talk about this on the podcast i think we are necessarily coming to any agreement but 
the other hand i think we disagree that much either trying to emphasize different aspects of a problem and 
is an extremely interesting guy i think get a lot out of this conversation and hopefully all be more 
and good to each other at the end of it so as always please check out the mindscape webpage 
preposterousuniversecompodcast where find links to patreon and paypal and keep the podcast going also find transcripts so you get 
see all the words and you can even search through all the archives to see what cool stuff previous 
guests have said and with that go music sc paul bloom welcome to the mindscape podcast paul bloom thanks 
having me here sc i wanna actually thank you especially because a few months ago i was having dinner 
our mutual friend carl pb oh yes sc who was a previous mindscape guest and carl mentioned that every 
he runs into you you say like i was just on another podcast just so many of these laughter 
i presume that quite in demand in this medium pb well yeah but a couple that stand out and 
is one of them sc good to hear good pb i know of you through carl and through your 
books and so just totally thrilled to be here and you and i have had a runin on twitter 
i remember sc yeah if you wanna call that a runin yeah i mean had runins that seem like 
runin from my perspective it was a nice little chat pb a nice little chat but that sort of 
the stage for us to talk in person sc yeah right so lots of things to talk about obviously 
mean psychology is a pretty broad area and worked on work in a lot of areas let me float 
hypothesis and you can either shoot it down or sharpen it up pb okay sc a lot of your 
seems to deal with what we might think of as the boundary between reason and emotion or almost the 
lines between those two things is that a fair characterization pb it really is i mean particularly in my 
work always been interested in how much of our natures are based on emotion and feelings and gut reactions 
to what extent could rational liberation play a role so this crosscuts across a lot of my research sc 
so the answer chuckle how rational can human beings be i think this is actually a more involved topic 
just a simple yes or no answer pb yeah but go for it i think a lot more rational 
most of my colleagues think we are i doubt that a lot of our feelings our judgments particularly our 
judgments are influenced by our emotions often very irrational indeed certainly politically i think politics brings out the worst 
us but i also think we have a tremendous capacity for rational liberation and in fact you see this 
its best in sort of your day job in science in actual science that shows that humans can under 
circumstances be rational and deliberative and come to real insights about the world and i would make the stronger 
that we could do this when it comes to morality when it comes to politics and in our everyday 
sc good so this is a perfect starting point for the conversation because as i have grown older and 
or not wiser my faith in human rationality has only diminished over time so very happy if you are 
be able to convince me otherwise why we start just you know a broad audience from a lot of 
most people probably think of themselves as pretty rational what are the reasons that had from psychology and elsewhere 
start to doubt that perfectly rational beings pb a good way to begin a lot of sort of striking 
from psychology that we as smart as we think we are and i think the foundations of this work 
from the psychologists danny kahneman and amos tversky sc right pb and kahneman eventually won the nobel prize for 
work in economics and what those two did was put together a really impressive body of work showing that 
susceptible to cognitive illusions and cognitive biases we are biased we make mistakes we depart from logical norms mathematical 
in such ways that we could often be tricked and people could exploit us sc right pb and so 
lot of those demonstrations which tend to be sort of more mathematical logicy demonstrations but some of them are 
striking for instance one typical one is we radically overestimate the odds of the likelihood of infrequent yet very 
events like terrorist attacks or being bitten by a shark and you radically underestimate the relative likelihood of pretty 
events like heart conditions and dying of a coronary so one tradition and then the second tradition is more 
and this is social people like jonathan haidt who argue when it comes to our moral reasoning and political 
we might think that we have arguments you might think your views on abortion and the death penalty and 
trump are because a deliberating being but a lot of demonstrations suggesting that actually your views on these things 
determined by other factors and the reasons you give are after the fact justifications so why a lot of 
colleagues are skeptical about the power of reason sc yeah i think that that fits in with the very 
episode we had a mindscape where i talked to carol tavris a social psychologist who has done some work 
cognitive dissonance and she wrote a wonderful book with elliot aronson called were made but not by pb yeah 
all about how we justify the decisions we make and even if the making of the decision was rational 
justification of it would go forward whether or not that original decision was rational pb yes right right and 
these sort of laboratory demonstrations everyday demonstrations suggesting that in some way we live our life as sort of 
book scientists running experiments in the world and coming up with theories rather kind of like to use jonathan 
like lawyers we have to explain something we have to make a case for something after it happened sc 
we have to justify it and in fact in the science fiction realm we caricature mr spock and commander 
in the examples of people without emotions perfectly rational or always the ones learning from we human beings wise 
we have our gut instincts and our emotions are very helpful pb yeah i mean in science fiction i 
even good science fiction really bungles emotions chuckle pb so i so part you capture one part of it 
is somehow data and spock are fatally flawed in some way which they needed to touch the spark of 
that only a captain kirk sc yeah pb that humans have on the other hand i think that they 
miss out on the importance of emotions as motivators if spock and data really had no emotions why would 
get out of bed why would they do things why would why they just sit in a lump in 
fetal position and think thoughts sc well as david hume said is the slave of the right we need 
emotion to give us goals and then reason should tell us how to achieve those goals roughly speaking right 
right and even people like me who wanna push the importance of reason would argue that you need a 
in the pants of emotion sc right pb argued that often much better when it comes to morality when 
try to think our way through and not follow our gut but even i would admit that if we 
gut motivations to care about other people you could come to all the wise moral decisions you want you 
anything chuckle sc well good but i think so that is an important fact about the role of rationality 
that when we invoke it in the cause of some goal which arguably is given to us by emotions 
what saying about rationality is something a little bit different i guess which is saying that despite these social 
studies saying all the different ways in which human beings justify ourselves and make logical mistakes optimistic about the 
to which reasonable pb right and optimistic for all sorts of reasons one reason is we have certain domains 
rationality has proven to be very powerful and very useful science and technology being one example if we really 
such stupid creatures and so reflective and so biased how did we come over time to have such a 
understanding of the universe of domains that we were not evolutionarily prepared to know about yet somehow we managed 
figure it out i think more controversially morality is another domain a lot better people than we were one 
years ago and part of it is i think the exercise of reason over time sc yeah so good 
into this a little bit because i like doing science first i think that science is the perfect example 
psychologists and philosophers should take care of because if we figure out how science works then hopeless like science 
the most straightforward thing that we have much easier than morality and you as you say the power of 
has taken us pretty far in science and understanding the world but then a lot of people on the 
are not very good at science we human beings need to invent all sorts of tricks and doubleblind studies 
prevent ourselves from giving in to our biases is there any way of quantifying whether or not overall rational 
irrational pb yeah in some way i push back a little bit science is in some way a very 
domain i mean for the reasons you gave very unnatural this bizarre thing maybe we stumbled on to and 
turned out to be of extraordinary use and i think science illustrates something which i think brings together your 
of demand on the street with my pushing of reasoning which is that reason will flourish in social institutions 
valued and often sensitive enough of our own weaknesses that we can intelligently create institutions and mechanisms and procedures 
a refutation and experiment and blind review and so on that can lead us to do much better and 
think we see this in other domains as well so if aware of my racial biases i could choose 
use a procedure like blind review or a quota system or something to override them if aware that i 
my kids more than i love other people and would favor them i could support a system which bans 
hiring and so this is sort of a very human story where we have these weaknesses but also smart 
to think our way through and override them and science is this great example of how people manage to 
that sc yeah no i think i mean part of it maybe not that any disagreement or even difference 
on here but just a choice to emphasize one thing or another right like in some sense we are 
with some level of irrationality but we are blessed with enough rationality we can overcome that when really helpful 
right and where you draw the line and emphasis you put on things matters a lot so a lot 
my colleagues emphasize the rationality of our political behavior our voting behavior my temptation is to be more skeptical 
these claims of irrationality and argue for instance that a lot of political behavior seems irrational because psychologists miss 
on the fact that people actually aspiring towards the truth if i really support the red sox and i 
them on and you to say not rational not favored to chuckle then kind of missing the point my 
them on is not this objective assessment where being right matters my cheering them on might have to do 
the community with and who my friends are and who i wanna support sc and that seems to be 
compatible with what read about political allegiances that a lot of times even when asked factual questions we give 
because in our mind subconsciously or consciously those are the right answers to give given our political side pb 
so you take somebody who has a view left or right say about climate change and you say well 
crazy this person know what talking about and they just have the view that other people but your average 
have much stake in being right about climate change or any one of another political issues they have very 
say in what happens whether i have the right view or wrong view will have no influence on my 
or anyone life but it will matter a lot for my friendships and my relationships if i hold a 
view and so people i think people think of politics may be not unreasonably as akin to sports and 
they cheer on their team they boo the other team for a take one example years ago there was 
lot of polling that found a lot of republicans said they believed that obama was born in kenya turns 
there was actually polling where asked people where was trump born and a lot of democrats say trump was 
outside the united states chuckle sc i did not know that one okay pb and i think what they 
saying is they were saying studied these issues saying boo obama boo sc yeah right and even studies where 
you offer them a nickel for getting the right answers suddenly their answers change right pb exactly when you 
incentive structure and make it that actually for once important to be right then people start behaving differently and 
actually think when it comes to local politics people are much smarter they might vote their selfinterest but actually 
curious and engaged in the facts because they matter whether or not you put a stop sign on the 
or you put in sidewalks or you pay more for snow removal well the sort of thing where it 
does matter to my life and my views do matter and then i become more aligned to their truths 
but let me if read i think most of book fast and which is one of those wonderful books 
once you read it it changes the way you think about the world pb brilliant sc and the impression 
get from it is that not being a trained psychologist i think a lot of us have a vision 
a human being or at least ourselves as like it or not a little homunculus inside our brain pushing 
the levels the levers to make us do things and not a very good picture inside the brain pb 
sc but the more psychologically accurate picture is that lots of competing subprocesses going on and lots of heuristics 
shortcuts and commonsensical rules of thumb that we use rather than using the full force of our reason to 
a right answer and then give it in a single unified consciousness pb i think very much right though 
himself has long defended a view that says that there are two general systems and each system probably composed 
composed of many systems so one system is what talking about now a series of gut instincts and emotional 
heuristic and bias heuristics and biases but the second system is a deliberator a slow careful reasoner and in 
of life we use the quick emotional system in fractions of a second we make judgements we let our 
go but we can slow it down when given a puzzle a bat and a ball cost together one 
ten dollars the bat costs ten cents more than the ball how much does the ball cost have you 
that one sc no but i could do it read the book so i know how to slow down 
get it right chuckle pb and i realized under this pressure i probably mangled the example but all sorts 
things like that where an immediate answer and then a slow and reflective answer sc right pb and to 
back to what you were saying before people do differ there are people who are very reflective in their 
and people who tend to go more for their gut but i think that which one you are depends 
part in your nature but it also depends on the environment in and your upbringing and so on but 
illustrates that that in addition to the sort of hodgepodge of heuristics and biases that talking about also something 
in our heads closer to an ideal reasoner at least in principle sc well right so in this picture 
i think if getting the numbers right a system one which is all the heuristics and biases and system 
which is the deliberator the cognitive part is what trying to say that more system two than we give 
credit for or that system two is more powerful when we choose to use it pb both sc okay 
both and i think system two is a really important part of the story psychologists like to say people 
all sorts of dumb mistakes and we talk all about these dumb mistakes sc yeah pb but what so 
example i saw is that i think it was burger king opened up in response to the quarter pounder 
had a third pounder sc yes seen this one pb and then the idea was nobody bought it because 
figured a third pounder must have less meat than the quarter pounder three is less than four sc yes 
so people we love that stuff but what missing missing the fact that i could tell it to you 
we could laugh about it because another part of ourselves that knows a mistake sc right pb and so 
in a kind of odd position of almost laughing at people and ourselves for our stupid mistakes and forgetting 
the fact that we know stupid mistakes sc yeah pb and this is not not a minor problem i 
our psychologists focus on the irrational has left us largely unprepared to explain things like moral and scientific and 
progress sc right pb which often work on deliberation and even if system two the rationalizer only works of 
time a very important sc sure and is this pushback that you wanna give the pro power of reason 
of thing is that based on studies or experiments that doing or are you just sort of surveying the 
art there pb so in my own work been most interested in this in the domain of morality and 
basis for my critique my critique basically my descriptive claim is capable of moral reasoning much more than many 
us think and in my normative claim i claim that how we should live our lives is we really 
better better people morally better when we we rely on our reasoning rather than our gut feelings sc yeah 
and so in my other work sort of argued against that emotions like disgust lead us morally astray more 
i have argued this about empathy argued that empathy often leads us to make bad and immoral choices and 
basis for my argument is to some extent philosophical arguments and examples from philosophers showing the limitations of empathy 
to some extent experimental there are some very clever experiments by dan batson and many others showing how illustrating 
very sharp terms how relying on our feelings leads to terrible and immoral mistakes sc right yeah so you 
a book one of the great titles of the history of books pb thank you i have some ambivalence 
my title it catches eye but had no end of trouble sc it took me a while to learn 
lesson of being an author that the title the purpose of the title is not to summarize the book 
sell the pb yeah sc and to get people to read it and i think that it worked for 
book pb yes although the purpose of my title seems to be to provoke people to send me unhinged 
sc oh sorry to hear that yeah too bad but if they do that after buying the book then 
job here is done pb right on balance i regret it sc good so and i do so this 
where we started to disagree on twitter and i think we still disagree but again gonna be open up 
to you changing you my mind once and for all pb well same here sc tell be systematic how 
define empathy and why you think that we give it too much credit pb yeah i mean one of 
worst things about this topic is forced to start in the most boring of all ways by defining my 
sc i know chuckle pb people use the term empathy in all sorts of ways and a lot of 
think empathy just means goodness and kindness and morality sc right pb and if using the term that way 
against it and all in favor of being good and kind and moral meaning in the reasonably narrow sense 
how a lot of psychologists and philosophers use it which is getting in another shoes feeling what they feel 
the world through their eyes feeling their pain and this seems like a very good thing and all sorts 
examples where it could be a good thing but the problem is when you come to your moral views 
your moral decisions based on zooming in on through the perspective of another person several things happen for one 
very biased much more likely to feel empathy for you a fellow professor maybe same age same ethnicity than 
am to feel empathy for somebody who is a different color skin or a woman or lives in a 
land speaks a different language so that kind of bias more likely to feel empathy for the attractive than 
ugly for the safe than the scary empathy is innumerate pb and so empathy draws us to the fate 
the one but leaves us neutral or ignoring the fate of the and just to kind of wrap it 
because empathy is sort of so biased and can be focused often used as a tool for what i 
is our unpleasant ends last night our president gave a speech to the nation where he argued for a 
wall now putting aside not a topic for here whether the argument is a good one or a bad 
but putting that aside what notice is donald trump uses empathic arguments all the time sc sure pb he 
about victims he talks all the time of victims and people who are murdered and people who are raped 
this is a tried and true method to generate animosity towards a group so when some people think of 
they think of charity i tend to think of war sc yeah pb empathy is just it can be 
and often is and certainly is in these times sc yeah that actually harkens back to a podcast i 
with yascha mounk where he talks about the word and you might think that populism would be a good 
pb yeah sc we have a democracy you should do what the people want but in practice populism is 
about defining some people as not the people right as outside the set of people who really matter pb 
think right i think there are all sorts of things that feel good but if you look at how 
in every day life they have terrible ends sc yeah and again this might end up being one of 
things where in fact in complete agreement but are just choosing to emphasize different things but play that out 
get it on the table so i think i understand your argument and in some sense much of what 
say is just obviously true right clearly we are more empathetic for people who are like ourselves and therefore 
causes trouble is it safe to say that what you would like to emphasize instead of empathy is a 
strictly rational approach to morality pb yeah i think that there are always gonna not pretending that i have 
solution to moral problems i know whether utilitarian or deontological a whole lot of problems that not pretending to 
but when we rid ourselves of making decisions based on empathic pull it leads to changes in our moral 
that i think everybody would agree are better sc yeah pb i think nobody who would defend the idea 
an attractive life is worth more than an ugly person or that one life is worth more than a 
yeah my claim would be that the alternative to empathy in that regard is thinking through realizing what your 
goals are and trying to figure out the best way to achieve them sc okay good so two concerns 
two thoughts in my mind first is i help but think that the problem that raising is not that 
have empathy but that we always do it right or almost that we have enough empathy for the right 
right like if true that i have a lot of empathy for a small child drowning in the pond 
walking by and i have empathy for starving millions of people in africa then an alternative different strategy just 
well train yourself to have more empathy for the people who are in africa pb yeah i think very 
there are two issues with it one is i think some problems with empathy which really are intrinsic to 
so empathy by its very nature zooms you in on single individuals sc right pb so empathy is not 
mental system that deals with numbers and to the extent that some moral judgments should deal with numbers that 
thousand lives are worth more than empathy leaves you silent in fact kind of worse empathy prioritizes a single 
you zoom in on and at the expense of faceless individuals who you now you could imagine if god 
to make decisions through empathy and god could empathize with a billion creatures at the same time maybe it 
be less of a problem sc yeah pb but limited and empathy is for us a spotlight and spotlights 
brightly on spaces but they have their limits and then just the second point is true if we could 
empathy in an unbiased fashion it would many of the problems talking about arise but we sort of like 
said you have to decide on a graduate student or a new faculty member to hire just choose the 
you like the most but try to make it so your liking well if your liking biased if your 
was fully on the merits then liking is a good measure but not how people work gonna like somebody 
kind of is charming and acts and is interested in you and comes from a similar place so a 
system is trying to make it so that you use liking you use more objective criteria sc right but 
know in some sense we started with this discussion of the relationship between reason and emotions and how emotions 
of provide a starting point for reason to then say our program carry it there be a similar situation 
empathy where empathy gives us a starting point and then reason takes over and says wait a minute a 
bit unfair just to be empathetic with this person take the thing that we started with and be more 
about pb it could i mean empathy could be a spark for good actions you could see somebody suffering 
their pain and then move to help them and your helping them could be mindful of other people it 
be respectful it could have none of the problems i worry about i doubt that that can happen on 
other hand you could feel empathy for a group of people and it could lead you towards violence towards 
group of people sc yeah i think that the point that you make that empathy tends to be singular 
easier to have this response with a person with a face and a description and so forth a very 
point and there are very few sensible moral systems that say that should be our motivation pb right right 
sometimes people say are you pushing a peter singerlike consequentialism or is there certain moral position i have my 
but to see that empathy leads you astray i think you could make the case that no matter where 
morality is within a certain reasonable range say not the right way to do sc right pb but to 
back to your point entirely right and i would happily concede that empathy could spark you towards good moral 
so too for anger anger is a very interesting emotion anger sometimes gets a bad rap and i think 
can do better than being motivated by anger but anger at an injustice could really motivate you to do 
good stuff as well i think in general though i try to the subtitle on my book which is 
in your face than the title is case for rational sc right pb and i think what people call 
a general desire to improve lives i think a better motivator than either empathy or anger or disgust or 
or guilt sc yeah pb but again i i disagree i can name all sorts of cases where empathy 
well as anger disgust shame or guilt led to good action sc yeah no perfectly fair i wanna say 
matter but all sorts of starting points for good things that we can get to pb right i mean 
and i probably like racism very much sc racism is bad yeah an official mindspace platform pb yeah right 
leave not gonna edit this one out so bad but a trivial exercise to think of cases where racism 
have a good effect if you think for instance if a horrible politician and somebody uses racist appeals to 
anybody from electing this horrible politician and as a result the world is so much better well racism did 
good sc right pb but still say but in general a bad way to do sc yeah pb not 
to morally relevant features that you wanna focus on sc good this is very clarifying i think that there 
is a lot of truth here and the connotations of the word empathy are just so positive this is 
is such a great book title right that it deserves a little bit of pushback just so we even 
only to think of it properly overall pb i think it is and it goes back to what you 
with which is i kinda wanna make the case for reason and against emotions in other work i tried 
argue that look disgust is a very unreliable way to make moral decisions but what i found was everybody 
with me chuckle pb i mean a sort of liberal milieu of people who read these kinds of books 
they went that makes total sc yeah pb so i wanna say sort of emotion would you think would 
and i can make the case that even for that better off with more rational approaches so that brought 
to empathy sc right so let me get on to my second point then which is actually where we 
on twitter i tried to make i said that i forget exactly what i said but i think the 
was that empathy is a crucial part of rationality in a very real sense and so this is what 
really wanna get your opinion on i think that we quite got there on twitter pb yeah sc because 
am skeptical about human ability to be rational but as a trained scientist i know that we can get 
by using tricks and strategies to make ourselves seem more rational i think that one of the most important 
and strategies is the need to try to empathize with people unlike ourselves and what i see over and 
again in people who are well selfdescribed is extremely rational and to be fair often are rational but choosing 
look at certain things going on in the world and just not paying attention to other things going on 
the world and i would argue because they are very different than the people that happening to so they 
discount these bad things pb yeah sc i just this morning read an article in the paris review by 
kwon about how difficult it is for her to read novels by male authors describing female characters they just 
the fear that women live in walking down the streets at night by themselves and i think that one 
the major tricks that a person trying to be rational should use if they want to get a theory 
morality and justice and how to arrange society is doing everything they can to empathize with people very unlike 
pb yeah i think a lot of truth to that and that kind of brings us a little bit 
different senses of empathy so one sense of empathy a matter of feeling what another one feels i actually 
among other things not very good at it so for me to say to well to a woman in 
position for instance who i could really get to understand and feel what like to be in your seems 
but i do think and i think right i think we should make an effort to try to understand 
lives of people very different from us it makes us better people it makes us understand the world more 
sc sure pb i mean so much of the best literature and movies and books is the exhilaration of 
to understand a world different from your own sc yeah i think but i wanna be a little bit 
than that pb yeah sc i think that because as a scientist as a physicist i know all of 
strategies that we use when i had kip thorne on the podcast we talked about this fact that the 
experiment that detected gravitational waves they had a whole protocol by which a little subcommittee would inject fake signals 
the data and then the entire rest of the collaboration would have to pretend well they would not know 
it was a real signal or fake so they would analyze the data write a paper the whole bit 
that was the only way to be fair and i think that likewise when talking about racism we all 
racism is bad but lots of people who think that racism is basically over pb yeah sc that there 
bad effects from racism and i think that those people whatever conclusions they reach they have an obligation to 
try very very hard to make sure they are seeing things from the perspective of people who are suffering 
racism and that seems to me to be the definition of empathy pb i would agree with that but 
think important to get to causality right so not like a guy who just care about other races i 
care about sc sure pb and i think no problem with race and so on and then if in 
example and then i somehow find myself empathizing with somebody from a far off land or a racial minority 
my community that expands my moral circle i think actually how it happens i think we find ourselves almost 
accident empathizing people whose lives are very different from ours often very good at keeping our empathy close closed 
i think what happens is is people come through rationality and other means to a broader world view a 
cosmopolitan view say and then because of this they choose to empathize with others and try to understand the 
of others sc good pb and i hate to be too agreeable chuckle but i do think if in 
i was one running a diverse lab with people with different backgrounds i might have a fundamentalist christian i 
have someone who has a severe hearing disability and so on in order to run as well with both 
and also trying to be a good person i guess i should try my best to know what like 
be these other people i do think though that the best way to find out to go through some 
exercise mostly usually to ask them i sc always very good advice i agree pb i think somewhat of 
arrogance to say that somebody like you or somebody like me could feel what like to be in a 
different situation we try a pleasure in trying what literature movies and so on but if i really wanna 
what like to be to have a severe disability or come from a very different culture or be a 
in a very secular society i think empathy itself in the sense of sort of degrading my teeth and 
to put myself in a shoes is the way to go i think what you do is you talk 
the person you treat them and you come to conclusion that and maybe say actually not gonna end up 
what like to be a woman in a sexist society really not never gonna really feel it but i 
listen to people in that situation talk to them about fair decent what satisfies principles of justice morality and 
pb so maybe i am actually being disagreeable chuckle i would argue that somebody with no capacity for empathy 
any interesting sense who is willing to listen to people and who who honored principles of justice and morality 
fairness could be a great moral person and could do very well in the world well someone who really 
to feel what like to be other people i actually think is running all sorts of sort of moral 
practical risks sc good actually i love that even just sort of a final emphasis i think that really 
what i take to be the heart of what saying that i am very happy to agree with interesting 
thought experiment of someone who had no empathy i could agree that as long as we somehow gave them 
right moral starting point they could be a very moral person and then i would say just to be 
about it that since none of us are that person and we do have empathy that and we do 
other emotions discussed and tribal identification and so forth that the combination of rationality and empathy aimed at the 
people is a crucial tool in overcoming our first most primitive instincts there you go pb well not bad 
kind chuckle pb you know the long been out so willing to concede some points but let me put 
this way and curious whether you agree or disagree i think that suppose you just take the example that 
familiar with if running a large and diverse lab with a lot of people or department or something with 
lot of people i actually think high levels of empathy are more likely to be a hindrance than a 
they will do good in exactly the way talking about give you the person the possibility of feeling what 
to be somebody very different from them but as is typically utilized the person of high empathy will just 
a lot about the fates of people who standardly elicit empathy it takes a lot of effort to shift 
from the usual targets and focus them to people who the usual targets like any sort of bias that 
bias towards the familiar and the friendly and the people like you that mean that people with high empathy 
then people with high feelings in general will just naturally direct these feelings towards those who are like them 
they have the capacity to do otherwise but of the time be zooming in on that person who was 
like them when they were in graduate school sc yeah pb and how could you not understand that struggles 
difficulty well this weird person in the corner with the funny clothes and a funny accent yeah i could 
like to be them but a lot of work chuckle sc good yeah i think at this point slicing 
baloney of our differences very thinly and most people get it i mean you wanna correctly i think point 
that giving into the empathy that we naturally have can lead to just as many deleterious consequences as good 
i wanna emphasize the fact that trying to have empathy for people unlike ourselves is a useful corrective good 
good sc if people can choose their own balance there pb we could have a twitter poll sc yeah 
not done not done writing books moving onto other things noticed that interested in cruelty these days very much 
that the sequel to against empathy will be favor of that will be a great book title chuckle pb 
sc leaning into the contrarian part of the stuff pb yeah actually quite against cruelty sc oh no chuckle 
but but i will satisfy your appetite for the controversial i have heterodox views about dehumanization sc right which 
good yeah pb so maybe maybe my book could be in favor of dehumanization or at least dehumanization is 
the problem you think it is sc yeah related to the empathy thing right putting ourselves in the shoes 
somebody else and now sort of turning that on its head a little bit how do we perceive or 
about the people who are not being nice to pb right and so it stems from my empathy work 
is a really sensible challenge to me is look if you have empathy you really relate fully see the 
of other people and when you see the humanity of other people they argue you dehumanize them and you 
of them as fully human and once you do that terrible morally terrible so if you really know what 
to be another person you really feel what like to be them you treat them as full humans you 
to treat them with respect and love and i sc this is a conventional point of view right pb 
think every word of wrong sc good pb dehumanizing is awful to treat somebody as less than human is 
make a moral and factual mistake but been convinced by a lot of people really smart thinkers on this 
kwame anthony appiah and kahneman and others that some of the worst things we do to other people are 
full recognition of their humanity sc right which is a very depressing conclusion i have to say pb it 
very depressing conclusion the dehumanization thesis is so cheerful sc yeah pb it basically says you know all the 
in the world based on a if if people are confusingly think the jews or the blacks or the 
or the women fully human once they come to their senses and realize that real people then all this 
and nasty stuff will go away so cheering but i think when you look at atrocities and everyday violence 
cruelty often motivated by a full appreciation of humanity so all sorts case studies that kahneman makes the case 
gender violence like domestic abuse of women by men and she says look when this guy hates women or 
or beats up on his spouse not that thinking of them nonhuman just things just if you thought that 
would you wanna make people suffer why would you be so angry at them rather responding in a way 
responds to people people could be a source of delight and love and transcendence but people could really make 
if i sean if i wanted to make you suffer well the way that would happen is if somehow 
felt you were humiliating me or you had done some horrible moral wrong or you were this deep threat 
me all very human things well if i thought of you as just an object or a machine or 
animal well then maybe i treat you kindly but have no interest in hurting you sc yeah we go 
of our way to abuse chairs and tables right like we go out of our way to abuse people 
exactly exactly exactly now again dehumanization is terrible because we also go out of our way to treat chairs 
table with any respect or any kindness so a lot of mass exterminations often say just sc yeah pb 
torture degradation humiliation both at sort of the atrocity level but also at individual level seem to involve the 
that dealing with people and some laboratory work on this finding that sometimes when you view somebody as morally 
or a morally bad individual you in fact you exaggerate their human traits as if to make it sort 
their evilness more salient and to give you more of an invitation to hurt them sc can you give 
an example of that pb yeah this is work by tage rai and his colleagues very nice research where 
give people scenarios where you ask them to do different things to people all hypothetical pen and paper stuff 
in one condition you say if i gave you a large sum of money to break this sc right 
and another condition so imagine that imagine so much money you help but do it and then another condition 
this guy is a serial rapist give a great detail now suppose you decide on this grounds to breaks 
thumb if willing to do it it shifts your feelings towards him in different ways so if your hurting 
is instrumental tend to dehumanize him say it matter not much of a person but if your hurting of 
is sort of moralistic and rai does studies moralistic violence you tend to accelerate his human traits similarly if 
wanna get somebody to hurt somebody for money do better by saying just a thing they feel sc yeah 
but if you wanna get somebody to hurt somebody else in response to something that that person did if 
focus on their moral traits do better so you and again this has political resonance think how you would 
if you want people to lash out on immigrants what you would say about immigrants and it depends to 
of if you want them to ignore the immigrants or just treat them as dispensable or disposable say one 
if you wanted them to really hate them you would say another sc right and so what does this 
us about human psychology i mean in some sense is it a little bit too glib to say wanna 
around hurting so if just for instrumentally paid money we wanna dehumanize them but this countervailing punishment reflex or 
reflex pb punishment moralization a lot of people have pointed out that when we when cruel to one another 
think of ourselves as villains we say my god such a terrible person for wanting that person to rather 
proud of ourselves we think of ourselves as moral agents again you see this in the political realm you 
the on twitter a lot too much but i sc well as an experimental lab for cruelty you know 
good place as any pb all data and you see the extraordinary nastiness directed towards some groups of people 
other groups of people because people the hatred directed i know social justice warriors on the one hand versus 
activists on the other hand sc right pb and the people directing this hatred and cruelty think such a 
person for doing rather proud of themselves because harvey weinstein or donald trump or bernie sanders or whoever this 
is they have it coming bad people and they have it coming and what this suggests is in general 
then which i think is true is that our moral feelings towards other people have multiple consequences it drives 
and love and kindness it also drives cruelty and reprisal and punishment and so seeing somebody as a person 
all sorts of consequences sc yeah is so do we conclude that in some sense we have natural tendencies 
toward reward and punishment with respect to other people we think some people should be rewarded some people just 
be punished as the right valorous just thing to do pb we do and i think this is universal 
in my own day job done studies with children and babies and we have research suggesting that by a 
birthday they have some moral intuitions they distinguish good guys from bad guys they favor good guys over bad 
you look at about will reward good guys and punish bad guys by giving treats or taking away treats 
few years later you get to emergence of socalled altruistic punishment where actually give up resources to make another 
suffer and big cultural differences in this and it changes across in age and gender and society but i 
what talking about the desire to reward the good and punish the bad is actually part of our human 
sc and not just a casual cruelty to people we meet that it it sounds like it has important 
for the criminal justice system for example pb it does it does and so take one example a lot 
people who think impact statements are wonderful things where the victim talks about the trauma he or she has 
with the death their being raped or being assaulted or the death of a child or something and then 
jury or the judge now based on that determines the punishment and i could i know why people favor 
giving the victim a voice is very powerful but this seems to have all the worst features of empathy 
punitive desire sc right so pb among other differences that means if the victim is an attractive articulate person 
a greater punishment towards the perpetrator than if the victim is ugly and sullen sc right so yeah this 
very much along this theme of the relationship between reason and emotion the statement is blatantly appealing to emotion 
saying this person did the following things that plug into an algorithm and figure out how to treat them 
the criminal justice saying what they did is really emotionally resonant so they should be treated and what saying 
no way to run a justice pb i am exactly right just like i think empathy is no way 
guide who kind to or what we do for charity our punitive impulses would often feed off of empathy 
a terrible way to run a criminal justice system for all sorts of reasons of bias depending on who 
individual is but also because the question of how much something offends our gut is actually not a really 
way to decide how to meet out punishment sc right and i think here more or less completely on 
i think the anticruelty is an easier sell than the antiempathy bandwagon but just for purposes of conversation let 
push back a little bit yeah we did start by saying there is this relationship between emotion and reason 
something to be said for letting some of our emotional resonance into our decisionmaking process even if that emotional 
is this person is bad they should be punished they should be treated badly pb yeah i think sort 
a question of where and when i think much of the claim i think what arguing for that because 
our emotions about somebody who did a horrible crime prison rape becomes this amusing matter to us where an 
of somebody being raped in prison is a source of amusement and pleasure i think that that sort of 
us to exercise the worst aspects of ourselves on the other hand i think raising an important point which 
to have a rich life is to have a life that includes emotions and emotions play an important role 
our feelings towards others so not against being biased towards your friends over other people your family or other 
not against feeling empathy for those you love in sort of intimate personal ways and not even against some 
of retribution or punitive aspects towards people in everyday interactions if you write a savage review of my laughter 
well well you know we are humans sc string up laughter pb well okay well you said that but 
laughter sc had book reviews i know what like chuckle pb where i go just for a little while 
could exercise the fantasy sc yeah proportional response overlapping conversation pb yes laughter sc well can we learn so 
realization that an element of being cruel comes not from dehumanization but from humanization is that actionable intelligence can 
learn to be less cruel people by appreciating that fact pb i think so i think in general i 
be quite skeptical about what psychology tells us about how to live our everyday lives but i think this 
one case where just simply knowing it makes a difference and this comes up in cases it actually has 
up in issues of international relations where it used to be thought for instance that if you only if 
israelis only knew what it was like to be palestinian and palestinians only knew what it was like to 
israelis then peace would reign and so on and been sophisticated psychologists that looked at this and often find 
increased intimacy and understanding of other minds and what goes on in their often makes things worse and not 
sc yeah pb if you really know what like to be in the head of somebody who hates you 
a good thing laughter pb and maybe treating them as a little bit less of an individual and more 
a problem to be solved and somebody in a negotiation partner is actually better off i think it teaches 
in general to be a bit more conscious about the idea that getting close to another person will make 
kinder to them sc well i certainly do think having had some conversations about the nature of morality and 
and things like that plenty of people are willing to just stop being rational about these things they know 
wrong just right i need to justify it anymore and certainly on board in taking a moral behavior or 
behavior as being subject to rational analysis just like everything else pb right and complicated in all sorts of 
ways for one thing i think in the and you were talking about this when we talked about hume 
the beginning gonna be some moral intuitions just like gonna be some scientific intuitions that are sort of rock 
if you agree with me that hurting people is wrong not clear we have much more to talk about 
right pb but if you say to me we gotta gonna have open and i say why do you 
and you just say a fundamental moral and you stomp your feet well not very productive laughter sc yeah 
sound like something that should qualify as a even if the right view whether or pb right sc not 
fundamental it should be derived from something a little bit more pb had arguments about charter schools sc yeah 
for some reason this is a fundamental moral position and i say laughter pb and in some way if 
think of the function of political moral arguments sometimes when people do that not that they appreciate that you 
actually argue about these things what saying is immoral to do so sc yeah pb what saying is actually 
the kind of person i am i wanna be seen and see myself as somebody who crossed the line 
sc well you noted earlier that you were not trying to take a certain stance toward what is the 
and for all correct moral theory right but can i just ask for textual purposes would you qualify yourself 
a moral realist do you think there is ultimately right and wrong or is it more constructed by individual 
and societies pb yeah definitely a moral realist i think that there are facts to the matter as to 
and wrong now i think moral truths are the same as physical truths sc right pb i think if 
were no people be no morality if there was if people were constituted differently our morality would be differently 
given how people are constituted i think there are things you would say are moral truths or at least 
universals sc yeah pb so you know a lot of philosophy here that some of it that goes meta 
some it goes over my head but i would think that there are you could point to another culture 
humans and say doing things and if they came up to you and said we agree all all of 
we like slavery or we like the oppression of i think one could say just mistaken if you thought 
realize you be doing things that sc yeah tough to say because like you already admitted not the same 
of mistake as if they thought that the earth was the center of the universe not a mistake you 
disprove by doing some experiment pb right right so it is harder you just say if only you had 
telescopes or paid more attention and thought things through you would simply know on the other hand and here 
of borrowing an argument from sam harris who i fully agree with on this but his argument strikes me 
good which is because human and human you guys share certain premises say that unnecessary suffering is bad and 
could sort of if you spend enough time with them and rational which they would be given enough time 
could persuade them the way doing things say slavery work it respect what you think should be respecting it 
what you think should be maximized so not coming in as a century american saying doing things wrong by 
rather what doing is saying to them say nazi germany or whatever saying doing things wrong by your lights 
you thought about this long enough realize that the way doing things violates your own intuitions of how it 
be sc yeah not gonna solve this here and a little bit off topic but i just need to 
into my disagreement with sam about exactly this point which is i think kind of it might very well 
true and as a matter of practice very willing to believe that it is true that i can reason 
very different people doing very different things on the basis of common moral intuitions but i think a huge 
to then leap from that to say we need to be more realists we need to be more realists 
just have to find that common ground and reason from there and i think that as a matter of 
not a moral realist i think that you can just accept the reality that morals are constructed by human 
and go from there pb for the purposes here i will agree with that sc yep chuckle pb moral 
is another step sc exactly right pb and tentative about making that step but at the same time you 
sort of asked whether a moral realist or moral relativist moral relativism is typically associated with the position that 
if enough people if in a society are happy with some way of doing things then fine by them 
you and i are both universalists in a sense that we think a fundamental human nature so some groups 
do it right some groups can do it wrong enough for me sc yeah like i said not gonna 
even a universalist a constructivist but okay it make any difference to how you act in the world is 
is my only point right now i pb as long as we can disapprove of other people sc right 
people boy until i have them on the podcast and then get their say but speaking of sam you 
a very just to wrap things up you wrote a provocative little piece with him about robots and artificial 
start torturing the robots is that a bad thing should we extend some of the considerations had here to 
intelligences where do you come down there pb yeah it was a hugely fun article with sam it grew 
of actually a podcast discussion i had with him and it was focused around westworld the example of westworld 
was showing at the time we were talking we were both watching it and sure you know but so 
some people that the story of westworld originally a movie then an hbo series is in the near future 
create this wild western fantasy which you could visit and it contains incredibly realistic robots who are indistinguishable from 
and some of the guests take advantage of this to kill to rape to torture and so on and 
yeah because just robots right pb pardon me yes right sc because just robots who cares pb right right 
so you it was a fun article to write surprising uncontroversial you never know but what we said is 
that you you rape and torture and kill robots like and our argument was twofold one part of it 
that you know they might be conscious and if they were conscious and could feel pain then you definitely 
that for the same reason you do of a person and then the second part of it is even 
you could know for sure that they conscious it seems likely to us at least that doing this to 
that were indistinguishable from people would affect your relationships with people so like position sc yeah pb being cruel 
animals which is he thought nothing wrong with being cruel to animals but said if you were it would 
you cruel to people sc right i mean these are two very different arguments that presenting so pb the 
one i take it is not very controversial sc yeah but although you made me think that i really 
a chance when i interviewed david chalmers on the podcast we talked about two topics which i considered to 
more or less separate one was the nature of consciousness and the other is we live in a and 
thinks that consciousness is not reducible to the physical that a mental properties over and above physical properties but 
also believes that the things that happen in a simulation are just as real as things that happened in 
socalled real world pb yeah sc but i quite prod him on whether or not there was tension there 
i simulate an intelligence but without the consciousness awareness properties that we human beings have is it still torture 
do bad things to it and i think gonna be pretty down to earth and say just as just 
pb yeah i would say i would say often a fact of the matter i mean if i know 
i put a happy face on my laptop and scream at it and try to verbally humiliate it just 
something foolish not doing something wrong but the same if i yell at my alexa or my siri as 
people do but so a fact of the matter as to whether in its consciousness conscious or not and 
the second part of the argument is that even if it if sorry my alexa just spoke up laughter 
here we go even if not conscious it would still be bad and this is kind of a funny 
for me to make i think that the claims that violent video games make people worse and violent to 
is actually are actually mistaken so little evidence for it and so much evidence against it sc right pb 
the other hand if you could go and beat a child to death with your hands knowing not a 
but a sc yeah pb indistinguishable from a child what would that do to you and i think the 
is nothing good sc well and i think that westworld is a wonderful example to use but i think 
very realistic that in the very short term this kind of problem is gonna show up right we have 
dolls that are looking very realistic we have things like siri and alexa that can talk to us and 
emotions even if not conscious by definition the idea that it seems to us just like we are torturing 
harming something that is like a person is gonna become frighteningly plausible pb it is gonna it is gonna 
sooner or later the trend is gonna go towards increasingly complex and realistic machines including sex robots and what 
like kind of a fun goofy science fiction example now could be quite serious in a decade now i 
would you put an estimate on how far we are from a machine indistinguishable from a person sc i 
that this a great question and it depends a lot on how careful you are about distinguishing laughter i 
that not that far from machines that you could be tricked into thinking are human if you try that 
right i think there i think that been these artificial intelligence programs that can do call center kind of 
and ordinary humans tell the difference but if you really put your mind to it in trying to give 
the turing test and they would still i think still very far from being able to pass that pb 
think so too i think much harder than people say and i think it just maybe possible as with 
cars the last gonna kill us sc yeah right good so be nice to the robots be nice to 
other and empathize with some people in the right circumstances and mostly be driven by our rationality how about 
pb i think a fine way to end sc alright paul bloom thanks so much for being on the 
this was very helpful and a lot of fun pb thanks for having me this was great music we 
an empirical test for this autistic people have very little to no empathy are they terrible people i read 
book but based on the interview i agree with professor bloom from my point of view empathy is being 
at the costs of truth and of competence in a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination was running around 
hampshire and iowa shouting feel your my reaction was but democrats ate it up and bill clinton won the 
delegates and the nomination that was my first experience with empathy and i learned the word yet i was 
there was the movie where the title character has syndrome the total inability to see things from point of 
i thought that adam was perfectly healthy and the rest of his world needed to be cured of the 
to lie i have had rather serious issues with the incompetence of the clerks in offices hiring practices it 
put a high value on empathy and a low one on competence and i have learned to find the 
person in an office if one exists and to direct all of my comments to that one person book 
now on my reading queue pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast paul bloom on empathy rationality morality and cruelty three 
daily people on the autism spectrum have been thought to have a deficit in cognitive empathy perspectivetaking not affective 
empathy paul book is mainly about affective empathy currently writing a lengthy blog post on empathy as it was 
large part of my doctoral research which considers book at length it will be longer as a result of 
to this podcast episode but one benefit of critically analyzing empathy as a moral emotion is that it may 
to people no longer equating empathy broadly to morality and also that people with autism are broadly deficient in 
thereby suggesting that they are also deficient in morality thanks for that entertaining podcast still not much in the 
of actual disagreement maybe one of these days minor correction on the bat and ball puzzle it is typically 
as bat and ball together cost one hundred ten dollars the bat costs more than the ball how much 
the ball great podcast thank you both on the topic of cruelty paul on twitter a lot sean an 
lab for cruelty lol a recent small attitudinal study conducted by amaze the peak body for autistic people and 
families in victoria australia found that while of people in the general sample surveyed thought they had a good 
of how to support autistic people less than of the autistic respondents agreed jones et al attitudes behaviours towards 
and experiences of autistic people and their twelve december sobering stats indeed some of the comments responding to this 
interesting discussion on empathy certainly reveal how widely autistic people and autism more generally are misunderstood in the mainstream 
sean interesting to observe how often autism comes up in the discussions with your guests i found much food 
thought in lisa observations about embodied cognition in this respect it would be fascinating to hear a thoughtful discussion 
neurodiversity ie one that get caught up in the culture wars and what embracing it might mean for intellectual 
especially in areas like theoretical physics which appear to the outsider to be dominated by orthodoxies and cliques of 
empathy may be problematic for many but it is absolutely essential for those in power especially elected leaders presidents 
members of congress who lack empathy have little chance of improving the lives of families living below the poverty 
too many politicians are admirers of the economic policy advocated by ayn rand who advocated the cruel philosophy of 
selfishness and denied that government had a legitimate role in improving the economic welfare of united states citizens without 
empathetic eleanor roosevelt who used her influence with her husband and democrats in congress it is doubtful that the 
net of social security could have been passed in although she argued against congress establishing this vital program she 
for and was granted much needed ss benefits in her old age it seems to me that sucessful politicians
