the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll as many of you doubtless know in the especially near the end 
the decade the very last years of the century cosmologist began to put together a picture of the inventory 
what our universe is made of a weird answer that science is giving us whereby only of the stuff 
the universe by energy is ordinary matter by which we mean all of the atoms all the particles ever 
in particle accelerators or any other experiment that kind of stuff which includes all the galaxies that you see 
the light that you see from stars and planets and so forth it all adds up to only of 
stuff in the universe another is something called dark matter which we think is some kind of particle that 
just see and the other is something called dark energy which might be the energy of empty space itself 
now i know to a lot of people who are not professional astronomers or cosmology this dark stuff this 
the universe seems like some kind of fudge factor just a recognition that astronomers understand what the universe is 
but in fact these are testable hypotheses and over the last couple of decades astronomers have been increasing the 
with which we can test and talk about dark matter in particular to enormous accuracy sc so in fact 
life of a real astronomer is not spent thinking about is their dark matter or there but we can 
map out where the dark matter seems to be how acting how interacting with other kinds of particles both 
matter and ordinary matter how dark matter can influence the formation of stars and galaxies and even more sc 
podcast guest is lina necib she is currently i think currently a postdoc here at caltech my home institution 
the fall gonna start a job at mit as a new faculty member there and lina specialises in the 
and astrophysics of dark matter how detected and how we map out where it is in our galaxy knowing 
the dark matter is knowing how much of it there is in different parts of space is crucial if 
do eventually want to detect it and of course the goal that we build a laboratory experiment here where 
can see the dark matter directly if able to do that know what it is but to be able 
do that we need to know how much of it to expect in our experiments sc so fascinating both 
the particle point of view wondering what the dark matter might be and also from the astrophysics point of 
thinking about the dynamics of stars and gas and dust and how they interact with the dynamics of dark

way very nice when people send a couple of bucks my way but i just like the fact that 
many people are listening to it especially when in the middle of a global mess and we have to 
together in different ways i think that this episode is one really going to enjoy go music sc lina 
welcome to the mindscape podcast lina necib thank you so much for having me sc so here to talk 
dark matter and get into some of the weeds i think but first assuage some of the doubts out 
probably most listeners of the podcast will be willing to accept the existence of dark matter even if we 
what it is but i know that there are some skeptics someone who really devotes their career to studying 
matter what is the answer you give when someone says is that and why do you think ln i 
say that a very good question one of the most important physics questions actually currently and for the past 
about one hundred years now start with what is dark matter basically in the early and especially in the 
have been a lot of studies in trying to understand how much mass there is out there based on 
example the dynamics of stars the motion of galaxies the motion of stars you try to figure out what 
their mass and then if you kinda do the math if you calculate estimating the mass based on the 
or the amount of light that you see versus based on the kinematics or the motion of stars and 
fast going you realise that there is a quite bit of a discrepancy there and basically the theory of 
matter is to try to figure out what else is missing or how do we fix this ln i 
the simplest way to think about it is that basically the stars in our galaxy and our galaxy is 
disk spiral galaxy that you can see in a lot of the pictures but basically the stars are rotating 
than you would expect you would expect that their rotational velocity is going to drop as a function of 
distance away from the center of the galaxy this is basically another way to say the stars of the 
you expect them to rotate a lot slower than the stars in the center if all the mass that 
there is just based on the stars that you see but what has been done in a lot of 
and in particular in the work of vera rubin in the is that stars on the edges are rotating 
much at the same speed to the stars closer to the center which is very bizarre ln it means 
either you you have about two ways to go you either have to change the laws of gravity or 
have to add that there is something there that has mass and it is contributing to the gravity of 
system and of your galaxy but you just see it and these are like the two major trains of 
here sc okay so what is to stop me from saying that just something we understand about gravity after 
gravity is very weak and talking about the size of a galaxy never been there never visited distances that 
away ln right and so if you only have the dynamics right you can actually build and some people 
build you know the decent theory of gravity that would explain these kind of distributions and these changes however 
are a lot of other things that we need to take into account so your theory has to explainpredict 
observations or observables for example one of them is basically the paraspectrum of the cosmic microwave background which is 
lot of words sc a lot a words ln and this is it is a lot of words but 
what happened is that if we kinda go back and do a brief history of time the universe started 
very hot and then as the universe expanded it was cooling so we were forming more and more bound 
and as we were doing that at some point a lot of the electrons or all the electrons actually 
with protons to become hydrogen and then the universe was kind of like all of a sudden neutral which 
that light can go through without hitting anything if the electrons and the protons are all over the place 
whatever if you have light it will kind of get it will get absorbed by all of these particles 
anyways so basically at about years after the big bang after the beginning of the universe there was light 
and interestingly enough it is light that we can actually detect now interestingly imprints or properties and you know 
fluctuations in that what we call the cosmic microwave background or cmb really tells us about the initial structures 
this is one of the most precise measurements that we have in modern astronomy astrophysics actually sc these are 
famous pictures we see right of like the ellipse with the green and red colors etcetera of the background 
right yes the interesting thing that we can get out of the cmb is basically the origin of matter 
galaxies and basically the original size of the galaxies one thing that a theory of dark matter does explain 
well is how much what is the amount of dark matter that we can see there that was initially 
is not out of the matter budget of the things that made of ln so definitely we know because 
this very precise measurement we know that of the matter budget of the universe is part of this dark 
that is different from the state of matter different from electrons different from protons different from what makes the 
and our iphones and all of the stuff that we already know it has to be something there that 
of measurement is a little bit difficult to make up just with a theory and with the new theory 
gravity and why i work on dark matter chuckle ln and alex and i disagree but yeah so what 
to say is that there are a lot of other observables the cmb is just one of them that 
of push for more of this theory that there is something else that is there sc yeah no i 
agree and i think that a lot of people who are dark matter skeptics are a little bit stuck 
the thinking that all they have to do is to explain the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and they 
declare victory over dark matter but these days a lot more data from a lot of completely different sources 
points in exactly the same direction ln absolutely exactly i think there are a lot of these wonderful reviews 
kind and been to a talk that actually kind of numbered them and there were i think fourteen different 
that the speaker was mentioning all from these different mechanisms or different scales from galaxy clusters to smaller galaxies 
just the milky way etcetera that kind of all pointing to a direction that there is a new particle 
is something there maybe it have to be like a particle particle but there is some new species of 
that we call dark matter now and that can explain all of this sc well the other thing right 
but they started figuring it out sc yeah the point here is not just some stars that are dark 
you know some planets or something like that we have reason to believe that a different kind of thing 
that right ln right so whatever it is it has very small probability to interact with the standard model 
made out of different things there has been a lot of these theories about yes being exactly that like 
dim stars and these ended up being called machos which stands for sc massive compact halo objects ln thank 
chuckle machos there are a lot of these experiments that actually ruled out different scales of machos and that 
of tells us that not just some object that is just a star that is just way too dim 
we see it that contributes to the mass yeah something else sc but it could be black holes right 
yes it could be primordial black holes there has been a lot of work especially recently on trying to 
what is the possibility or what is the parameter space so is the theory of primordial black holes explaining 
matter still possible there is some disagreement within the community of how much of it is ruled out the 
is not completely ruled out but quite a few chunks of it are it depends on the measurements and 
are some very small windows for example i think fifteen to thirty solar masses is still possible something like 
so it is not a completely ruled out theory ln it also could be or it is even more 
that primordial black holes would make up a fraction of what we call dark matter and then the rest 
else the way that we think about dark matter of course you have to think about the simplest thing 
you think the one thing but honestly it could be a composite set of things for in the we 
it was neutrinos and i know physicist who says like on people we have to say that neutrinos are 
part of the dark matter because yes they are laughter sc they exist and dark ln exactly just that 
very small fraction they cannot explain all the dark matter that we have sc well yeah working our way 
from the weirdest theories to the most popular ones modifying gravity by itself work gravity might be different on 
scales but not enough to explain all of the data that the dark matter does black holes you seem 
be saying if i can summarize it that if there is some mechanism for making black holes early on 
could be some of the dark matter but hard to make them be all of it is that fair 
right yes much more difficult to make them pure to make them all completely the dark matter it could 
a small fraction that has not been ruled out yes sc and what kind of experiments how would you 
how do you test that ln a lot of these experiments looking for a primordial black holes are basically 
gravitational lensing on different scales gravitational lensing is basically that if you have something very very massive between you 
an object that actually emits a lot of light then the light is gonna get bent in different ways 
you would see in the sky are these beautiful rings i wanna say ring that tell you that there 
a mass so there are a variety of gravitational lensing on different scales like weak lensing microlensing etcetera ln 
or at least part of these methods are used to try to determine if there are a lot of 
primordial black holes or these black holes around for example you know how much dark matter there should be 
so for each mass range of black holes you would estimate how the number that you would see and 
you would kind of scan the sky and try to study the motion of stars and try to see 
there is this lensing because statistically based on the number that you would expect you would have to see 
of these rings and some of these evidence for weak lensing etcetera when you see that you can put 
bound on a specific mass and a specific fraction of these black holes sc so if the dark matter 
other words were little tiny subatomic particles be kind of distributed smoothly and they cause a lot of these 
events but if you lump a bunch of dark matter into a black hole it can sort of have 
bigger impact now and again and you would notice it ln exactly right if your dark matter is made 
of particles you have to adjust and have different ways of detecting it versus if it was black holes 
you can use these methods of weak lensing for particles for example there are three major methods or detection 
that been looking into colliders direct detection and indirect detection happy to go through what these are sc please 
yeah sorry just catch our breath the point is that most working astrophysicist or cosmologist think that not only 
their dark matter but something not in the standard model of particle physics something never found here on earth 
some kind of particle probably not all just black holes so the question is how could we test this 
of idea experimentally ln right and the interesting thing is that for different mass regions of whatever this particle 
different directions you have to have this lucky different set of experiments basically each one of your experiment is 
to be sensitive to some part of the parameter space of your dark matter the dark matter parameter space 
huge chuckle somewhere between forty and seventytwo orders of magnitude depends on how you count sc sorry what do 
mean by the parameter space of the dark matter ln imagine that trying to discover this object whatever it 
and assuming somewhere between a particle and a black hole and when talking about parameter space you want to 
one of the bigger question is what is mass what is the mass of this object because the mass 
going to tell you about how much of it there is you already know the mass density basically and 
when you figure out mass you have to understand how it interacts with everything else ln does it what 
call talk to the senior model or does it interact with it or is it just going through us 
basically completely invisible to it we know already that it has extremely weak interaction with the standard model but 
it weak or is it zero both of these are a possibility sc and we know weak just because 
would have noticed it already ln exactly chuckle by process of elimination we would have seen it already yep 
so i guess does it make sense to why we mention some candidates for what the dark matter could 
just so our listeners minds have tuned to well how would we go look for these particular ideas ln 
one of the most common ideas has been what we call wimps for weakly interacting massive particle wimps would 
up being in the mass of a one to a hundred gev that translates to somewhere between the mass 
a proton to a mass of i think gold atoms or something like that and this is just one 
that makes up all of the dark matter just one very simple particle and it has some small interaction 
the standard model and it is in that one particular mass range ln the reason that that mass range 
particularly appealing from a theoretical point of view is that it would have had some relation with the weak 
in the standard model but basically that is kind of the simplest idea really that you could come up 
and ergo very popular because much easier to test for example that would be one of these of course 
primordial black holes that we discussed earlier is also one of the candidates ln you can also think of 
or axionlike particles these particles basically can play a role in how the quarks get mass and there is 
basically they are motivated by theoretical needs and then they happen to be naturally very good candidates for dark 
as well and this is very attractive from a physics point of view because if you have a theory 
kind of fixes a lot like addresses many problems sc yeah solves two problems at once ln exactly so 
would do that sc so axions do that yeah ln yeah and they tend to be a lot lighter 
the wimps that i was talking about so well the qcd axions or like the axions that people think 
are going to be ending up somewhere in the ten to the minus six electron volts which is basically 
see chuckle ln kind trying to figure it out okay times lighter than a neutrino which not sure is 
say anything sc i think we can say yeah ten to the minus six electron volts for an axion 
a proton is ten to the plus nine electron volts so fifteen orders of magnitude in between ln exactly 
can see already that the different theories of dark matter have a wild different of masses actually the lightest 
that you can actually think of that is possible to be dark matter is a regime that we call 
dark matter and it is basically the smallest mass is ten to the minus twentytwo electron volts so something 
smaller than that sc right ln yeah so there are a lot of beautiful theories and then the question 
how can we find them sc do we take neutrinos seriously are there weird versions of neutrinos that could 
the dark matter ln there are serious searches for not our neutrino our three neutrinos are fine but if 
is a sterile neutrino a fourth neutrino it could have like a bigger high mass because then you would 
to solve the problem of neutrino masses which is a bit different in brief we have this theory of 
model that kinda tells us about the particles that made of and their interactions and it is a very 
successful theory and it kind upsetting how successful it is from a theoretical physicist point of view because we 
to fail so you can figure out what else is missing but one of the things that it address 
neutrino masses trying to figure out how you can give neutrinos masses and maybe sort that out into the 
world of dark matter that is also a possibility sc okay so we have besides the black holes we 
wimps which someone just invented right not in the standard model they are extra particles that would be fun 
have ln yes yep sc axions which were also invented for another reason to solve other problems in the 
model neutrinos which we actually know about but the ones that we know about be the dark matter we 
how heavy they are and they have the right masses so you need to invent a different kind of 
ln right exactly and the thing with neutrinos is a bit too hot which means that they are going 
too fast for their mass and having them being the that basically from their mass and their interactions if 
were all the dark matter they would have destroyed a lot of the structure that we see is just 
you can imagine that you have a clump of something and then the neutrinos are going so fast through 
they just break it apart that would not make a good theory of dark matter because the world is 
not broken apart yet chuckle sc but this is also just a crucial thing to appreciate in terms of 
the science of dark matter works there are a tremendous number of constraints not just like some dark stuff 
we know what it maybe quantum mechanics or something like that very very specific properties this better have and 
you do something simple like make mass too low so that too high temperature and fast then everything breaks 
not a good theory anymore ln absolutely and funny because as a grad student a couple of my earlier 
were to kinda build a new theory of dark matter and trust me a lot harder than it sounds 
ln there are a lot of constraints and whatever theory you can come up with has to has to 
be ruled out by existing experiments which actually were quite a lot so yes and we know enough true 
we know what not in a lot of different ways and i think that kind more of a detective 
which i think is really fun and you try to kind of piece it up together because whatever dark 
is at the end of the day is going to satisfy all of these observables and getting there is 
to be absolutely amazing sc and you also said something that i think is very provocative so circle back 
it that you want the standard model of particle physics to fail and this surprises me on the internet 
read that establishment scientists are not open to new ideas and they just want to prop up the ideas 
already have but telling me you want your theory to fail that sounds weird chuckle ln yes so we 
that the standard model that we have is incomplete well already mentioned for example it does not have a 
of neutrino masses sc there you go ln and we know that what we call an effective field theory 
it addresses a it is valid up to a certain energy but not beyond so for example we know 
it address quantum gravity in any way but even simpler than neutrino masses so the theory is incomplete and 
when it breaks you would have a hint of what it is that you need to address and what 
is that you need to fix i think physicists are not open to new ideas if anything they come 
with way too many ideas laughter ln very hard to keep track of so yeah everybody i think when 
fails going to be the most exciting for the field because when we know the hint these are the 
that go wrong what we have missing in our theory and this is what we need to sc to 
perfectly honest we were kind of hopeful that would happen at the large hadron collider and so far it 
not ln absolutely so now every time our experimentalist friends would show up new plots and like the standard 
is right and you think like laughter ln but it is an amazing theory and extremely successful and incredible 
it can actually make so many predictions of so many observables and interactions that it can explain so beautifully 
we know for a fact definitely not complete and it happened in the large hadron collider but it will 
at some experiment at some energy scale at some point it will definitely fail and i think that would 
quite an interesting hint for physics and what to do next sc yeah no a very strange situation to 
in where your theory fits all the data and sure that wrong right laughter a little bit frustrating you 
any clues as to how to move on but speaking of moving on we have some evidence that dark 
exists we have some candidates for what it could be and then i interrupted you but you were going 
tell us the different ways we can actually experimentally probe what the dark matter is ln right since we 
just talking about the large hadron collider or what we call collider searches that is one of the ways 
we can detect dark matter and basically you would in these colliders what you do is actually collide protons 
and that kind of energy build or colliding them at very very high energies is going to produce a 
of different particles and at some point you might produce a dark matter so there are a lot of 
searches that looking for the dark matter then you might say okay how am i gonna see this because 
interact very much with the standard model particles with the particles that i and the way that you would 
it is actually would be beautiful because you would see what we call missing energy in your detector ln 
basically we know of our conservation of energy and conservation of momentum so what you get at the end 
the day is a stream of particles going one way and then nothing to balance it out on the 
side it means that you have something that is dark but it has to be there because of conservation 
momentum of course the catch there is that neutrinos do that too chuckle so you have to eliminate the 
part but other than that that would be an interesting way of looking for dark matter sc i mean 
you can see why people on the street become a little dubious saying that going to detect the existence 
dark matter by looking for missing energy looking for something that you see by not seeing something else somewhere 
ln right i think it is interesting but it also balances out kind of okay so if you were 
by a park and then you see somebody sitting on a seesaw and then the other side is completely 
but the seesaw is not really completely tipped like something is sketchy chuckle either the seesaw is broken or 
is something else that i just see sitting on the other side this is a little bit of the 
logic here where there is either your interactions are broken and the theory is broken or there is something 
coming out on the other side that you just see and this is what trying to figure out what 
is missing sc and the idea of there being missing energy in events at a particle accelerator that sounds 
something which we might creep up on gradually rather than discovering something and just a big plot and you 
the particle that you found this is something just slugging through and collecting more data and doing this for 
and years might be the way to get it is that the right way to think about it ln 
basically what you would make is try a lot of these methods are based on statistics and large statistics 
what you would try to do is actually put all of these events that looks somewhat the same together 
try to see if that missing energy has a common mass or common properties that keep creeping up not 
a failure of your detector that is just missing a spot there so yes a lot of it is 
on statistics especially because there are so many events in the large hadron collider and going to increase even 
in the next generation which is called lhc high luminosity large hadron collider ln it is an amazing piece 
experimental physics in general to be able to reconstruct all of that especially so fast but yes you need 
and why a lot of these experiments we run them for quite a long time to be able to 
the interesting events from what we call background which is standard model and also interesting in its own right 
different sc okay if not lucky enough to get evidence directly in an experiment like we build like the 
hadron collider what else can we do to look for the dark matter ln then we can go into 
we call direct detection so you wanna detect it directly how does this work you have huge tanks of 
different material but the most common one is really xenon so you we have a huge tank of xenon 
a few tons of xenon that you put in a huge tank and then you put it very very 
underground for example some of the experiments are usually deep in mine shafts and everything then you so then 
xenon is just sitting there and waiting for one dark matter particle out of the many that might be 
through your experiment one of them to hopefully interact by when it interacts with that xenon and it knocks 
off just a little that it will knock out one of electrons and you put the whole thing in 
electric field and that electron is going to kind of get pulled to the top of the experiment and 
you know that something hit ln so there are few things here first why do you need this to 
deep underground well because there are always background there are always something else that might hit your experiment and 
this particular case we call these cosmic rays or cosmic muons there are a lot of particles that hit 
atmosphere all the time and they make a lot of other particles like pions and muons and everything and 
muons are actually going through us all the time because coming out of our atmosphere and they usually do 
even though i well i recently discovered that there is actually a whole set of research about cosmic muons 
bits in computer clusters and that they need to kind of correct for that which is absolutely amazing anyways 
i think they also do sometimes cause dna mutations ln oh they oh yeah sc i think ln that 
really cool i sc not completely sure about this but cosmic rays do help your dna mutate so there 
go the ln yeah muons sc they seem so innocuous and ln but they do a lot of things 
yeah ln that is pretty cool but yeah they could also hit your experiment and then like i discovered 
matter oh nevermind these are the atmospheric and why you put your experiment very very deep underground where all 
dirt usually you put them sometimes under mountaintops and everything all these mountains are going to absorb a lot 
these cosmic muons and they would not interfere with your experiment sc right okay and is this good for 
of all kinds of dark matter detection or are we looking for some kinds of dark matter but not 
ln this would actually work mainly for wimps although there are new new techniques that instead of the xenon 
would choose different materials like for example helium in a lot of semiconductors and superconductor material and that would 
them kind of explore masses below the wimps but the standard large experiment like this is going to be 
addressing the wimps which is the one to one hundred gev or gigaelectronvolt mass range so yeah sc right 
my impression is these experiments have started been going on and we could have gotten lucky by now right 
could have actually seen the wimps by now but nowhere near finished looking for where they might be ln 
a lot of people are actually kind of getting stressedthinking that maybe wimps are not the way to go 
yes direct detection experiments have been going on for a while and been building bigger and better experiments i 
ruling out huge swaths of parameter space and the dark matter is not there yet and interestingly enough actually 
these experiments are going to be so good that they are going to be hitting something that we call 
neutrino floor and basically going to see neutrinos instead of the dark matter and this is incredible because these 
very very small crosssections that you see with this type of set up actually yet so yeah if anything 
solar neutrinos again in a different experiment sc so the like neutrino static in your radio chuckle ln right 
like that background that when you yeah you get to it and then all of a sudden going to 
your background because direct detection experiments so far have been running pretty much background sc yeah ln nothing is 
gonna get through a mile of earth to get to your experiment and actually hit it you have to 
a bit careful about the material that using for your experiment sometimes some material radiates a little bit so 
have to be very very clean and again my hat to experimentalists they build amazing things but other than 
yeah we seen dark matter yet unfortunately sc and you know to be honest full disclosure here the other 
thing looming over us right we seen any new particles at the large hadron collider we also detected the 
at these underground experiments and in some sense they went handinhand right i mean physics arranges itself by what 
masses of the particles are and the sort of mass range the lhc is looking at is the same 
the mass range that the wimp detectors are looking at and everyone expected to see something there and we 
a little bit of back to the drawing board time ln absolutely i think it has filled kind of 
field with a bit of disappointment in trying to figure out exactly where to go from there and what 
the new strategies i think it is kind i think a good thing to do in the sense that 
of more of a call for creativity and a lot of people are kind of adopting that like from 
the theoretical and the experimental sides where you try to think of definitely new theories that could explain all 
these observables because you know when you see nothing that is an observable because that means ruling out something 
really just that it was waste no really not ln so whatever your theory is has to actually explain 
this these null results so you really have to be very very creative there but also from an experimental 
of view you need to figure out new technologies and new experiments to probe different masses and think of 
that nobody else has built before and i know i think all of this kind of makes physics really 
fun even though of course you would want something to work in the end and you would want to 
new things of course but really looking at physics from a new way i think very exciting but this 
why i do what i do sc yeah of course but and also just to be fair on the 
side if the dark matter is axions we have a hope of seeing them at these underground experiments we 
to use some completely different technique right ln right and there have been quite a few of these experiments 
well with axions for example what you would wanna do is build a helioscope so basically trying to how 
do i put this you try to kind of have this experiment where an axion is going to kind 
make some resonance actually okay differently these are very different scale experiments so remember talking about like multiple tons 
xenon these are actually a lot smaller and the axioms are going to get into your experiment and actually 
a electromagnetic field that you would detect so something like that yeah ln which is a completely different set 
experiment and this is a different completely different mechanism and they have been kind of doing quite a good 
at ruling out different parameter space of course again different masses of possible axions but that space is very 
large sc yeah no my impression is that unlike the wimp case where we really have ruled out a 
fraction of the parameter space in the axion case still a lot of room to be explored ln absolutely 
these experiments are very difficult and kind of tracking very very small mass basically mass windows very very thin 
at every time that running your experiment unlike these wimp indirect detection where you can pull out a huge 
of the parameter space all at once yes sc and so the last thing that you mentioned was indirect 
so if you detect them directly why not try indirectly ln right indirect detection has a funny name but 
it means that dark matter is going to either annihilate or decay into particles that we already know and 
we see those particles so said another way you can imagine that the dark matter just annihilates at the 
of the galaxy into electrons positrons neutrinos gamma rays all of the above and then what you would see 
from your gammaray telescope for example is that there is an excess of gamma rays coming from the center 
the galaxy that you just explain like wait i expected a lot lower number of these gamma rays why 
i seeing that many that could be a dark matter of course it also could be astrophysics as learned 
sc wait wait wait i think for the people on the street you have to explain what that means 
course it could be astrophysics this is all astrophysics ln it is all astrophysics true so when i think 
is physics slang for it could be something that we already know but not really basically back well it 
in two thousand nine where so there is this telescopes it is called fermi telescope and it basically measures 
gamma rays in the sky and in two thousand nine was the first evidence that there was a little 
more gamma rays for in the range of masses from like one to three gev or so in the 
of the galaxy then with more data and as we talked about earlier you gather more statistics in sc 
sorry i need to interrupt here too because i think doing another physicist shortcut because you said gamma rays 
the range of masses around one gev or whatever but of course the gamma rays are photons and massless 
using e mc squared right ln right sorry thank you for pointing that out yes chuckle sc they are 
energies that you would get by annihilating a particle with a mass of that much ln yes exactly right 
physics i think your first day at grad school they tell you e mc squared and c equals one 
you just go from there laughter and you kind of never go back but yes the photons are indeed 
but these are kind of equivalent energy that they would have absolutely based on that relation yeah and then 
two thousand fourteen with gathering more and more statistics it was even more evident that there is some access 
that ended up being called the galactic center access so why is the galactic center actually interesting at all 
well you would expect within what are current theories of dark matter you would expect that there is a 
higher density of dark matter in the center of the galaxy you can think of it as like a 
potential well that your gas and stars are kind of like falling into and so if you if the 
matter was to annihilate or decay or do something it would be where there is the most of it 
is at the center of the galaxy so this so far was consistent sc right ln then there is 
excess of gamma rays that we try to figure out and we were like ooh that would be interesting 
that really dark the first thing that you would check for example is what is the spatial distribution of 
gamma rays which means is my signal coming from everywhere in the galactic center or is it correlated with 
stars and in the disc does it have like a shape of some sort you expect the dark matter 
have some weird shape ln the first test that ended up that the signal was isotropic which means that 
uniform coming from the sky so cool then you were like that might really be dark matter but then 
try to think of what else could it be which is and this is the toughest part with indirect 
you always have to say what else could it be ln then the other competing theory it could be 
you have a lot of pulsars which are just these neutral stars that just turn really really fast and 
a lot of these gamma rays that you see otherwise that you have seen detected previously and then the 
is is it pulsars or is it that dark and you have to estimate how many pulsars you have 
in the center of the galaxy which is pretty far and then based on a lot of things that 
know i think that the status of it right now is that it might probably mostly pulsars all those 
are confirmed chuckle ln yeah we need to at least see some of these pulsars so the way you 
do it is by seeing it in radio telescopes but you really see huge parts of the sky all 
once in radio telescopes so yeah this is the fun of physics trying to figure out investigative work basically 
it does make sense in retrospect you are hoping to see signals of dark matter at the center of 
galaxy because where you should have a high density of dark matter but also a high density of other 
stuff at the center of the galaxy and realizing we were not quite as careful as we could have 
figuring out what the signal should be from that other weird stuff that is weird but not nearly as 
as dark matter ln exactly right and so then you can go for option b okay if the galactic 
is too messy where else can i see it and then you might be able to say something about 
galaxies so what are these we have our galaxy the milky way and we are sitting pretty much at 
edge of a disc of the milky way but the milky way is actually much larger and swimming in 
we call the dark matter halo basically a sphere of dark matter more or less that you can think 
ln anyway it has a lot of gravitational pull because it is a pretty big galaxy and because of 
gravitational pull it also pulled smaller galaxies very close to it and these are kind of satellite galaxies the 
way that the moon is the satellite of the earth more or less ln we have that this milky 
has own small satellites that we called call dwarf galaxies which are galaxies but a lot smaller anyways these 
galaxies have a lot less baryons or a lot less stars and gas than the center of the galaxy 
means that if you see signal from them probably actually coming out of the dark matter so they have 
we call the mass to light ratio they have a lot of mass coming from dark matter and very 
light coming from stars unlike the milky way that has a pretty high mass to light ratio pretty low 
to light ratio sc so we think that in dwarf galaxies less chance be confused by pulsars or other 
things ln exactly right the problem is that much smaller so they have a lot lesser matter right sc 
ln so what we can do and what we do is we can stack them so basically trying to 
for example the gamma rays from a lot of these dwarf galaxies and put them together on top of 
other stack them and try to see is there something significant there do we really see an access of 
matter and then the status of things is that there was one dwarf galaxy that might have had an 
there was nothing confirmed and a lot of my current work is trying to better understand how much dark 
should we expect in these galaxies because a very difficult measurement that we have to do so yeah there 
a lot to be done in physics basically sc so okay but this is good for the people listening 
have some data is the constraint that you have enough data of gamma rays from these dwarf galaxies yet 
that we analyzed them carefully enough or that we understand the background astrophysics ln we have a lot of 
here just it is not about the background of astrophysics expect that to be small basically how much dark 
do you expect in dwarf galaxies all together and a very tough measurement or between quotes that you have 
make the same way how much dark matter there is at the center of the galaxy is still a 
question ln so focus on dwarf galaxies because they are bit simpler how would you know how much dark 
there is in a galaxy like that well the only measurement that we have is really based on the 
of stars and this is not motion so i really see all the directions of motion of these stars 
i see is what we call the lineofsight velocity that basically is basically the doppler shift is that star 
away from me or is it coming towards me and with what velocity i can make those measurements about 
stars and usually just the bright ones so not all of them of these objects and then have some 
about okay these stars are moving within a certain speed what is the amount of mass that would give 
would be consistent with such a speed ln so the thing is there are a lot of things that 
go wrong there basically you know since only seeing one direction of the motion of stars basically is it 
towards me or away from me you know the sideways motions and hard to tell you have missing information 
motion could be very large or very small and you know so you really know the fullvelocity of that 
hard to get the full mass ln you of course have to assume that the system is in equilibrium 
that means that there is nothing weird happening to your stars not getting pulled or pushed by something else 
particular for example the gravitational field of the milky way is not doing anything to them you have to 
that the whole thing is a sphere it have to be this kinda goes back to the joke of 
spherical cow in a vacuum chuckle sc the spherical cow galaxy okay good yes ln right there are a 
we know some something about the mass of these objects but we need to know them much much better 
be able to rule things out or rule things in with much more confidence sc and so what are 
prospects gonna happen for one thing you mentioned the fermi gammaray telescope tell us about that in space right 
to build a gammaray telescope here on earth but it is possible ln right this is a gammaray telescope 
is in space and the reason that much more difficult to have these things on earth is because the 
is really really painful to get through for earthlike experiments you can actually do get some gamma rays but 
very very high energies and they are these what we call cherenkov telescopes so basically these telescopes in the 
i think some of them are in the desert in africa and basically what they have is a gamma 
that is very very energetic comes in and then of course it interacts and makes a shower of particles 
get those through the experiment and they end up moving in the medium of the experiment usually water faster 
the speed of light in water nothing goes faster than the speed of light in a vacuum but in 
it actually can happen sc right ln and how you would see these but yes the prospect so fermi 
gathered a lot of amazing data and actually it has given us for example catalogues where we felt like 
gamma ray catalogues of a lot of things that are in the milky way and even a bit further 
actually emit gamma rays it is definitely a great way to understand the astrophysics of the milky way another 
and the milky way and its surroundings but the reason that i think the world of astrophysics or astroparticle 
is really really interesting and in it for a ride is of all the experiments and all the telescopes 
are gonna come in online and have come in online ln there is the vera rubin telescope called a 
of coming in there are other upgrades of current experiments but the one most excited about and a lot 
my work is on is called gaia and gaia is this space telescope that was launched in december two 
thirteen with a goal of giving us the positional measurements so the motion and distances of one billion stars 
this is one percent of the milky way yes how it works sc so yeah since younger than me 
forget but when i was your age we were excited about the hipparcos satellite and this was a satellite 
was gonna get i guess thousands of stars their distances and their sideways motions ln right hipparcos ran from 
and it was very exciting but amazing when you see the map of how much gaia covers now compared 
hipparcos and yeah a lot of people get offended like was a great like not saying anything else but 
is amazing sc yeah but just to see how amazing it is really hard to know how far away 
are you can see where they are in the sky but this amazing technological achievement to also measure the 
to a billion stars ln absolutely and their distances and their motion really now you for the first time 
can actually have maps of to be fair now still just the closest stars absolutely incredible the amount of 
that getting the second data release of gaia was back in april almost two years ago from april and 
so one billion stars their distances and their motion that we call proper motion but a subset of them 
also had the line of sight velocity that i talked about earlier so for a subset a very small 
of seven million stars we actually have kinematics absolutely incredible and an amazing dataset that you can get so 
out of and indeed we did back in a new merger of stars has been discovered based on the 
of stars let me explain what mergers are sc yeah ln basically remember earlier i said that we have 
satellites because the milky way is kind of pulling a lot of these small satellite into it sc uhhuh 
well the satellites they have stars and dark matter but sometimes they crash into us and we pull them 
fast so they would just get completely disrupted completely destroyed and get mixed up with the milky way so 
discovery of two thousand eighteen is that there is such a merger that has happened somewhere between six and 
billion years ago and smashed into our galaxy brought in so many stars with it and interesting because a 
big object mass was somewhere between and the mass of the milky way and we never knew it was 
until we actually finally had the kinematic data for it it has a very unfortunate name because of the 
who first saw it called it the gaia sausage sc because it is roughly sausage shaped after ln because 
is extended yes but we still give that person help every time sc okay the gaia sausage yeah i 
gaia just seems like greek mythology very highbrow and then it was like making sausage okay ln right so 
belokurov is the person you should blame chuckle an incredible physicist and he saw it and he saw the 
it was a bit sausagey so he went with that name after the fact there were attempts at calling 
the gaia enceladus and the enceladus is a greek god the son of gaia which is amazing but unfortunate 
everybody will remember only the sausage so it sticks so i think maybe who knows there was something good 
sc so what could we learn about dark matter from seeing this sausageshaped collection of stars that has been 
by the milky way ln right where what i do comes in chuckle a lot of the things that 
doing is trying to understand how much dark matter would come from these mergers and answer the question i 
how fast the dark matter is going based on the speed of these stars when they merge so what 
do is actually use simulations a lot of them i in part actually developed here at caltech from phil 
group these simulations are called fire which actually is an acronym for feedback in realistic environment but the reason 
really cool is because we can make a lot of fire puns for the titles of our paper chuckle 
physicists are just the worse no pun they cannot possibly resist ln i know we just really help it 
sc yeah right chuckle ln so yeah what i did is actually i used a lot of these simulations 
simulations are actually simulate what building a galaxy just like the milky way really really cool what you do 
like you start the really really early times you have your dark matter particles and you teach them gravity 
then you also add in beauty of the fire group the physics that has been brought in by the 
group is to add a lot of these physics of the gas interactions and the stars etcetera on top 
that and then you let you just like teach it different interactions and you just let that evolve from 
early on and at the end of the day thirteen billion years later you end up with a galaxy 
looks very much like the milky way not exactly the same obviously but it has the same properties in 
sense that you end up with a this galaxy it has a proper mass etcetera and this is absolutely 
ln the cool thing about these simulations and the reason that i really love using them is that i 
that i can track the stars and i can track the dark matter basically particle by particle to figure 
exactly going to land in the sun or the position of where the sun would be in these simulations 
then figure out if there are correlations if there are any relationship between the dark matter and the stars 
where they came from etcetera and what would i expect to see in my experiments today there was a 
sc and when you just to be clear when you say you can track every particle this is not 
elementary particles like proton this is the particle in this simulation that is used to model a whole bunch 
mass ln right unfortunately we cannot just like simulate the whole galaxy up to you know electrons we overlapping 
sc not really realistic yes ln so what we do is that we call these particles in our simulation 
these are actually like huge clumps of dark matter and clumps of stars for example the stars and what 
call one star in the simulation it really has seven thousand solar masses so basically about seven thousand stars 
up together because where the resolution is going to be sc yeah a low resolution version of the galaxy 
think that makes perfect sense in our modern video gaming era people know what that means chuckle ln exactly 
sc but the nice thing then is we can really appreciate the fact that since we do believe in 
matter since not just modified gravity the dark matter is located somewhere and the distribution is kind of lumpy 
has structure and is interesting for better and for worse right ln absolutely and i think this i think 
really fun because it plays the reason that i do this is because it plays into the experiments that 
were discussing earlier so the lumpiness of dark matter it means that you might have an excess of gamma 
coming from those lumpiness or if the dark matter is faster or slower that would affect how many of 
you would see in direct detection experiments in the tanks of xenon underground because the faster the dark matter 
more energy it might deposit in the xenons so it all is very much correlated at these very different 
which i find absolutely fascinating because the theory of dark matter really at essence is a theory of astrophysics 
very large scales but also particle physics in the smaller scales and everything has to make sense and i 
ln i can keep talking about dark matter all day but i find this absolutely fascinating sc so i 
what have we learned by knowing that there is a sausage there other structures or whatever what are the 
for trying and detect the dark matter and finally finding it ln right basically trying to extrapolate the dark 
velocity for example based on the velocity of the stars from the gaia sausage one thing we found out 
it might the stars and then consequently the dark matter might be going a bit slower than we would 
which means that we might have been ruling out more parameter space and saying that this dark matter cannot 
more than we should have so we kind of have to go back and really address all of these 
and making sure that our initial models that are not really empirical they are just based on assuming that 
milky way is relaxed and everything is sc yeah ln we realized that no the milky way has quite 
interesting structure than we thought before and we need to take that into account in our experiments one thing 
is quite interesting that i found last year with my amazing collaborator brian ostic who is a post doc 
harvard basically he was trying he was building this machine learning methods trying to figure out which stars did 
come from the milky way and this is absolutely amazing then he built this wonderful catalog and then he 
it to me and he was like know what looking at this is the catalog star the stars just 
i was like i can do laughter ln this is gonna be great then the first thing that you 
really when you get a catalog or any data set is that you start plotting it and you just 
random plots and figure out does it look like i expect it to does it not sc take your 
for it laughter ln yes i might be a little bit less theory i do use data anyway i 
plotting these and the gaia sausage was there just there without me having to look for it and i 
like is but then there was this other cluttered clump of stars that was not supposed to be there 
when young and watching movies and everything you just think that yeah if i see something amazing gonna have 
eureka moment and like oh this is but then you go to grad school and you realize that every 
like that is just a bug in your code and sc yeah i know so many eureka moments that 
see the light of day true ln exactly so of course as a welltrained failed grad student laughter that 
the first thing that kinda came to mind so i sit on it for three weeks and i tell 
of my collaborators i was plotting it every which way but then i realized it might not be a 
it was this actually might be something which is really and then you have to actually check against literature 
like it might be something that somebody else has already found in which case sc sure ln thankfully nobody 
has found that one so i got to name it which is really cool sc the best ln this 
cool called nyx nyx for greek goddess of the night that i thought was particularly fitting here but what 
we learn from this so nyx is a clump of stars that are rotating with the sun these are 
that are very close corotating but they also kind of have this wave of movement towards the center of 
galaxy which is very bizarre because you expect them to do that then there are these two theories that 
could think of that would explain this either something hit the milky way and kinda caused these waves and 
stars are kind of getting pushed just imagine you if you have a lake and throwing a rock in 
and then gonna cause waves and the stars are just moving that way ln or a merger just like 
sausage so another object that just fell into the milky way and these stars that i see here are 
remnant of this merger the interesting thing is that if it is indeed a merger it might have also 
in with it a lot of dark matter that would have formed something called the dark disk something that 
kind of corotating with us and that would change our estimates of direct interjection quite a lot actually so 
trying to figure out what it is but if but definitely really fun sc so this is something that 
get confused about so maybe help the audience in some sense we hope that there is less dark matter 
us than we think because we have a certain threshold that ruled out right of a number of events 
our detectors etcetera and if more dark matter than we think that means that the parameter space is even 
right the parameter space is even more constrained by our experiment more wiggle room if less dark matter around 
that the way it goes did i get it right ln right if dark matter is a lot less 
a lot of more of our theories are still possible sc yeah ln however if the dark for example 
the dark matter is coming out of a dark disk if it has a nontrivial velocity distribution then the 
of those limits that we see in the literature is actually quite different because this new structure is going 
affect very high masses but not going to affect lowmass dark matter usually these flaws that we are ruling 
might actually look quite different not just like an overall scaling not oh more of it or less of 
is going to be ruled out just that the shape the mass versus the probability that would detect it 
look quite different which would be very interesting sc right so gaia because given us this map of a 
stars is helping us figure out this interplay between the location of dark matter in the galaxy and our 
to constrain its properties here on earth ln right so the it only has a billion stars basically with 
motion so the side way motion sc right ln and the parallax and only a subset of seven million 
them that has velocities but for the third data release of gaia which is scheduled for next year with 
delays for now but going to go from that seven million up to one hundred to one hundred fifty 
going to be amazing whatever gonna get laughter ln very excited for that so yeah we can do that 
can also not the only thing that we can get out of gaia there are what we call in 
process of pulling the satellites they end up forming streams in the sky so basically stars are kind of 
aligned and using gaia for example we can actually see gaps in these streams and there is one of 
streams called gd that has a couple of gaps and then the question is how do you explain gaps 
these streams sc yeah ln and one of these theories is that if you have a clump of dark 
that just goes right through your stream and pulls a lot of stars with it then that means how 
would get one of these gaps in your stream which we can see with gaia and the question is 
big is that clump what is it how fast it was going etcetera really helps you narrow down the 
of dark matter that you have because some theories of dark matter for example would not have very low 
clumps and if you see a very low mass clump it means that that theory is not right sc 
sorry what kind of theories of dark matter would not have a low mass clumps ln something that we 
warm dark matter and even theories of selfinteracting dark matter but focus on the warm dark matter remember earlier 
i said that neutrinos are going too fast so they destroy a lot of the structures that they have 
of having something as hot as neutrinos if you have your dark matter that is a bit warm which 
that going a little bit too fast but not extremely fast then it will destroy very very small galaxies 
sound like galaxies just by going through them and puncturing them and basically heating up the system is what 
call it in astrophysics but not gonna make much of a difference to larger objects which means that these 
are not going to allow small enough clumps sc right got it ln what we call cutting the power 
then the question is the gaps that you see are they consistent with very very small clumps and if 
they would rule out models of warm dark matter for example sc got it okay good yeah alright so 
this very exciting frontier set of prospects about the new data coming in and teaching us about dark matter 
before we can directly detect it but therefore i feel like done our duty and we can let our 
down a little bit now you already mentioned that the idea of selfinteracting dark matter all of this dark 
stuff that been talking about all the ideas for it had roughly speaking been that the dark matter is 
there it might be in different places it might be different densities it might be different velocities but it 
anything other than move under the force of gravity but now introducing the possibility that the dark matter could 
more interesting it could interact with itself or dark energy or something or ordinary matter in interesting ways ln 
it could have own selfinteractions along with any interaction that it might have with the cini model without particles 
one thing that is a particle physicist nightmare is that what if dark matter does not interact with us 
all how can we possibly see it ln well if it has own selfinteraction which means that yes it 
with gravity a given with dark matter but what if it interacts with each other like two dark matter 
they bounce of each other they scatter of each other annihilate into more dark matter etcetera what would we 
well interestingly if that happens it means that the higher density point so the center of dwarf galaxies or 
center of the milky way is going to be a lot less dense and the reason for it is 
if there is a high density spot and interacting too much they will kind of kick each other out 
that would drop the density of that part and this is what we call the core versus cusp ln 
from simulations you would expect to have a cusp in the density of dark matter which means that the 
is very very steep that there is a lot of dark matter in the middle of galaxies in particular 
galaxies but if you add in selfinteraction that cusp becomes a core which means that instead of just going 
very very high as you go through to smaller and smaller distances from the center going to just become 
or less a constant or stable sc okay so a little smushed out a little bit more fluffy ln 
a bit smushed out that would be kind of a probe of seeing that dark matter is indeed there 
has some kind of properties even though it interact with the electrons and the protons etcetera so you would 
it from what we call from astrophysics or astrophysical probes sc do we have some preexisting feeling for whether 
not we should expect the dark matter to have interesting interactions with itself or is it just easier i 
this is sort of the only quasiscientific question like our feelings rather than what we can observe but we 
have bayesian priors on what we expect do you think that the dark matter interacts with itself in interesting 
ln i think so i think very unlikely it was not ruled out but very unlikely that the dark 
is just that one particle that has about oneonone interaction with the cini model way too simple especially giving 
how complex our standard model is i would expect that the dark matter sector and a whole sector not 
one particle for example is going to be complex going to have a very interesting interactions etcetera so yeah 
think i would not be surprised if the dark matter has some kind of selfinteraction and if a very 
sector in general than what we have i would be very surprised if it was just one chuckle i 
very simple sc yeah i ask in part because i honestly know myself written papers about interesting ideas for 
matter including one on dark electromagnetism where we can have dark magnetic fields and maybe even dark atoms and 
chemistry and things like that but i just know if more likely that it should be that way a 
different ways you could have interesting dark matter sectors or less likely because just an ugly complication that actually 
any puzzles ln yeah i think a very interesting question and i think one of those things that good 
people think differently because they will spend time doing different things but yeah rationally there is no out prior 
about this at all so something that we need to kind of track i think i would be very 
if very simple but just me chuckle sc well no like you said good that different people have different 
about this because ultimately gonna find out by doing the experiment and gonna figure it out and i think 
given us today a lot more reason to be optimistic that we will figure out i think you and 
me if wrong but your enthusiasm is contagious i think that excited about the prospect for learning more and 
about dark matter in the near future ln i tend to be very optimistic about this well and i 
love my job chuckle one of those things but yeah i know people were a little bit less optimistic 
is the most optimistic view you can get chuckle sc good no i asked the right person to be
