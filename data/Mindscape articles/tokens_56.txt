sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and as you know if 
listening to this podcast like to mention books that i have written or am in the process of writing 
most recent book that has actually appeared is of course called the big picture and it was an attempt 
put together the laws of the physical world with the human side of things and this is an element 
a genre right a kind of book where you try to synthesize some gigantic picture of things and yeah 
are successes and less successful books in this genre our guest today is nicholas christakis who is the author 
one of the most recent attempts in this genre it is called blueprint now nicholas unlike me is not 
physicist well hard to say what he is sc i almost say a social scientist but one of the 
he brings to the table as an author of an incredibly sprawling book like this is that he seems 
be a professor of everything he was originally a medical doctor and now i have to read this from 
back of his book he is at yale university the sterling professor of social and natural science and particularly 
in the departments of sociology medicine ecology evolutionary biology statistics and data science and biomedical engineering as well as 
the codirector of the yale institute for network science so a sociologist a medical doctor he studies ecology and 
applied math a whole bunch of things sc so in blueprint trying to put this all together trying to 
a book about humanity and what makes us special not just culturally but how that relates to our biology 
genetics how we came to be different than other animals in different ways and he identifies what he calls 
social suite the list of suite suite so a suite of characteristics that make us human and some of 
are good things like the capacity for love or cooperation some of them might not sound so good like 
existence of ingroup bias we like people like ourselves we like people not like ourselves the preference for hierarchies 
so forth but the overall message that he comes away with is an optimistic one what makes this book 
in a sense not simply saying how terrible human beings are saying that good reason to be optimistic about 
we can become sc and not a not at all determined he has examples in the book for example 
societies that were created after shipwrecks so little semicontrolled experiments with small numbers of people some of these experiments 
terribly wrong but some of them turned out really really well so nicholas wants to make the case that 
makes us human is part of what makes us good and we do have reason to be optimistic about 
future of course as long as we destroy the planet or anything like that so see how gonna happen 
go music sc nicholas christakis welcome to the mindscape podcast nicholas christakis thank you so much for having me 
sc so i do i wanna dive right in to the meaty substance written a book very very good 
quite reached the mark in any of my books come four hundred and some a couple of times but 
equally intrigued by the about the author section at the end of your book because you have an md 
phd been a hospice doctor and talked about as a sociologist tell us how you think about yourself and 
you got to be this nc oh goodness well said a little bit about the biographical details i think 
me one of the most interesting observations about the sciences or more generally about scholarly inquiry is that innovation 
novelty often come at the intersection of disciplines and this idea is often realized in many ways i talk 
my graduate students i say you have depth but also some breadth early go to nearby meetings and conferences 
departments and see what doing and never know when you get a good idea unexpectedly you might be building 
kind of a laser a laser device and go to a talk by a biologist about how natural selection 
solved a similar problem millions of years ago in the design of an insect eye for instance or the 
principal comes up when you think about civilizations and this wonderful lecture about when ideas have sex nc like 
come at the intersection of trade routes where people mix and ideas mix and i think the same thing 
in discovery not just a pedagogic tool not just an argument about the emergence of novelty and ideas at 
sort at the civilization level i think it happens at the level of a work of a practicing scientist 
if you cultivate some breadth in yourself able to discover new things so in my own career tried to 
that tried to be as broadly educated as i can be and i have rather enjoyed it sc and 
but let me play the part of the advocate here nc yes sc just cast this interdisciplinary nature of 
work as a sort of rational instrumental good thing to do so is it mostly that or is it 
that you just like it laughter nc both i derive a lot of thing is i first like most 
i think again i wanna emphasize that i think important to have expertise not advocating for being a dilettante 
think important to have skills to have depth but i also think important to keep your head up and 
around and people of different disciplines and different people do that at different phases of their career and in 
case i may have the investments in my in both the natural and the social sciences the biological and 
social sciences and i over the course of my career tried very hard to keep those parts alive and 
look for opportunities for discovery at the intersection of those fields so why for instance a lot of the 
been doing has been on the evolutionary biology of friendship for example sc right nc how and why did 
evolved to have friends a question at the overlap of those fields so been sort of deliberate sc yeah 
so come out with this wonderful new book called is it blueprint or the blueprint sorry i forgot nc 
sc blueprint nc right sc as i said yeah five hundred pages it has the feeling of a summing 
of many years both too young to have anything that is specifically the culmination of our career quite yet 
it does have this synthetic vibe to it so of course what going to ask you to do is 
summarize it in thirty seconds or less for our readers what is the point of the book the elevator 
nc well i think for too long in my view the social sciences and the biological sciences and the 
on the street have been obsessed with the role of our evolution in shaping our propensity for bad things 
propensity for violence and tribalism and selfishness and mendacity but equally natural selection has shaped us for good has 
equipped us with capacities for love and friendship and cooperation and teaching and i would argue that these qualities 
good qualities over the sweep of our evolution must necessarily have outweighed the bad qualities if every time i 
near you you killed me or you were mean to me you were mean to me or you filled 
with lies gave me fake news or information that was false about the world then there would be no 
in my being near you and we would evolve to be solitary animals but not social animals so the 
of a connected life must necessarily have outweighed the costs and the subsidiary ideas to that there are a 
of sort of motifs one of those is that to the extent that these core features are good and 
the extent that they have been shaped by natural selection they give us a kind of a lever or 
of insight into our common humanity nc the fact that humans around the world share these properties we all 
because all the same species they are seen again and again in the of core fundamental universal cultural set 
cultural universals which are a universal and b good so it gives us a kind of an opportunity to 
with each other and kind of address in some ways some of the forces that might otherwise divide us 
are modern political forces but not my main agenda so those are some of the themes of the role 
natural selection in shaping not just the structure and function of our bodies not just the structure and function 
our minds but the structure and function of our societies how have we been shaped across our evolution to 
particular forms of social order why are those forms of social order universal why are those forms of social 
good and what this is and how do they become to be that way so those are some of 
big ideas in the book sc yeah okay that was more than thirty seconds but okay a lot to 
in nc five hundred pages john sc i know but you gotta work on i live in hollywood you 
work on your elevator pitch nc yes yes so guns germs and steel meets better angels of our nature 
perfect there you go now thinking about studio deals okay good a fundamentally optimistic book right nc yes sc 
was it just because how the facts led you or do you think about it as coming into being 
a milieu of other discussions going on and you wanna push back against certain trends nc i would say 
i think that is where the facts led me and no doubt that also been shaped for all kinds 
awfulness and every century every millennium every epoch is replete with horrors warfare and pogroms and inquisitions and holocausts 
nuclear weapons and every other evil you can imagine incompetent leadership so true and in many of those propensities 
course are also part of our nature so part of it was my desire to focus on the good 
that is to say i directed my gaze there but part of it as well was the fact that 
think so much evidence about this that been given the due it deserves and that also been seen to 
those other qualities enough so where i was coming from sc no i think it makes perfect sense and 
so if anyone only gets to listen to the first ten minutes of the podcast i want them to 
the take home message here i think the central point of the book is what you call the social 
is that a fair thing to say nc yes sc so this is a list of eight things that 
well number one you say common to human beings in human societies and number two gonna attribute that commonality 
evolution to our genes nc yes sc not just accidents of history right nc correct and also very pertinently 
are specifically social qualities so for example not discussing in this book those attributes of our human nature that 
might manifest as isolated individuals sc right nc for example the way natural selection has shaped you to be 
or religious for instance you could do those on your own you could go through the world on your 
interested in those things that we necessarily must express between ourselves these things include things like love and friendship 
networks cooperation ingroup bias the preference of us versus them kind of mild hierarchy and the practice of teaching 
learning and the eighth element is this capacity for individual identity this ability that we have to express our 
which very paradoxically also lies at the core of our sociality sc very good you got them all you 
them in the right order that you put them in the book but you remembered all eight of them 
summarized them very very nicely so these are characteristics that human beings have that play a role in our 
world as you say and for the most part they sound good love and friendship and cooperation a couple 
there that so get to those is there a simple way of saying how you came upon this list 
eight was it a whole bunch of things and narrowed it down or did you keep adding as you 
more things nc well i suppose it could be like the standard model you chuckle first you find neutrons 
electrons and protons sc we should say that you have physicists in your family nc extensive yes chuckle sc 
can use the physics analogies all we want nc yes yeah so we first we find the electrons and 
protons and the neutrons and then we say a minute they are composed of quarks and subsidiary and eventually 
even get to antimatter so we got positrons so we could keep going down and down and i think 
suppose i would put this at the level of the first cut so neutrons protons and electrons these are 
complete set of things that i think can be used to define a social order as a first order 
now there are constituent elements in these things which i allude to but i go down and you might 
argue are more fundamental for example i talk about empathy but i include empathy as its own independent quality 
i talk about religion for instance but i include which we clearly natural selection has shaped our religious capabilities 
example but i include that because something you can express on your own you so again i narrow my 
to look at these types of things sc speaking of empathy i did have your yale colleague paul bloom 
the podcast antiempathy and i bravely took on the proempathy side do you have a dog in that particular 
nc well i think paul wonderful sc yeah we had a great talk nc his book is very provocatively 
and ingeniously titled he think empathy is bad sc i know nc i know you know so but very 
because he does make an argument about the downside of empathy and why as you point out so how 
you do in your argument with him in your debate with him laughter well i clearly won no he 
that i was right about everything no i think we had a very productive conversation in fact we disagree 
very little more a matter of emphasis than anything else his next book is about cruelty and i strongly 
him to call it praise of to keep up that contrarian banner but i think not gonna do that 
so as you say you have an interest in both the social sciences and the natural sciences and through 
research and through study come to this the social suite this list of common qualities that people have in 
social lives and that we can help to use these explain how cultures evolved but an obstacle to being 
good social scientist which is that you have a human being version of the particle accelerator right you do 
experiments quite as well nc or ligo sc yes exactly or ligo you have neither observatories nor colliders so 
do you you look at societies that exist but of course hard to find a control group there but 
have a couple of ingenious chapters on ways in which had more or less isolated experiments with human societies 
well we do a number of things first of all in my lab we and in many labs of 
we do do experiments frank experiments and one of the things done is written some software integrated with online 
markets and we can recruit we have recruited tens of thousands of people that come and participate in our 
and in a godlike way we can randomly assign them to different treatments and actually this was very much 
by my own background or education in the natural sciences we take for many of us remember from high 
physics the inclined plane experiment where you vary the angle theta and you put the weight on and then 
track how far it goes and eventually you learn about friction and static and dynamic friction etcetera all the 
stuff or chemistry where the teacher would sit in the front and titrate the red and blue and you 
or in biology you would dissect a frog and get a sciatic nerve preparation and electrical stimulation see the 
contract nc and there really been an analogous way of doing that kind of pedagogy in the social sciences 
partly for research purposes partly for pedagogic purposes we have developed a kind of software that allows us to 
an experiment in the morning we call it breadboard because modeled after those other things many of us remember 
high school where you would build electrical circuits on a breadboard with interchangeable components resistors and capacitors and batteries 
flip the switch the light bulb goes off amazing so our vision was that there would be interchangeable social 
you might manipulate the topology of the network into which people were placed or you might manipulate the directionality 
the ties or the payoff matrix or the information quality how much noise was there in the communication or 
wealth endowments of the individual nc so all of these social properties could be manipulated and you could create 
artificial societies and then experimentally change them and see what happens consistent with theoretical predictions so done a lot 
that work and that is in the book but i kinda put the cart before the horse let me 
you before the real experiments some of the natural experiments which is i think what asking about sc i 
i loved your real experiments but the natural experiments are even cooler laughter nc yeah the natural ones are 
well this is the thing this goes we could have a bigger conversation about causal inference i like to 
physics models because people say well this work is a criticism of some work in the social sciences is 
sort of atheoretical or merely observational well galileo discovering the moons around jupiter was merely observational or say is 
not experimental we be well astrophysics limited experimentation in astrophysics beautiful complicated work that relies on observation and theory 
computation so those critiques in and of themselves i think conceptually have much bearing but i will admit that 
lot of the work done is not a very high level or quality but nc the proper critique of 
works i think is that they simply are observational rather than experimental anyway so for so in an ideal 
at least from my mad scientist point of view what we would love to do is take a group 
babies that were acultural that is to say had no cultural upbringing or exposure and abandon them on an 
and let them grow up and then come back thirty or forty years later and see what kind of 
did they make sc now talking now this is the scientific brain at work yeah nc yes exactly exactly 
this would be exactly the kind of experiment i would do if i could do it is that is 
type of experiment now of course this is obviously cruel and unethical but it stopped people from thinking about 
for thousands of years been called the forbidden experiment sc so an official title for this this is something 
people fantasize about nc yes sc at drinks at sociology conferences nc well no not drinks or like sociologists 
so herodotus talks about an egyptian pharaoh who was very interested in what was the first language that people 
what language was in our brains actually an interesting question that a smart powerful person might have thought of 
of years ago and so what he did was he took two babies and gave them to a mute 
to be raised up in the mountains to see what language did they make if they were never exposed 
any language obviously an awful cruel experiment and many sc but we get some data nc yeah exactly but 
european monarchs also in the beginning of the and later also thought about this experiment they framed it in 
religious terms what language did adam and eve speak so they wanted to take babies and do the same 
and so been contemplated and sometimes allegedly done but obviously forbidden so instead what i look for some natural 
and one class of natural experiments was unintentional communities that were formed in the wake of shipwrecks so a 
of people who were choose to be were just sort of grabbed and dropped on an island and who 
who were at least nineteen people i picked as a threshold and who spent at least two months there 
then what could we learn from what kind of social order they made did they cooperate did they have 
did they befriend each other and did they teach each other things for example were there divisions and what 
the implications of the presence or absence of those features for the ability of the group to survive for 
which is a nice objective function to the group if you can get sc and eventually some of them 
to be rescued so that we could hear the results of these experiments nc correct and in fact there 
some famous very famous cases for example my most favorite so yeah so one further necessary criterion for this 
that yes there can be a supernova but the light might never hit the earth and so we would 
see it so we would so we need one at least one person to survive to tell the tale 
never heard we would never notice that this thing had happened but one famous example where that happen is 
was a shipwreck where a large group of i remember the details at the moment except i remember the 
detail which is they managed to capture some kind of huge bird i think a petrel they were in 
south pacific and they attached to this leg a message in a bottle like a little capsule with a 
identifying where they were their coordinates who they were that they were the shipwreck crew of such and such 
vessel and they attached it to this bird which the bird then flew thousands of miles and was found 
australia a few couple of years later and the message was found in red and an expedition was sent 
actually find these men and by the time the expedition got there the men were all gone they were 
it was felt that they had somehow sailed to another island because there was no evidence of their bodies 
so obviously we know what happened with that crew but an amazing attempt to communicate no so we need 
to survive and what i did was is there are about shipwrecks between not ships lost at sea ships 
wrecked on a coast between one thousand five hundred and and i found twenty of them that meet these 
at least nineteen people living for at least two months often for a year or more and often larger 
fifty or more people and i got all of the old records through journals that they kept and also 
modern archaeological excavations and try to get a sense of what do these people do how do they organize 
societies but that the only kind of evidence i looked at the settlement of polynesia the polynesian expansion when 
ancient polynesians spread out over the pacific and populated all these islands i looked not only at unintentional experiments 
also at intentional experiments at the communes in the century where people set off to make a utopian community 
even since roman times people have been doing this nc been saying society sucks go make our own and 
they go and in the and there were communal movements in the united states kibbutzes in israel or where 
looked at settlements of scientists in antarctica and the south pole since the the american station in the south 
has had groups of scientists and technicians that winter over so again isolated populations have to organize themselves in 
way what do they do and sc these are all made by people who of course come from our 
societies nc yes sc so not the forbidden experiment quite but at least gonna ask how they might diverge 
correct and they choose to be there volitional in culture adults there are lots of problems that make it 
ideal as an experiment but here again i use some of the examples you know i borrow some again 
physics metaphors that the fact that you know the telescope that galileo used was really crude and yet he 
able to see a lot with his telescope sc yeah nc you know the absence of a hubble mean 
we should look down on a more primitive way of understanding or a preliminary way of understanding the world 
yes light interference an atmospheric interference and noise and our equipment is imperfect but we can still see something 
we look at these unintentional and intentional communities and the last thing which i mentioned earlier was i collected 
about artificial communities either online worlds like world of warcraft or other massively multiplayer online engaged with our own 
or with the experiments of other scientists that have done these artificial experiments where they create groups and manipulate 
including incidentally some of our groups where we replaced some people with forms of ai bots so we create 
systems of humans and machines and replace some people with programmable agents and then we can really test happening 
have complete control over that agent so anyway so you look at all of this evidence and should i 
up or sc yeah yeah no yeah i think we nc i have been talking too much sc we 
easily spend two hours just telling stories of these ship wrecks so just encourage everyone to buy the book 
yes sc some great stories about shipwrecks in there i mean maybe mention just the one island that had 
ship wrecks on it at the same time nc yeah come come back to that yeah amazing but but 
to sum sc just sum up nc so then the challenge becomes so you have all of this data 
different sources but one way to think about this is to imagine a kind of a hyper space imagine 
space where you you have axes that are defined by for example how large is a facetoface community that 
to say how much can how many unique individuals can each person befriend and that number could go from 
to say you can imagine a creature like ours that could have a one thousand real friends most of 
have three or four or five real close intimate personal relationships and then you can imagine a society in 
you array how cooperative they are that is to say on a oneoff game how likely are they to 
to cooperate with a stranger and that probability could go from zero to one and then you can imagine 
society in which another axis which defines how unequally is the wealth distributed in that society from again zero 
one all the wealth belongs to one person or all the wealth is equally shared say nc so those 
to be three or of course you could have more axes and when you do that kind of an 
and what you find is that all human societies that have ever arisen occupied a small fraction of that 
space all clustered in a little tiny region and if you look at all the evidence from the unintentional 
intentional and artificial societies they all again and again manifest the same qualities so a kind of a kind 
way in which we only manifest a it seems like a lot of variation but actually not in the 
region of this space and so then the question become oh how and why did that come to be 
and why did natural selection constrain us to be just here sc is it easy to summarize what that 
is nc well it depends it depends on which axes you pick how many axes you allow i use 
examples from other animals i used i borrow actually some of richard dawkins ideas from even older work in 
on shell shape morphology so if trying to get a set of mathematical equations that define all possible shells 
could ever arise it turns out we can summarize these shells with either three or eleven you couldn talk 
that too decay sc these are the kinds of shells that snails crawl around in right nc yes exactly 
you find that only certain shells that could ever potentially have arisen have arisen and why is that is 
because for example it was impossible for natural selection even to give rise to such shells or is it 
there is no shell outside this cluster that is fit in any modern or any environment that has ever 
and so the argument by analogy is that something similar happens with human societies that there are no other 
of societies that would make sense to make and further evidence of that is in the book in that 
look at animal societies like elephants and whales and i find that the social suite that we find in 
also is in elephants for instance and in the elephants you know that our last common ancestor with elephants 
eightyfive million years ago we have by independent evolution converged on the same solution just like two species might 
converge on an eye we have because only certain ways you can make a camera type eye then to 
the light only certain ways you can live socially if a mammal and we find that again and again 
do you wanna go back and talk about that one ship example or i know sc no no no 
i think i just if possible i get that this large parameter space of how the societies could have 
and clearly the evidence is that we randomly fill up that parameter space we stick to certain commonalities and 
the elephants stick to these commonalities so clearly something beneficial and selected about some aspects of the social suite 
love and friendship and social cooperation and so forth so the actual communities that you talk about though seem 
at least on the face of it turn out very differently from time to time so is there a 
way of understanding what the commonalities are or it just that more than one way to be a society 
still far fewer than all the ones we could imagine nc well i mean not sure i fully understand 
question but i think i did so let me give two potentially just responsive answers sc please nc so 
question you one way to restate your question is well sometimes mutants like your body is programmed to do 
things to have a certain height or make insulin in a certain way and maybe you have a mutation 
makes you not capable of making insulin so you get diabetes and not as fit say for the environment 
which we live but that mutation is no more an illustration of the ordinary structure and function of the 
body that is to say something that pushes you away from say the ordinary structure and this is a 
in your genes biological and of course there can be environmental things so for example if you have a 
of children and you starve them they grow up to have they might be actually more prone to diabetes 
adulthood and they might also have stunted growth and in both of these cases either the intrinsic say mutation 
the environmental constraint we would not think we would say those have caused a swerving away from what was 
predestined to occur that otherwise would have been say nc now of course i realize that sometimes these mutations 
are beneficial in fact how evolution works but for now just computating this notion that something that could normally 
occur but in intrinsic or an endogenous or an exogenous reason been pushed away from it well the same 
i would make about societies a kind of inborn society but sometimes unable to realize that for example if 
times of scarcity if not enough food in the environment we might fall upon each other and eat each 
now we do that in fact some evidence in the book suggests that if we cooperate more likely to 
but i would argue that the society that humans make in a moment of scarcity that is to say 
there is no food at all is no more illustrative of the society humans would actually make if they 
adequate resources than the body you make if you have been raised in scarcity is illustrative of the body 
would make if there scarcity so trying to get at the kind of natural sort of innate thing you 
have done without constraint sc so when we talk about the island example i think this is a good 
case for these ideas where you had two different shipwrecks more or less overlapping in time but they know 
each other chuckle nc yeah that was incredible i got so lucky with that case i think the only 
case that aware of where in about one thousand eight hundred fortysix there in the south auckland islands south 
new zealand slightly north of the antarctica there were two shipwrecks at the same time in the same place 
this island and they spent over a year there one crew was almost two years one crew was just 
a year and they overlap for about a year and they did not know about each presence there was 
hint in one of the diaries that they saw some smoke in the distance one day and they went 
the smoke and they almost met i mean they almost met i think sc did you ever watch lost 
i did i saw a few episodes of lost yes sc you know it what it is chuckle nc 
there was there was sean carroll in a bunker underneath you know what sc the others laughter nc yes 
others laughter engineering this thing an incredible story and they were different they were very interesting and different so 
one wreck the grafton actually the grafton i had to relax my standards a little bit there were only 
members of the crew whereas in the invercauld which wrecked on the northern part the island the grafton wrecked 
the southern part the invercauld had nineteen people so the grafton the ship hits the shore in their foundering 
the captain had already been sick he had a fever and he was in his cabin and the ship 
sinking and other men make it to shore and they have to decide what to do about the captain 
they set up a rope pulley system and at great risk to themselves they ferry the captain ashore so 
wreck starts with the saving of a life where the people band together to save life and there are 
some sacrifice right some altruism yeah nc with some risk yes some risk and some sacrifice and there are 
shipwrecks not this one where similar things happened where for example another case that i discuss where the captain 
a big bag of gold in his cabin and the crew were trying to rescue the gold and he 
them not to rescue the gold to rescue a girl who was drowning instead and the gold was lost 
the captain acted this way and i think that type of activity sets the tone right for the group 
understand all in this together gonna cooperate gonna sink or what happens on the grafton and in the invercauld 
ship atomizes much more rapidly also a slight difference in salvage and the other details of the two crews 
the invercauld hits the shore and reduced to splinters within an hour and nineteen men make it ashore and 
have a pencil many of them they have no shoes some of them arrived naked this is a very 
scenario that the way that the crew would arrive naked literally on the shore they arrive with a pencil 
matches which eventually dry and able to light a fire a few days later although they screw up and 
to dry their matches by the camp fire and then they ignite all of them sc oh no nc 
so no total disaster but they get their first fire going and a couple of pounds of hardtack and 
couple of pounds of salted pork their salvage plus some clothes and one of the people was injured and 
the base of these cliffs and they abandon this man the other eighteen climb up and sent an advance 
up to find some pigs that had been previously set loose on this island by other people decades earlier 
pigs so they could see some food up there and so eighteen of them go and they abandon this 
to die and the beginning of the invercauld and ultimately all five of the grafton people survive and make 
off they sail away on their own and only three of the nineteen on the invercauld survive and they 
cannibalism and routinely abandoning their weakest members a totally different destiny sc so but what does that teach us 
the discussion between the sort of determinism of the social sleek pushing societies in a certain direction versus the 
of some influential event early on leading to later repercussions nc right well again i will just invoke the 
of the body that your body has a set up the dna programs your body could be a certain 
for example it might program you to be very hairy but you might shave your hair so there is 
environmental thing that happens that makes you shave your hair so really mad at myself and the laughter nc 
best analogy i could come up with on short notice or some cultures for example that bind heads like 
american cultures to reshape their heads so that the elites of this society were supposed to have a head 
looked like a boat called scaphocephaly sometimes babies are born in this way because the sutures of their cranium 
are prematurely fused and they get a oblong head they thought it was very beautiful so they would bind 
to give them this really kind of alienlooking head shape now that alien head shape is no more illustrative 
the natural head shape than anything else so i would say analogously to what were discussing even though there 
an innate type of society we are predestined or prewired to make which resembles other social mammals too incidentally 
are contingencies that can swerve us away from it and those can include poor leadership it can include profound 
constraints although often we see paradoxically one of the arguments i make in the book is that we are 
able to meet our needs for food and water and shelter nc it used to be thought that you 
to meet those primary needs first before you could manifest these more sublime qualities like love and friendship and 
but i actually think that in many ways we have that in the reverse that actually meeting our needs 
friendship and cooperation first is what actually allows us to meet our other more basic needs for food and 
and so forth and i think good evidence for that so anyway so there can be contingencies that swerve 
away from it but i think those undermine the claim that there is a kind of basic core society 
were prewired to make sc okay that makes sense and actually you intrigued me now so what is this 
that love and friendship need to come before food and water chuckle nc well so again just a laugh 
the book laughter sc buy the book but we all know texting sir nc yeah exactly exactly so let 
not gonna run out of megabytes here worry tell us the story nc yeah yeah okay well just mindful 
to ask you all these questions about your own work but i took advantage of this opportunity and i 
like i know probably the point being interviewed about the book sc right nc sc get there nc oh 
so i guess the basic point that i would make is the following point in a kind of broad 
level answer to your question which is our species i think has one of the broadest ranges on the 
of any species maybe even broader than ants a particular species and we have what eo wilson calls the 
conquest of the earth why why are we able to live everywhere from the equator to the arctic from 
to rivers some people are seafaring people that literally never live on land they spend their whole i discuss 
in the book the so call sea nomads for example they always live at sea and they forage for 
food at sea nc they literally hunt under water and they are the best free divers in the world 
evolved in some ways in response to this this capacity but anyway so why are we able to do 
the reason able to do that is because of our capacity for culture precisely because we evolve the capacity 
accumulate knowledge across time and space and to distribute it across time and space so that for example a 
born in the united states today in high school learns enough and can learn mathematics that would have made 
or her the most sophisticated mathematician on the planet five hundred years ago actually as an aside one thing 
amazes me is that isaac newton invented the calculus at the speed in which we teach it which is 
mind boggling to me you know sc all amazed by that yeah laughter nc just unbelievable right the guy 
calculus in a year sc yeah nc just incredible anyway so you are we are all the beneficiaries of 
of this knowledge that has been accumulated the roads and the smelting of metals and the agriculture all the 
animals that our ancestors domesticated and the knowledge of the stars and of navigation techniques and mathematics and actually 
spreads across the planet so very rare that someone makes a private discovery and no one ever else hears 
it you know its disseminated and like to disseminate knowledge and to learn from others where evolved to do 
so this capacity that we have evolved for culture is in fact what makes it possible for us to 
everywhere in the world nc so i guess what what gone on this long digression to explain that we 
cultural animals and that this equips us to live in many different environments is that that very variety that 
privilege and that we see is actually a quality that we evolve to have that capacity to manifest culture 
to be animals that teach and learn and the more primary and fundamental ability that we have sc yeah 
a wonderful example you have in the book of the fact that human faces exhibit a lot more variety 
faces of a lot of other animals and part of that is how we identify each other right nc 
well another kind of paradox some paradoxes when you think about human social living the capacity to be individuals 
itself lies at the core of our capacity to live socially so we have evolved the ability to signal 
individuality we do it with our faces every human face is different and the regions of our genome that 
responsible for the shape and appearance of our faces are highly variable from person to person whereas the region 
your genome that makes insulin is roughly the same i mean there are differences but roughly the same whereas 
region of our genome that makes our faces is very different and gives rise to differently shaped faces in 
kinds of ways furthermore each feature of our face is uncorrelated with every other feature nc for example if 
look at your hands people with longer hands also have wider hands and like one parameter that is the 
size whereas if you look at for instance the width of nose people with wider noses are not necessarily 
with taller noses those two properties are uncorrelated in our face precisely because we many combinations possible of all 
features of our face to give the most variety in our faces and not only do we have this 
which is actually uncommon in animals and is an evolutionary luxury we also have the cognitive capacity to tell 
difference nc so you can look out at a sea of faces and see that face is different and 
also is an evolutionary luxury so both of these qualities the ability to signal your identity and the ability 
detect the identity of others are unusual among animals and are expensive or evolutionarily expensive all this brain power 
needs to be engineered to be able to do this thing but essential for living socially and the reason 
for living socially is you have to first be able to identify specific other individuals if to be able 
tell a friend and an enemy or who is my child that i should actually give food to as 
to a child that i necessarily raise or who cooperated with me in the past and i need to 
their kindness so evolved this capacity for individual identity that is essential for our ability to live socially and 
use our faces for that sc for me that was a little insight a big insight i got from 
book is one of these things you take for granted of course i know different individuals and i have 
relationships with different individuals but may be elsewhere in the animal or the plant kingdoms for that matter those 
are not quite as obvious the idea of friendship and having a social network you talk about it a 
in the book is it really that different between human beings and other animal species friendship nc well very 
so first of all many animals evolved to reproduce sexually so not uncommon that we and many animals also 
to reproduce sexually with the same mate across time to have a kind of monogamy but we not just 
with each other we befriend each other we form longterm nonreproductive unions to other members of our species and 
rare we have friends and rare in the animal kingdom to have these sustained relations with nonkin unrelated individuals 
do it elephants do it certain cetaceans do it orcas dolphins certain other primates do it very rare some 
they say dogs wild dogs do it but not they might but not exactly right because packs of dogs 
are genetically related cousins and so forth sc i was thinking when reading that part of the book i 
thought about pets right i mean dogs and cats in some sense bond with their owners do they bond 
their owners more than with other dogs and cats nc well another whole topic the domesticated animals and our 
with those animals which i actually give some examples in the book of that and i think in some 
happening there is our innate desire for friendship and sociability is being applied to and met by our relationships 
these animals now often we domesticate animals that are quite social on their own sc right nc so horses 
in herds and dogs live in packs and those animals already innately even birds flying flocks those animals innately 
have a sense of interacting with others but not always some people keep pet lizards for instance and we 
this as i said and certain other social mammals do it not the same in the eusocial insects so 
and termites and you know what all clones right genetically the same so not so special that one ant 
help another ant its identical twin sc yeah nc much more difficult to provide an account for why we 
that and we do and the evolution of friendship is profound actually and very interesting and it occurs as 
said not just in us but in certain other animals sc and maybe from my extremely anthropocentric point of 
i think surprised that friendship more common in the animal kingdom we take it so much for granted that 
have different kinds of relationships with other different humans it shocks me that not more similar in other at 
in mammalian species say nc right well it would have in order for it to evolve it would have 
meet a need right it would have to serve some purpose and in part you would have to have 
availability of strangers you would have to live in groups to start with the first order criterion is that 
has to be a group of animals a solitary animal would be unlikely say to evolve the capacity to 
another solitary animal he occasionally ran into for instance so have to have first group living animals and then 
further evolution of this capacity to form longterm nonreproductive unions to unrelated individuals again not hard to explain it 
challenging but scientists have done this why might you help your cousins well kin selection and arguments from evolution 
the evolution of altruism towards your even liferisking altruism towards your relatives make sense but why would you willingly 
to your friends and a set of arguments about why that might be the case one argument has to 
with the fact that the evolution of the ability to help people in need when it cost you very 
is very valuable nc so if you think about what friends do for each other we often do each 
favors of different kinds or we help each other we provide emotional support and we do that in a 
that is not strictly reciprocated not like scratch your back now scratch my back tomorrow done in the sort 
unconditional way and an enormously valuable type of relationship to have in a social system where someone is drowning 
it cost you much to lower a branch to them so that they can be saved this altruism to 
unrelated individual could be extremely useful if such a thing were to evolve and so a set of ideas 
john tooby and leda cosmides have argued correctly in my view about the evolution of friendship and hruska as 
donald hruska also makes these arguments sc is there some relationship to language it would seem to me that 
individuals became better more adept at speaking and communicating and agreeing and negotiating in more subtle ways then it 
become more useful to have a higher level of differentiation in our relationships between different people nc i think 
a deep relationship between the evolution of language and the evolution of friendship and actually even group dynamics some 
have argued i mean robin dunbar has argued that our capacity for language evolved in part to be a 
of efficient oral grooming so chimpanzees will groom each other so one will groom the other maybe take turns 
whatever maybe form a little circle but all dyadic you can only groom one other animal at a time 
a group of humans can sit in a circle and talk to each other and i can give five 
something of value not just one person using language so a kind this transmission of information a kind of 
a kind of way in which you could talk to multiple people at once sc okay cool and to 
i do wanna let the audience know you have all sorts of little diagrams of networks in your book 
social networks because we i did a podcast with steven strogatz who studies networks from a purely mathematical point 
view and so been able to uncover sort of things about the structure of friendship by these network diagrams 
yeah steve is a giant in the field we use various sort of mathematical tools and analytic tools to 
out these networks and trace out the topology of these graphs and summarize them and analyze them in the 
sorts of ways and there are a number of interesting properties that arise when you look at that one 
of ideas has to do with the fact that when well several ideas let me write them down worried 
forget them sc yeah okay good nc properties of networks worldwide sc you wrote a very long book nc 
know and then i one of things that happens is is that i get over excited and then i 
up a tree and then i go out on a branch and i go out on a twig and 
i fall off and i know where the tree is any more sc i know how it is nc 
sc do you have a deadline for how long we can talk by the way i have more questions 
no openended no openended sc okay good go nc worried that being too loquacious and sc not possible nc 
okay so on the so when you begin to use these tools to map networks you can make a 
of discoveries first of all you can ask yourself the following question which i think is still not completely 
all though i am spending a lot of time in my laboratory trying to answer it which is you 
imagine say you have one hundred people and you have the boundary conditions are a null set where no 
is connected to anyone else or a fully saturated graph where you have n times divided by two connections 
of course everywhere in between you can have all these other possible networks okay nc well when you go 
these these networks can have very interesting properties mathematical properties and you can go out into the world and 
map networks and you find again and again that human beings make a particular kind of network and then 
can say why do they make this kind of network as compared to any other for example human beings 
something known as degree assortitivity that is to say that highlyconnected nodes are preferentially attached to other highly connected 
this is the opposite of an airport network in an airport network you have degree disassortativity so you have 
like denver and chicago and new york that are connected to lots of small airports but the small airports 
not connected to each other you fly from lebanon new hampshire to new haven connecticut you have to go 
lebanon new hampshire to boston and then from boston to new haven or to philadelphia or whatever nc so 
assortative networks are networks in which highly connected individuals are connected to highly so very popular people befriend popular 
and unpopular people befriend unpopular people so you might ask do we do well very interesting it turns out 
degree assortative networks confer on a population a relative immunity to epidemic diseases so in a degree disassortative network 
an epidemic if a bioterrorist strikes one city in the next hop people will go from that city to 
and the next day everyone else in the whole country will be affected because people fly out from denver 
a degree assortative network if the epidemic begins at random somewhere in the graph only if it happens to 
one of these few nodes that is high degree will it spread to everyone otherwise the epidemic will tend 
be localized within a particular region of the network for instance among unpopular people just giving the germ to 
few other unpopular people so it takes much longer for the epidemic to spread nc so i think a 
that of all the ways we could come to organize our networks we have organized them to have this 
of degree assortativity i think natural selection has played a role and this touches on very contentious issues having 
do with multilevel selection and other topics but the gist is of all the possible networks we could arrange 
have networks that have this property and many other interesting properties like for instance we have highly transitive networks 
is to say your friends are very likely to be friends with each other much more likely than a 
graph with a similar number of ties and a similar number of nodes and this transitivity also confers certain 
for group coherence and cooperation and so forth nc so the first thing like to say about these graphs 
when you do these graphs and you mathematically summarize these networks you make a number of observations about the 
of graphs people make from all imaginable graphs and then i think a just so story you observe that 
of those properties that you can characterize have benefits and i think they have those benefits precisely because natural 
has worked on us to give us those benefits first point sc yeah oh that was your first point 
let me make two little quick sub points i know this is gonna be an expanding kind nc written 
the other points so not gonna forget sc okay good so here are my two little subpoints one is 
think it makes sense to me that the graphs like this are chosen by natural selection but on the 
hand not obvious because maybe a physical making the graphs mechanism that naturally just easily leads to graphs like 
and just lucky that also very useful i would love to get evidence that points one way or the 
sc the second point is that the robustness of this kind of network structure i think is a wonderful 
for human beings who intelligently design networks in computers or on the internet or in their electrical grids that 
as robust as the ones that nature builds and often because you know we try to imagine what the 
are ahead of time and not very good at that whereas natural selection just sort of has put up 
a whole bunch of unpredictable threats and generates therefore a very generally robust way of dealing with them nc 
i would agree with both of those points actually and so yes do you want me to comment on 
or just to say i agree sc no if you say great then we go to number two nc 
i would agree with those points so that was the first point that i was making was about why 
have this particular topology of all the possible topologies the second point is that when you go out therefore 
the world and you map these networks as we have and sent teams to uganda india honduras the united 
and various other places around the world sudan when you map these networks you find that these networks again 
again have a very similar architecture a very similar topology and i find that amazing actually that you can 
all over the planet and people befriend each other and each person is exercising their predestiny to befriend each 
and then we assemble ourselves into this structure like ant colonies like ant hills where we reproduceably make again 
again this type of characteristic structure so the second thing i would say is that first point is that 
make a particular kind of network second is we always do it sc yes nc some tolerance but again 
again we reproduce these types of networks and the third thing i would say is that amazingly other social 
make networks with very similar topological properties so earlier we talk about transitivity the transitivity of elephant networks is 
dolphin networks is very similar to our own why should it be that the friend of a friend among 
is the friend and a friend of a friend among elephants is the friend and a friend of a 
among humans is a friend well because it serves a purpose you know laughter sc yeah nc and clearly 
independently because again our last common ancestor was tens of millions of years ago and was a nonsocial creature 
i think these are all things of the all three of these points relate to the issue of the 
of networks and their function in our lives sc yeah no i think that a fascinating feature because it 
one of these things where everyone investigating this is a human being and therefore grows up as a human 
and tends to take certain things for granted and amazing when we learn that things been different or have 
be this way speaking of which not only friendship but love which you talk about in the book and 
seems different also is also something that is at least more often human than in other animals by love 
mean sort of romantic attachment to your life long sexual partner right and i love never heard of the 
that there are some societies that try to do away with it that try to make reproduction purely about 
make sex purely about reproduction and not let you fall in love and yet as in romeo and juliet 
always try to get around that nc yes yeah i mean love again another thing so interesting to me 
unicultural universal we love our partners even in arranged marriages so about a billion people live in countries that 
primarily arranged marriages many many tens or hundreds of millions of people meet only met their spouse once or 
before they marry them and go home with them and start having sex with them and raise a family 
them and make a life with each other and amazingly when you use various metrics like the passionate love 
or you look at divorce rates divorce rates are lower in arranged marriages for a number of reasons including 
constraints sc yeah nc but the sentiment of love so even in those societies that have arranged marriages while 
before marriage is seen as a threat and not say the best way to organize how people should choose 
other love after marriage is very much seen as a desired property everyone thinks you should fall in love 
the person chosen for you to marry so this is a cultural universal too this fact that we love 
mates but you have to ask yourself why we could be a species that reproduces without loving our mates 
sc most do right nc yeah mostly just not in all species so this is what discussing here is 
kind of attachment that survives a single sexual encounter a kind of sustained attachment which in our species we 
as love sc yeah nc a kind of sentimental feeling and a emotional bond and a social bond to 
people with whom we have sex now not every person has it all the time of course you could 
sex about being in love you could be in love without having sex it have to be straight of 
gay couples love each other and so not linked to reproduction in our species which itself is interesting all 
these things are true but the core is that we love we have this capacity to love the people 
we are having sex with or feel attached to them and this is this type of social monogamy this 
of sensibility is seen in certain of birds are socially monogamous they mate for life as it were they 
attached to their partners and certain other mammals and seen universally in humans and i think very interesting nc 
as you said some exceptions so one people the na people in the himalayas who organize their society they 
a strong cultural overlay like we were discussing earlier the way certain historical contingencies can swerve you away from 
innate they have a very powerful overlanguage its organized to prevent couples from feeling affection for each other and 
example not uncommon for women with a matrilineal society the men will go trawling for sex in the evenings 
women will stay at home the young men and older men will knock at fences and say sex with 
tonight have sex with me the woman will make her choice say have sex with and they might have 
kind of a fleeting relationship for a number of days or weeks or a year but she could have 
than one at a time if she wanted nc and the boys that are rejected they are not supposed 
feel rejected or jealous their friends will mock them say another girl in the other village or down the 
are you feeling this way you feel attached stop it feel attached just go have sex with someone laughter 
and mockery of people who have sexual jealousy and not uncommon for women in these villages to have had 
with every other man in that village or every other village of their cohort for instance now in but 
in this society some couples for them the forbidden fruit is to be in love and they will fall 
love and say running away to be in love to just be together just the two of sc crazy 
that they are nc yes crazy rebels that they are exactly its like i just wanna have sex with 
i wanna be i love with you i wanna spend my life with you and they help it and 
is to my knowledge the only society organized this way and marco polo encountered it and writes about it 
chinese communist party thought that this licentious behavior was sapping productivity and needed to be stamped out these bourgouise 
sc yeah they would think that yeah nc yes and they tried to stamp it out but they anyway 
still practice they still have this type of traditional order among the na sc so is given the socialsuite 
you talked about your eight factors one of them is love is there a particular explanation i know always 
danger of these justso stories but can you come up with a theory at least as to why love 
along with these other properties that seem not maybe uniquely but especially human nc well we know exactly why 
evolved the capacity for love the leading candidate is that attachment the attachment females feel to their male partners 
males feel to their female partners because most of the evolutionary force was acting on heterosexual unions that capacity 
have served a purpose and one set of ideas has to do with enhancing the prospects of survival of 
offspring sc yeah nc that children have better likelihood of surviving especially in a highly cultural animal like ours 
needs to be taught when the parents stick around when both parents stick around now not the you know 
do the same thing by the way so not the only animal that has biparental care but attachment seems 
be essential for that to happen the male needs to feel like that any contributions making to the rearing 
these children are his and one way to do that is by the female of the species telegraphing attached 
you in other words if you see that i love you you know these are your children your offspring 
but as soon as you say penguins do it too that sort of gives the game away because thousands 
species out there and not like they mostly do it like we have to kind of go pretty far 
the evolutionary tree to find others that do it the same way nc yeah well of birds mate for 
so very common in the birds sc okay better nc yeah but very uncommon in mammals incidentally and also 
should i be very careful to emphasize that important here is the attachment not the number of partners sc 
nc so for instance so polygamous and polyandrous societies also have love sc right nc so not about having 
partner about the extra feeling you have about the partner having sex with sc yeah not purely reproductive nc 
sc some emotional attachment as well yeah well okay so these are the good aspects talked about friendship and 
and love now among your eight factors in the social suite one that is ingroup bias and another one 
is mild hierarchy so you say mild hierarchy so you want your little hierarchy but you want your cake 
eat it too not too much hierarchy right how do you fit these two factors in which might seem 
little bit less obviously peace and love and understanding in with the other ones nc well even these qualities 
superficially might seem to be disadvantageous like this ingroup bias for example this preference we have for us over 
which is a which is innate part of our nature a universal actually very depressing to me that we 
this way its part of our nature even this quality has evolved in order to support our capacity for 
sc it is one of the most robust psychological findings right i think that you mentioned in the book 
also a study that came out very recently where you give children completely arbitrary markers of in this group 
in that group and instantly they favor the people in their group not the other one nc i know 
depressing it you can randomly assign children to tshirts threeyearolds to a blue and a green tshirt you can 
that they know that chance they recognize that they do something to deserve this color and nevertheless with this 
called minimal group this is called the minimal group paradigm you can elicit from them oh those green shirted 
awful they should be punished they get any toys awful an sc screw those guys yeah exactly nc yeah 
its an just an awful part of our nature honestly sc but kind of i think your argument is 
awfulness is kind of a spandrel is kind of a side effect of a goodness a usefulness to this 
bias nc yes exactly right and that it has evolved to support our capacity for cooperation not the only 
that has evolved to support our capacity for cooperation but important one so in a way this ingroup bias 
a tool to reduce the scale so imagine you have a large population here and then in the middle 
you have groups and at the bottom level you have individuals so top level you have a huge population 
level you have groups us and them in the bottom level you have individuals the capacity to draw the 
between us and them is gonna be essential to reduce the scale of the people you need to cooperate 
if i put you in a large group and say with very hard for cooperation to evolve and for 
to practice it but if i say cooperate with your group and you have to cooperate with everyone actually 
makes it easier for cooperation to evolve in that type of a situation nc so one of the theories 
the evolution of xenophobia or parochialism or ingroup bias is that it makes it possible for us to cooperate 
each other but i should say that not the only thing the evolution of friendship also meets that need 
you think about friendship what friendship does is it adds structure to a population so instead of a well 
population instead of having everyone is randomly interacting with everyone else a network imposes structure so each person is 
only with certain other people but everyone has their own alters everyone has someone interacting with and now i 
tell you cooperate with your friends everyone was cooperating with just their friends and so it reduces the scale 
adding structure to the population nc and so another way to get cooperation but ingroup bias is one of 
and it it is a i mean it is one of the most depressing things that i have to 
about because you know why we just have indifference to the outgroup must we hate it why we just 
our own group okay fine let you love your own group but you have to kill the other group 
should you just let them be or sc well recording this podcast in the midst of the nba playoffs 
as a sixers fan i can tell you that celtic fans are just not as morally good as sixers 
just empirical finding but is chuckle nc yes but do you think they deserve to die i mean would 
launch a war against them sc no you know i kill them but if they were in distress i 
not go all out of my way to help all nc i can see that sc but this is 
something where maybe this is the time when it is worth mentioning that we can talk about innate tendencies 
things that make us human but we also have the cognitive capacities to overcome them we can think about 
to shift our ingroup biases and change the focus as to where we put our locus of care the 
circle nc right so i think the way i would say it the way i would argue about that 
yes one tool at our disposal is just to use our brains that we have been endowed with to 
this is a part of our nature but i have agency i have to do this correct but also 
tools that we could draw on so for example earlier when you imagined the threelevel model like the large 
the subgroups that are defined subset and then the individuals one thing we can do is you can go 
a level and you can use the capacity that been endowed with to draw the boundaries these are artificial 
in our groups we say us and them we said like the tshirts is an artificial boundary and instead 
you can do is you or language or religion these are artificial boundaries you can go up a level 
you can redefine the boundary to be the whole group nc and if you think about the american project 
example if you think politically about what ails our society today a kind of overidentification of groups and the 
of suspension of a commitment to the american project and one of the things amazing about our society is 
anyone can be an american we say if you come to this country it matter whether your ancestors were 
or irish or indian or whatever you can you are an american you just have to accept our political 
the bill of rights and our constitutional government and you can be an american other companies necessarily do this 
the way very difficult become swiss citizen for example or a japanese citizen but you can become an american 
and so this has always been a part of our society de tocqueville talks about this extraordinary thing and 
it is in essence is e pluribus unum you go up a level and you say really matters is 
i think that one of the reasons we have ascendant tribalism in our society today is in part a 
effect of the collapse of the soviet union i think when we when we were all united against the 
enemy i think there was a bit more solidarity in our society yes of course we had political differences 
not saying it was the best of all possible worlds but i think not a coincidence that this recrudescence 
tribalism in our society at this historical moment follows closely on the heels of the lack of another superpower 
kind of trying to countermand for response sc so what we should be hoping for is an invasion by 
yes yes i sc so that all of humanity could come together nc yes i think that would be 
for our common good the problem is those aliens quite actually love your opinion on this i think those 
would be just very likely to wipe us out i think be beneficent what do you think sc yeah 
the way that i would put it is we have no idea but if a chance that they would 
us out is that a risk worth taking put it this way we have a very good idea that 
could wipe us out nc if they got here yes sc yeah the chances if we meet any alien 
that we would be able to put up a fair fight are negligible so i would rather see the 
race try to figure stuff out for themselves for a few more years before we meet the aliens personally 
yeah inclined to agree with you leaving out the fantasy that in a of the situation they would be 
by our bacteria and be wiped out i think much more likely a species that could reach our planet 
treat us with the same indifference that we might stomp on an anthill if you cross an ocean to 
to another continent or frankly that we saw with the colonization of south america right the indigenous peoples were 
wiped out by the spaniards and with just indifference so i sc well to be fair there is a 
to that which we should put on the table which is that nc they would evolve to be beneficent 
we know again well maybe a threshold that species cross into selfawareness a certain level of cognitive capacity and 
where they can use language and have technology and so forth and once you reach that you have a 
empathy and fellow feeling for all the other species that feel likewise now maybe not right nc how are 
treating the elephants on our planet sc well hopefully getting better terrible is obviously the answer but maybe getting 
all of these things are happening on such a rapid time scale that if trying to ask questions about 
we will be doing one thousand years from now almost completely hopeless right so not saying we have figured 
out but saying that there is a logical possibility that we are in the process of figuring it out 
by the time the aliens get here they will have figured it out nc what i used to think 
i would be happy to follow your lead in thinking what saying but increasingly getting more on a tangent 
a tangent right now but i get more worried sort of buying stephen argument a bit more than i 
to about this topic sc and the one who just wrote a book about optimism laughter nc exactly okay 
hold on so we were talking about groupiness and collective identity but another technique that evolution has equipped us 
which often is overlooked and the capacity not to step up and take advantage of our ability to define 
but to step down a level to the level of individuals and so here the idea is we have 
the tribalism not by expanding the the boundary but by decreasing the boundary down to the individual level what 
say is that you should treat each other person as an individual earlier we talked about how we have 
capacity as an animal to uniquely identify every other person and this too has been a part of our 
and our society actually at the root of what martin luther king argues when he says he looks forward 
a society where we people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their 
saying each person should be judged as a person not as a member of a group and this also 
a tool that evolution has equipped us with and as it turns out in my view provides an avenue 
of the tribalism that is afflicting us today sc yeah good a whole maybe for the next podcast when 
have you on next year again discover some of these so many other things i wanna get to the 
question mild hierarchy is one of your elements of the social suite so this seems to suggest that on 
one hand human beings like to have a little bit of hierarchy but not too much is that a 
gloss nc yes and again you have to ask yourself why we evolved this i need to scribble some 
so i go off the deep end again so why do we have mild hierarchy again you can imagine 
parameter space of hierarchy from complete absence of hierarchy when everyone is absolutely equal with no differential resources or 
say to a complete autocracy where one person can completely dominate other individuals and kill them at will say 
we are in the middle regime it turns out as a primate species and we have involved this capacity 
mild hierarchy and mild hierarchy is important because both extremes are bad for us and bad for us in 
specific ways nc first of all in the absence of any hierarchy turns out that some experiments that have 
done by jessica flack at santa fe and others where taken primate species mapped their networks identified the top 
or the top primates and they have experimentally removed them from the network what they find is that chaos 
a tremendous amount of fighting as people jockey for power and position even among the subordinate peripheral individuals so 
of the things that a little hierarchy does is it tamps down on violence it keeps the peace it 
people from fighting with each other in addition some evidence that a little bit of hierarchy and here now 
when popular individuals when some people are popular regulates the flow of information through the graph and optimizes the 
of good things and suppresses the flow of bad things sc saying that walter cronkite was better than twitter 
spreading news around nc yes actually a really good example approximately but yes right that if some kind of 
filter in the information so for that this helps keep the peace so some evidence of this role of 
hierarchy but in addition we humans have evolved two different ways of communicating status two different kinds of ways 
can think about hierarchies or sort of status in a society and one of them has to do with 
hierarchies and many animals have this and this has to do with the ability typically physical ability of bigger 
to impose their will on others the sort of dominance hierarchy nc and you can think about these as 
the costs that one animal can impose on another animal so the animal with bigger antlers or bigger tusks 
example can kill or drive away the other animal and so subordinates in those types of hierarchies try to 
the superordinate state because of the cost the subordinates can impose on them but we humans have a parallel 
of hierarchy which is based on prestige and prestige hierarchies have to do with the benefits that superordinates can 
on subordinates and because the superordinates say have knowledge we are smart so your graduate students assuming want to 
time with you because of the benefits you can confer upon them assuming sc so they believe they know 
them but yeah nc rather than avoid you because of the cost that you can impose on them these 
prestige hierarchies and in our species these often have to do with cognitive abilities we can teach each other 
so we have two parallel ways of having hierarchy in our society roughly speaking the costs which often are 
and the benefits which often are combinant that we can distribute and evidence for both in our ancestral in 
evolution but because of this connection to prestige that mild hierarchy can be beneficial the existence of people with 
knowledge that can distribute these benefits to others is part of the reason you want some of the mild 
now when you get too much what typically what we feel has happened likely to have happened not sure 
that subordinates probably resented too much power going to some particular individuals and probably banded together and killed them 
and so one of the reasons we think in our evolution been shaped for a mild hierarchy is precisely 
this reason sc yeah so is it seems as if going to guess and correct me if wrong that 
thing about mild hierarchy is it is the best system for various reasons and therefore maybe it explains why 
evolve to like it obviously there are examples in history where gone to complete autocracy and stratification or complete 
and egalitarianism but some happy middle where gonna argue that we tend toward nc yes what i would argue 
that evidence from other social mammals that this is optimal including experiments with primates so right and it often 
to do with social animals that have the capacity for teaching and learning that can collect and distribute information 
you get these kind of counterbalancing forces so basically instead of having organizing the society around the dominance hierarchy 
all of a sudden you need to reduce the ability of physically very powerful individuals to dominate and see 
to put this exactly it turns out that one of the reasons it is felt that we have mild 
is that been a kind of rough justice a kind of rough calculus between dominance hierarchies and prestige hierarchies 
why we wind up a little bit in the middle range as i talk about in the book sc 
makes sense all of these features of the social suite from identity love friendship hierarchy and group bias you 
say not only there but you wanna say genetic that built into our dna somehow is that mostly sort 
circumstantial what else could it be if that universal or is there something is there more directly genetic evidence 
we can point to for the origins of these features that sounds like something that would be very difficult 
this point in human history to really establish nc well no for some traits quite a lot of evidence 
lab has done a lot of work on the genetics of friendship for example and been able to show 
the propensity for friendship some of the higher order structures we were discussing earlier are partially genetically encoded no 
a role for culture also and nurture but clearly a role of nature shown that the way you choose 
friends is partly shaped by your genes you might be able to reason by analogy and see for example 
people are capable of love at first sight not an uncommon phenomenon you should have the intuition that that 
at first sight probably has something to do with genes that is to say that some kind of optimal 
choice should be under selection is not a shocking claim and a lot of evidence for that in the 
for example we do experiments for that but i would say friendship choice also is under natural selection for 
reasons and we have evidence for this and so evidence for that also evidence for a partially genetic basis 
attachment for love nc there is surprisingly little evidence so far that been able to adduce for the genetics 
cooperation in our species but we do have some such evidence in other animals so again scream credulity to 
so we have information on the level of genes using a variety of approaches that provide evidence for this 
the comparative phylogenetic approach where for example we find similar properties seen in other animals or we can trace 
out across evolution so we can say when did social monogamy appear in our species and we see a 
specific historical evolutionary moment when that occurred and we can trace out the branches and this type of evidence 
is evidence so lots of convergent evidence that supports the claim that many of these qualities are shaped by 
selection and partially encoded in our genes sc but not at the point yet where we could actually point 
a place in the genome where this is a preference for mild hierarchy or something like that right nc 
and in part because these traits are so complex we cannot even do that with height or schizophrenia risk 
increasingly seeing that many of these complex traits are polygenic so the kind of thing we all learned in 
school biology about sickle cell disease or thalassemia being monogenic mutations that follow mendelian inheritance those are the exceptions 
most forget most of the behavioral and complex traits we manifest even a lot of the physical traits like 
schizophrenia risk or your diabetes risk or your height also are polygenic that we barely we know there are 
a couple of hundred genes that are responsible for height we know height is very heritable but only or 
the variance can be explained by known genes so something else is going on and being worked on very 
nc i think in our lifetimes likely to know the answers to some of these questions i think it 
to do with the combinatorial complexity of the genes that is to say not about which genes you have 
how they interact with each other and furthermore the temporal unfolding so you might have five genes each of 
has two variants the precise sequence at which they turn on and off might determine how tall you are 
if you have the same variance in a given individual and we know anything about that yet we know 
about it but learning more about that sc yeah i think just important to emphasize lot of people hear 
something is genetic and they think a gene for it and find the gene we both know and i 
probably most of our listeners know way more complicated than that and so that you can have good evidence 
something is heritable as you say without having any idea where it comes from in the dna nc yes 
the like for example give you an interesting thing talking about facial morphology one of those famous examples in 
biology of something known as an adaptive radiation which is from an original species how many other species evolved 
fill in various niches is finches right sc right nc so he looks at all these beaks and he 
that different animals have different beaks depending on what kind of food is available on the island with those 
from an ancestral population of finches the finches on this island evolved to eat nuts and the ones on 
island to eat flowers and they all have different things and just recently i think it was published in 
like a couple of years ago the genetics of this was worked out so we actually know what are 
genes that have variants that affect the shape of the beak in these animals you know something that same 
affects our faces chuckle and evidence that that same gene plays a role in facial morphology in humans and 
think i had the footnotes to that in the book so i think we will find for example increasingly 
genetic evidence for some of these qualities including for example the individual expression sc what do you think are 
of we are winding down here so what are some of the normative implications of what saying you have 
brief section in the book at the end where you talk about morality for example and i think this 
a place gonna disagree because you seem to be more sympathetic than i am to somehow extracting some moral 
out of the facts about who we are and how we got here nc right so moral philosophy is 
attempt to provide a kind of building up of moral principles from axioms like euclidean geometry we start with 
axioms i think it is i remember and you get all of euclidean geometry from some parallel lines continue 
and some blah blah but the moral philosophers have been working for at least fifty years maybe more and 
have yet to uncover what these universal you know what these fundamental axioms that are universally applicable are and 
that moral philosophy cannot not about voting right you like have everyone vote right we know things that we 
consider to be grossly immoral like the killing of autistic kids in nazi germany where everyone thought that was 
and but you and i would look at that and think just clearly immoral so not about the majority 
or might make right not about a majority rule otherwise the cardinals would have been correct and galileo would 
been wrong so not what determines whether something is right is how many people believe it nc not determined 
whether powerful people espouse it so a sense in moral philosophy that there must be some kind of outside 
human ways that we could come up with developing these moral principles now i am skeptical actually that that 
will succeed for a number of reasons and here i share perspective the philosopher but i do believe that 
can help guide the way as i argue a little bit in the book and here i borrow some 
from philosopher philippa foot where she very famously says moral she said think helpful to think about sc laughter 
makes you think yes nc yes i love philosophers just incredible you know like the hell does she mean 
that she goes on to explain that when you think about plants you can think about whether a plant 
good roots and she says that you can speak of this plant has good roots or bad roots and 
are good roots good roots are the roots that make it possible to be a plant and she also 
the example of clocks she says can speak of a good clock or a bad and she says that 
good clock is one that tells time a bad clock does not tell time so she makes an argument 
how while much of morality is very contingent eventually slipping and sliding it meets reality it meets a kind 
foundation and that there you can develop moral principles against constraints you can speak of something that is good 
bad given the constraints condition on the constraints and so this is in essence what i argue about human 
given the need for us to live together given that we are social animals what equips us with that 
what makes it good nc so our capacity for love is good in that sense our capacity for friendship 
good in that sense and i help but notice that many of these qualities are good in the every 
meaning as well if you ask we care if you love yourself or are kind to yourself or are 
to yourself we care whether you love others or are kind to others or are just to others our 
are social virtues primarily and so we clearly have a connection between that which we think of as good 
good life or good practice or good behavior much of that not all of it we also for example 
think of bravery facing a violent animal for example so not social but we can think of that as 
moral virtue most of our virtues many of them are social in nature so sort of the argument that 
try to make at the end of the book and why i think that it is possible to provide 
least a partially biological foundation for morality sc yeah so i i think what you just said is extremely 
and understandable and i quite go not quite on the train and the reason why is i think very 
to draw a distinction between metaethics or metamorality i know why people use the word but what are the 
of morality that give its foundation its oomph or whatever versus morality and ethics themselves like okay so what 
the morals that we pick sc i think that biology and the constraints that get us here and the 
that we have as both individuals and social creatures clearly are going to have a huge impact on how 
decide to actually be moral what counts as being moral etcetera but the foundations of morality that follow from 
constraints or that biology you can always choose to be very different and no one can say that wrong 
the same way that they could say you were wrong if you were wrong about something scientific or logical 
i would like to encourage the world to just relax and accept the fact that morality have an absolute 
and nevertheless we have enough shared concerns and shared desires that we can construct a way to live that 
to us to be moral nc i disagree with that i would sign up for that i have to 
more about how you were framing the distinction between metamorality and moral rules because if anything initially when you 
expressing it that way i would have said that the biology could provide a foundation for the metamorality and 
culture or history would fill in the specific rules so for example not killing strangers might be something that 
selection might have shaped but who counts as a stranger might be something very culturally specific sc yeah so 
me both of those are morality so morality is that killing strangers is bad metamorality is why do we 
that killing strangers is bad nc i see sc the warrant what is the justification for that nc i 
sc and rather than being moral realist whether kantian or otherwise i just wanna be a moral constructivist and 
look we all think that figure out how to live nc okay so i get the point so there 
some arguments that evolutionary biologists have made like bret weinstein and others that actually what has evolved is not 
content of moral rules but even the capacity for moral deliberation in fact the argument is that what matters 
that we evolve to argue with each other that serves a purpose it binds us together the fact that 
for example fight kill each other necessarily as a first instance we just argue and that we might come 
different conclusions different groups of people endowed with the same capacity for argument might argue a lot and then 
the end come to different conclusions but the fact of arguing actually is giving an outlet for otherwise bad 
and also binding us together by giving us something to do nc so some people have even argued that 
very capacity for moral deliberation is itself an evolved property that we have so i understand i think what 
and i think crazy but i still think that you could be more charitable i think probably sc no 
a plucky minority here i think most people agree with me including most professional philosophers but just a matter 
nc before they come around sc i do yeah the words that using very similar to communicative rationality habermasian 
of thinking about how human beings interact and how we come to things and i think that we have 
even want in my less charitable moments to say that this is a relic of our religious upbringings the 
that we want to find this absolute bedrock logical geometric derivation of things rather than just saying come together 
agree about nc yes and no i would say to that i would say no doubt that modern moral 
owes a lot to theology religion clearly goes way back we know exactly how far back it is tens 
thousands of years but i also think that a lot of the stuff discussing these sort of moral sentiments 
titfortat or reciprocity for example the evolution of the sense of reciprocity that you see in elephants that that 
way back a prereligious sensibility that we humans have sc yeah but they have morality not chuckle they worry 
a foundational basis for their actions uniquely human right nc i would agree with that sc okay so when 
write a book like this why do you do it your audience are you reaching for the general public 
this something that you think of as part of your wider mission as an intellectual or is this just 
of your scholarly cv nc god a good question i would say that there are many different reasons one 
both painful and joyful to write a book sc oh my goodness nc yeah chuckle nc yeah it exercises 
certain part of your mind a kind of discipline i love the learning that goes into it you never 
anything as well as when you have to teach it and you really have to drill down and drill 
i love all the meandering paths and you stumble on stuff as you look at one references then another 
then another then you find this incredible classic some forgotten scholar in who saw things the right way nobody 
it you know incredible how smart those guys were and we think discovering everything so all of that is 
joyful but painful difficult to distill everything down to kill your darlings to articulate it to finish the project 
allocate the time all of that stuff so first is just personal satisfaction i like it this is my 
book my third unedited book also done some edited some clinical textbooks on hospice medicine so the first one 
second point i think the audience is my peers trying to make an argument trying to say to your 
trying to defend and advance a certain perspective on the world trying to say i think these ideas help 
organize our thinking and do you agree with me please agree with me that this is a healthy way 
think about and then i think as you alluded to i think also the broader public and here i 
that as academics we have i would even go so far as to say an obligation to serve the 
to advance the public understanding of science i think universities and academics are the institutions in our society that 
supposed to preserve produce and disseminate knowledge supposed to preserve sanskrit and preserve shell anatomy and preserve every obscure 
of human knowledge nc and supposed to disseminate it supposed to discover new stuff clearly a hugely important mission 
supposed to do that without reference to its utility because i think a mark of our civilization that we 
this we give money to institutions and people that just supposed to sit around and think up stuff i 
miraculous and i think a source of our wealth i could make an argument a source of our wealth 
power and has been ancient kings did the same thing galileo not forget was in the pay of the 
you know all of you know archimedes worked for the king of syracuse and so forth nc so supposed 
do that but also supposed to disseminate the knowledge and not supposed to just disseminate it to ourselves supposed 
do disseminate it back to our pay masters which are the society at large and so i think in 
regard i think the engagement with the public understanding of science and the effort to increase the way in 
people see the utility of science and of knowledge i think is important so another reason to write books 
yeah so i think very quickly before i nc well you think about those you do same thing of 
sc i do i was gonna say two things one just that this wonderful fact that you are allowed 
dive into the literature and the research and the other fields and to be interdisciplinary and to talk to 
outside this is a wonderful feature of writing books and i had it when i was writing the big 
my podcast audience here knows this but this was a major motivation for me starting mindscape podcast because when 
stopped writing that book my license to knock on doors went away well how do i get to talk 
nobel prize winning biologists now but now i can do it i have a podcast so here we are 
might want to start a podcast if you wanna do this and the other one nc i could never 
up with you though shawn i think doing it so just work doing it so well you and niles 
a big ecosystem out there and the other one yeah i think that very interesting to think about the 
and how we write books because especially in physics there is a wellestablished tradition of outreach popularization books where 
trying to to explain something that is perfectly well understood general relativity or particle physics or whatever and sort 
secretly it be secret i should be louder about it but my books mostly that my books are actually 
you said trying to make an argument and you can disagree with them for the most part not simply 
here is stuff here is why spacetime is curved nc let me explain to you at large sc yeah 
to say go beyond a little and partly i do it in the trade book format to reach a 
audience but partly because it is kind of a bigger picture more interdisciplinary thing that would be less appropriate 
a professional journal article nc yes i think right and i also think a way in i mean this 
a bit of the craft of being a professor at our stage of life i would say that i 
to take intellectual risks both in my own laboratory i like to say my students will say go to 
say this is crazy but gotta be sc oh yeah chuckle nc and more than of the time right 
take bets on whether right or not and i have a pretty good nose at this point for stuff 
but gotta be true and it very hard to publish that stuff in peer review journals as you know 
until you get all the right evidence this the path to proving something is what is it extraordinary claims 
extraordinary evidence so but with the books the thing you can do is that not peer reviewed nc so 
of the things that i find very very welcoming about writing a book is that while i stand behind 
in the book and i have thought deeply about it and researched it at length and of stuff are 
done in my own personal laboratory i know it down all the way to the bottom level going on 
nevertheless you have more breathing room you have those peer reviewers that are breathing over your neck and saying 
you say that or i disagree with because i says i disagree with that cut it out of the 
no i wanna see this so sc yeah and it gets worse the more interesting your work gets in 
sense you know i feel myself like ten or twenty years ago i was doing pretty darn mainstream cosmology 
gravitation theory and i never even contemplated the possibility that a paper that i wrote would get rejected just 
you do the solid work and get accepted and these days doing infinitely more interesting work but it is 
speculative more interdisciplinary and now always worried that half the time it sails through fine and other half the 
decided to be obstreperous but sadly and it really it hurts me to admit this but my opinion of 
has gone down in the last decade because as it affects me personally the fact that academia is so 
and traditionalist and sc is just much more obvious and a reason for that just like the evolution of 
human capacities sort of selection pressures that push it in that way but too bad that not more room 
there for encouraging just a little bit of off the beaten path kind of stuff and the reason why 
say reluctant to say it is it will give solace to all sorts of complete crackpots say my theory 
how the universe is made of pipe cleaners is absolutely being rejected by the establishment but so be nc 
more than that first of all i would agree with everything you just said in the last two minutes 
had a different career than yours in different fields and i know if ever overlapped in universities but mostly 
universities and the same thing and sometimes describe my laboratory as the island of lost toys chuckle nc gotten 
the point where i can provide some cover and protection for my students but i worry because i have 
and i have job security and i have reached a certain stage where i can take these risks but 
know i want to let them take their risk i wanna encourage them to and we all know the 
scientists that swam against the tide made those major discoveries but the truth of the matter is for every 
of those we know who either were wrong or they were right but they spend their whole life beating 
head against the wall and never recognized in their lifetime they were penniless and had no jobs and so 
even though they were right so we only hear about those outliers who were right and successful and very 
to organize a career or to mentor young people in this regard so i typically give the advice of 
i say develop technical expertise develop detailed knowledge about a narrow very conventional kind of thing and even though 
are young still have these crazy ideas that you pursue in parallel and just work harder do two careers 
you get to the point where you can really give yourself liberty to go off in crazy tangents nc 
these guys at mit these full professors you go to talk to them and like yeah this is the 
publishing and sell but let me show you the really cool chuckle nc over here in the back room 
their eyes light up i think talking now about different things talking about just a craft of mentoring young 
and also talking about having a good life in science and for me i would rather take risks that 
here let me just tell you this and sure you feel the same way once tasted at the well 
scientific discovery no no other feeling like it sc nothing like it yeah nc nothing like it if the 
to see something anything can be the tiniest damn thing and you have that feel my god look at 
thing that i laughter nc and nobody has thought of it before seen it before like a drug right 
just want it again and you will invest years for that again and so i try now that at 
stage where at and to allow myself that pursuit and a lot of my grants get rejected a lot 
my papers get rejected and i think more than yours judging from your hit rate you were describing but 
would at this stage of my life the game i would rather play sc well it seems like been 
it very successfully and at the very least we have our books and podcasts to fall back on nc 
thank you sc so a true a real intellectual pleasure to be discussing these ideas nc sean thank you 
much sc alright nicholas christakis thanks so much for being on the podcast nc thank you music great podcast 
prior research highlighted that the release of oxytocin modulates cooperation within and competition between groups so back to brain 
if you are in a group oxytocin is released and you are more likely to bond have empathy etc 
wise you tend to be circumspect of the tribe next door due partly to less neuropeptide activity so much 
learn and synthesize just a matter of time moral realism has its days numbered jokes apart it seems much 
plausible and evident that morality is not objective and innate even when it comes to basic principles and even 
crossculture ones human slaughters and massacres included however for the good of the world many of these principles in 
current times are universally accepted which is an essential thing if we want to remain collaborative and enhance this
