show episode transcript hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll the big news in mindscape 
as you may have heard is that opened a patreon account that is in other words a way that 
can send me money for me making podcasts this is something been thinking about for a while as much 
i love the podcasting and i do love it and i do it if i enjoy it and in 
ways an excuse for me to talk to interesting people about topics that i ordinarily get to think about 
also takes time and it even takes money and so forth so being recompensed in some way is a 
thing even though the podcast is relatively young already gotten a few emails from different people different companies who 
interested in placing ads on the podcast this is the traditional way that people can support their podcasting efforts 
host will read and add in the beginning or in the middle and talk about how wonderful this particular 
is or that particular pen knife or whatever it is that is being sold at the time i really 
moral objections to that how commerce works i advertise something that i like i would actually be very careful 
what it was that was being advertised but i do have some aesthetic worries i just like it better 
the podcast is nothing but the substance of what talking about and not being interrupted by ads so the 
behind the patreon is to replace the revenue that would come in from ads with just people giving money 
exchange for receiving the podcast so you can go to patreon patreoncomseanmcarroll or you can just go to the 
podcast homepage preposterousuniversecompodcast and links there to the patreon page and then you can pledge so what that means 
you agree to give a dollar or two dollars or five dollars or ten dollars or whatever amount of 
you want to pledge that will be for every individual episode so sometimes done per month or per time 
i absolutely promise that the rate of podcast is going to be exactly the same every month so i 
that more fair to charge per podcast so a dollar per podcast not that much you know it would 
ideal in my world if i could just charge everybody ten cents per episode of the podcast everyone who 
probably be making a lot more money than i would with ads or patreon or anything else but there 
no such system as far as i know to make that work maybe someday cryptocurrencies will let that happen 
paying me in bitcoin or something like that so see how this goes if i can make anywhere close 
the income from patreon that i would from ads then i would prefer to just stick with that and 
have ads but no promises trying things learning new at this so let me know what you think about 
and please if you like the podcast do think about going and pledging i completely understand if you sure 
many listeners have lower incomes than i do completely okay if you want to pledge a bit of a 
in a lot of minds to go sign up put in your paypal your credit card or whatever so 
guilting anyone into doing this this is completely optional completely voluntary nice it makes me feel good and it 
you feel good a way to give back to the podcast if enjoying it so i very much appreciate 
you do that i certainly appreciate those of you who have already signed up thank you very much it 
me feel like doing something good and makes me motivated to do more of it also a slightly more 
benefit involved in that going to try to do monthly or maybe once every two months and ask me 
in ama where subscribers can ask questions patreons in other words people pledged something and i will answer them 
the form of a podcast and it will be available exclusively to the supporters so for your dollar an 
or two dollars an episode or whatever you get to listen to me answer some questions about something in 
if you go to the patreon page there are tiers that they like tiers so you can pledge at 
level or at that level all of the levels get you the same rewards in my system not doing 
sort of complicated system where you get more and more goodies for more and more money because this is 
barebones operation that doing in my spare time here the amount of appreciation goes higher and higher the more 
that comes in but get the amas and get the feeling of satisfaction the other thing to announce is 
today we have a special show in that there are no guests this is a solo show just me 
the topic is a big one why does the universe exist why is there something rather than nothing why 
there anything at all i will give you an answer i will talk about various different answers this is 
the kind of question that is really straightforward to definitively answer in a way that everyone agrees but try 
sketch out some of the possibilities obviously a big question the very biggest questions why here at the mindscape 
so go music often asked when i first got interested in science or in physics or cosmology different people 
into a field like this in different ways some people discover it till rather late in college or something 
that other people discover it rather early i was in the very early camp i was a kid i 
that i was ten years old what i actually remember was that it was in fourth grade when my 
and so forth started talking about science in a more directed way not just whatever was going on in 
that day but i really became fascinated by it i know a lot of people became interested because of 
fiction because of movies and tv and books and whatever for me it was actually nonfiction books i would 
read books in the local public library which i haunted for many many hours and i would read books 
quarks and the big bang and general relativity and particle physics quantum mechanics and i said wanna do this 
is what i wanna do for a and it makes you think right you start thinking about these great 
never been exposed to before and i could usually think my way through and maybe not understand things perfectly 
at least come to some comfort level with the various words and ideas that were being batted around the 
that always sort of stuck me a little bit was why is the universe here at all when i 
fall asleep at night thinking about something that read in a cosmology book or whatever at some point my 
would come on to this question of if i even here what if the universe was not here what 
then that was it no more sleep for me that night that was the kind of thing that kept 
up at night that and big foot but a whole another story so this is a famous problem why 
universe exist why is there something rather than nothing a famous way of putting it not really an expert 
sure what it means to be an expert on this question i guess more expert than the average person 
on the physics side of things i am pretty well aware of the relevant issues and i enjoy talking 
reading about learning about the philosophical side of things and even the theological religious side of things so i 
invited to write an article write a paper about this a review paper invited by eleanor knox and alastair 
who are two philosophers of science to an upcoming volume called routledge companion to the philosophy of and foolishly 
said although a lot of fun after the fact your memories always correctly reflect how you were feeling at 
time while i was writing it it was a tremendous hassle but now that written it i remember it 
great fun so you can find the paper online on my website or elsewhere simply called is there something 
than and i thought that that will be a good topic to dive into for my first ever solo 
for a number of different reasons maybe the biggest reason being that sort of a representative topic for the 
of things that i wanna talk about as the podcast goes forward it absolutely requires that we take seriously 
union and certainly the intersection of physics but also philosophy and as i said religion because one of the 
is gonna be given for why the universe exists is that because god made the universe right gonna be 
popular answer you deny that so if you think about that is that the right answer what is the 
one way or the other does it hold up is it the best way of thinking about things so 
gonna do not the first one to talk about this of course in fact in very recent years the 
of topic that pops up if you go and google why is there something rather than nothing why does 
universe exists get plenty of hits and i think that been a misimpression that a lot of people have 
so part of the purpose of this particular discussion will be to correct some misimpressions and misimpression referring to 
the idea that advances in modern physics have answered the question why does the universe exist answered it in 
way that been answered before and i think just wrong i think that is not true advances in modern 
have shed light on what it means to ask the question they have given us new ways of thinking 
what would qualify as an answer but they have not told us what the answer is in particular a 
motto that goes around saying reason why something rather nothing is because nothing is and this has something to 
with the quantum vacuum state so here to tell you that does not answer this question that interested in 
motto is was invented by frank wilczek nobel prize winning physicist and he really referring to the question of 
a universe at all he was referring to the question of why there is matter in the universe in 
why there is more matter than antimatter and you can try to explain that we know what the right 
to that question is but you can try to explain it in terms of the instability of certain quantum 
a perfectly sensible thing to do but why there are quantum states why a universe at all why space 
is completely unrelated to this particular thought that was in frank mind so a brilliant guy he understood this 
he knows what talking about but in boiling it down to a motto i think that its applicability got 
little lost so not the answer in fact i think if there is any answer to the question of 
is there something rather than nothing the answer is there an answer the answer is that the issue of 
existence of the universe is not the kind of thing to which we can attach why questions and why 
this is why of course it becomes a little bit of philosophy that we talked about do you mean 
why what do you mean by something and and this kind of discussion might very well be frustrating or 
to you i get that no problems with that sympathetic this discussion is largely not gonna be for you 
not that interested in a very careful rigorous parsing of the meaning of these questions and how they could 
be applicable the work we have to do to try to understand what the possible answers could be to 
there is something rather than nothing so the plan for this discussion gonna talk about what it means to 
why something is true why something is the case then gonna talk about what it means for there to 
something rather than nothing and then we can talk about some of the more downtoearth physics concern some of 
ideas that we do have after all the universal based laws of physics so what the laws of physics 
and how they apply to the universe are certainly going to be relevant when you talk about why something 
than nothing even if they provide a onceandforall answer okay so the background with that background in mind we 
think about the question the kind of question that is so big and obvious right why is there a 
at all why does reality exist you might have thought this was hotly debated two thousand five hundred years 
that in the athenian flowering of science and philosophy plato and aristotle probably bandied about this question and offered 
dialogues or extensive treatises about it but no actually as far as i can tell this was just not 
question they chose to address they had different opinions about how the universe came to be plato had his 
of the demiurge and so forth aristotle invented his idea of the unmoved mover which is basically god but 
issue of like maybe the universe have existed or might not have existed and was not really a hot 
back then it until leibniz in the century gottfried wilhelm leibniz one of the codiscoverers of calculus along with 
newton leibniz was a very influential philosopher and physicist even though the word physicist that popular back in the 
it was leibniz who first posed the question in the modern form why is there something rather than nothing 
was later dubbed the primordial existential question and a good one we can ask it anyway we demand that 
is a satisfactory answer this is gonna be part of my sales pitch here perfectly good to ask questions 
this but when you are dealing at that very boundaries of knowledge the things that we have familiarity with 
our everyday lives what you do is simply insist before you even dig into the question that going to 
the kind of thing going to give you the kind of answer used to i mean why would it 
very different kind of question that we ordinarily faced with in our daytoday lives leibniz in particular had a 
hidden agenda it very hidden it was an open agenda he was trying to develop an idea that he 
called the principle of sufficient reason the principle of sufficient reason is basically the bumper sticker that you can 
that says happens for a basically he says that anything that occurs in the world does so for a 
reason a reason why now this is one of those things that seems reasonable right now when we see 
happen they just randomly happen there seems to be a pattern and orderliness to nature so things happen for 
why and leibniz says this is a rule he says in other words not just something we happen to 
that things happen for reasons something that will always be true an absolute foundational principle of how reality works 
if you say that then of course the existence of the universe is something that has a reason the 
happens it exists so leibniz says clearly a reason why the universe happens so leibniz and his philosophy was 
what the reason why is god god created the a very simple answer now as very clever sophisticated highly 
century thinkers sure sitting there thinking wait a minute what is the reason that god exists there a worry 
an infinite regress and leibniz thought of this way ahead of you he says no no god is his 
the unique thing about god unlike the universe which may or may not have existed god necessarily exists so 
is the one thing that need an external reason need a reason other than himself god is his own 
for existing and he is the reason for everything else existing so if you can buy that if you 
buy into this framework it is at least consistent right at least selfcontained it does provide answers to the 
that imposed not necessarily been a very popular idea since then it depends on your attitude towards other questions 
speaking if religious this sounds like a good strategy everything needs a reason the reason is god reason is 
own self people like david hume scoffed at the idea later on the famous scottish philosopher david hume who 
one of my intellectual mentors in some sense david hume was someone i think that much of when i 
encountered him in college but then again i went to a catholic university and we studied the parts of 
hume that were less interesting and now i realize in my old age that hume was right about a 
of things you can learn a lot by reading david hume and hume just says i see any reason 
there should be a necessary being how do you know that something like god is a necessary and hume 
out he spend a lot of time on it but his basic argument which i think is correct is 
all of your arguments in favor of the idea that god is a necessary being basically are circular they 
come down to the idea that you insist that everything has a reason that nothing can just be if 
insist on that then the universe can just be and if you do insist on that then cooking the 
if you insist that everything has a reason then yes you get to this result but maybe some things 
for reasons maybe there necessary beings and this has been a widely accepted point of view among at least 
philosophers and thinkers ever since then bertrand russell the century philosopher put it very straightforwardly he said think the 
is just there and all a brute fact all there really is to and basically the position going to 
myself but i should know that there is sort of a middle ground on one extreme you have there 
a definite definable pointable reason for the universe existing god or something else and on the other side of 
spectrum you have it just is stop asking questions in between you have the universe have to exist in 
particular way but there is something nice about the universe as it is there is something special maybe more 
beautiful better this way of the universe existing than not of course then you reach that question why should 
universe obey that principle of elegance or simplicity or whatever it is but you know maybe a brute fact 
little bit a slight shift of where the brute facts are from the existence of the universe to the 
that the universe satisfies the kind of criterion that it enables so the history in a nutshell very very 
a lot of people talking about this you see them talk about it more and more when the century 
along and opinions differ you will not be surprised to learn not everyone agrees so given that history lay 
of the ground work be a little bit more careful about what we mean by why something might exist 
other words what asking is what do you mean when you ask why something is the case what is 
kind of answer that would possibly satisfy you right and this is a hard question all had or at 
witnessed the experience of a little kid asking some why questions is the sky and someone says the light 
the sun is reflected differently whether blue or and the kid says why is the light deflected and you 
because of the molecular structure of the molecules in the air and how they interact with guess what the 
can say why is the molecular structure that and you can talk about equation if you wanted to but 
you just say asking these questions it just is that way so gonna call this the little kid problem 
any answer to the question why are things one way you can always ask why is that true why 
that the this is what leibniz was trying to wriggle around by saying that is the end the buck 
at god necessary and not allowed to ask why he exists he exists for his own but if you 
that option to go to then you can just always keep asking more and more questions in the paper 
call this the problem of explanatory regression why is this true because of something why is that true because 
something else and it goes potentially infinitely far sometimes people like aristotle said have an infinite chain of causes 
things are not sure why right not sure why you have an infinite chain but not gonna dig into 
particular debates right now so a problem that when you have an answer to the why question there might 
be another why question that pops up but putting aside that problem just look at the individual answers so 
it down to earth forget about the universe say that the doorbell rings you open the door and someone 
carrying a pizza so you ask your partner is there a person here carrying a pizza at our a 
why question that you might be confronted with in your everyday life and if you think about it there 
be many many answers to that sort of an obvious answer because i ordered a right a possible answer 
you could be a little bit more specific i called in a certain way on the phone the pizza 
i went on the but what about things like i was what about things like we live in a 
system where allowed to exchange money for goods and what about things like spacetime is and if spacetime were 
fourdimensional maybe there be any such thing as pizza and it have arrived right maybe because gravity is attractive 
if gravity were repulsive we have planets and therefore we be able to deliver pizzas if this kind of 
stickler about what the why questions might be which by the way as professionally called a philosopher if that 
of person then you see a multiplicity of possible answers to a simple question like why is there someone 
the door carrying a pizza and of course aristotle knew this way back in the day so aristotle famously 
between different kinds of reasons why different things happen different kinds of causes usually called and i wanna go 
that you know not here to debate aristotle or anything like that but for the purposes of our discussion 
why the universe exists it is nevertheless useful to distinguish between two different possible kinds of answers one kind 
answer would be the mechanism that might bring something into existence right in the case of the universe in 
you might have a physics theory that explains why the universe came to be through the workings out of 
laws of physics that would be a mechanism that brings the universe into existence as opposed to that or 
least next to that there is the reason why that particular mechanism worked at all if you have a 
that explains the big bang why the universe came into existence well why is that mechanism right right this 
the more traditional i think sense of why the universe came into existence so these roughly correspond to this 
of a mechanism and a reason correspond roughly to what aristotle called the efficient cause and the final cause 
are details that are different which is why not getting into aristotle but i think that for the purposes 
the discussion it is important to discuss both the mechanisms that could have brought the universe into existence if 
and the reasons why that might have happened in a particular way that it did not be surprised to 
that talking about mechanisms is relatively straightforward a physics problem what happened at the big bang before the big 
are there more than one big bangs these are not easy questions but they lie squarely within the realm 
what we know and love as physics as cosmology we know how to talk about these there are probably 
involved in them the idea of reasons why the reason why this particular mechanism worked the reason why the 
is one way rather than another is harder this is something that is not in the wheelhouse of what 
do for a living physicists can say is attractive because of the sign of constant in the equations of 
if you say why what is the reason why constant has a certain they might say it has to 
with the stability of the vacuum state the theory or something like but if you keep asking these why 
like a little kid eventually just say just how it is those are the laws of physics that we 
the reason for this the reason for the existence of reasons in this particular way is that according to 
lights of modern physics what you and i in our everyday life know as a reason the pizza guy 
because i ordered pizza i was hungry that is not fundamental to how the universe works unlike what leibniz 
in mind where the fundamental nature of reality is a story of things happening for particular reasons that is 
how modern physics talks about the universe modern physics talks about the universe in terms of laws of physics 
are patterns you start somewhere you start with a particular state the universe with all the stuff in it 
different things and then i give you an equation that says from this stuff gonna happen true whether isaac 
of motion or equations or equation or equation this is the paradigm that physics works under and at the 
level the answer to every why question why did a person carrying pizza arrive at my door well because 
the laws of physics and the initial conditions for the universe at the big bang a possible answer you 
give that your partner will not be satisfied with that particular answer if demanding to know why a pizza 
arrived you just say the laws of physics plus the initial conditions of the big not gonna be sharing 
pizza with a happy partner if gonna be the case the actual reasons that we know and love that 
would say in a more intuitive everyday situation are emergent they are not fundamental so if talking about the 
laws of physics speaking a language of patterns of this happens then that happens then that happens then that 
how the laws of physics work all the talk that we give about reasons why are at a higher 
of description i talk about this a lot in my book the big picture an approximation a useful way 
talking about the world and sort of a coarse grained approximate way the human scale reality is one where 
of reasons why makes perfect sense i ordered the pizza i was hungry even though words like hungry are 
to be found in the fundamental laws of physics now some people will argue that it be that way 
just remove reasons why from the fundamental laws of nature because if you do then all hell breaks loose 
just chaos and anything can happen right you have no explanation for why one thing happens rather than another 
the distinction trying to draw not that anything can happen not that there are no rules that the rules 
we call the laws of nature have a very particular form all they do is say this then that 
this is the case now then that will be the case a moment they say why this was ever 
case they say why the case that things evolved in that way just a rule for chugging along what 
in the universe as time passes so you can ask why are the rules that way we know that 
very very much subject to the little kid problem why is the universe why are the rules one way 
than some other way you can keep asking that why question so my point is that the kinds of 
to questions is this the the kinds of answers that used to getting in our everyday context the pizza 
i ordered it i ordered it i was hungry those kinds of answers might not be available to us 
asking questions about the nature of the universe itself those kinds of answers are part of a tool kit 
we have for everyday lives for the emergent level of behavior for human scale things we have no right 
demand that the same kind of reasons the same kind of vocabulary has any applicability at all to questions 
is there a universe what happened at the big bang why are the laws of physics the way they 
might be answers to those questions just saying we have the right to demand it we have to be 
minded see what happens when we dig into what those laws are okay so my background about what does 
mean to ask for a reason why when we can and cannot actually do that now go to the 
of what does it mean to say something versus nothing right what do you mean to ask when you 
about why does the universe exist and here again two sort of subquestions that aiming at one is the 
of we look at the universe we can think of the universe as space space is the arena where 
happen right here someone else is over there there are planets and stars up there and stuff in the 
me planets stars and so forth and you can ask is there right you could define nothingness as not 
absence of the universe but as simply empty space in some sense if we had space but no stuff 
it that would be a kind of nothingness it would be like the vacuum in some sense right maybe 
question of why there is matter in the universe this is kind of the question that wilczek was getting 
when he said nothing is one kind of question the second kind is why is there a universe at 
why is there space itself forget why stuff in space why are there three dimensions of space not just 
ten dimensions but why are there dimensions of space at all this is harder the second question is probably 
people have in mind when leibniz or hume or russell or whatever when they say this question about why 
universe exists why there is something rather than nothing but harder and therefore there is a common strategy among 
who claimed to have answered the question of why there is something rather than nothing which is that really 
why there is stuff inside the universe not why there is a universe at all these are both interesting 
so we can talk about them a little bit but just be clear going on we wanna claim credit 
answering one question when really addressing another one the why is there stuff in space versus why is there 
at all so what do we mean by space right i mean this is you know at this level 
carefulness and asking these questions some of the easiest most obvious things that you think familiar with need a 
bit more careful consideration to make sure we know what talking about after all there was this guy isaac 
who gave us a wonderful theory of physics called classical mechanics i think he called it that maybe he 
i know but newtonian mechanics sometimes called one of the features of newtonian classical mechanics is that again stuff 
space evolving with time and that space and time are both themselves absolute something called space absolutely agreed upon 
objective everyone agrees on what space is everyone agrees on where things are how moving through the universe there 
an absolute notion of where you are in the universe in newtonian spacetime so if you naively take paradigm 
gave us equations right he said how gravity works how inertia and forces work and so he gave us 
for saying given some stuff scattered through space how does it evolve with time time itself is absolute just 
space so again naively and i keep saying naively because these are theories right newtonian mechanics is a theory 
by newton you might imagine ways to tweak the theory to slightly change it okay so when i say 
i mean what is the most straightforward direct implication at face value of a theory like this not that 
is an absolute necessary part of that theory anyway naively theory implies the universe is eternal space and time 
are they exist time extends from past infinity to future infinity nothing in equations that says the universe has 
begin or end stuff moving in the universe and that will just keep moving forever and ever the straightforward 
of equation now newton himself not sure if he did believe that or not i know whether i know 
he thought that god was responsible for the universe i know that newton was very religious in this sense 
he was very happy to talk about how god had something to do with the universe not just bringing 
into being i mean part of what he said was that the beauty of classical mechanics of this framework 
invented was so beautiful it had to be design but he also believed that maybe it quite beautiful enough 
was smart enough to know that the kinds of questions he was interested in were planets moving in the 
system right explaining the motion of the planets in the sky and he was smart enough to know that 
his theory unlike his predecessors kepler and copernicus and so forth not only did the planets move in the 
field of the sun but the planets had their own gravitational fields so they would influence each other so 
simply orbit the sun forever they would nudge each other off of their orbits ultimately the solar system should 
unstable so newton actually thought that god would occasionally come in and clean things up that he would fix 
orbits of the planets to keep them going for however long that was necessary again that was part of 
thought that was not popular later on pierresimon laplace circa the year was very definite that he thinks that 
universe can be explained without an interventionist god that the universe can simply obey the rules of classical newtonian 
these rules by the way change that much for our present purposes when it comes to one thousand nine 
five when albert einstein puts the final finishing touches on the special theory of relativity you may have heard 
special relativity says that space and time are not absolute anymore they are part of one fourdimensional thing called 
and true but in special relativity spacetime is absolute so you might not agree on where you are in 
but everyone agrees on where they are in spacetime and furthermore that spacetime is just a background there we 
live in it and again straightforwardly if you obey the equations spacetime exists forever it goes from the past 
to future infinity so special relativity really change the question why is there something rather than nothing in either 
relativity or classical newtonian mechanics just a posit that here you go this is space or spacetime and stuff 
it and going there was really no explanatory apparatus that you could reach for within the theory itself that 
change ten years after special relativity when einstein put the finishing touches on general relativity in the general theory 
relativity now spacetime is still very important the difference is that spacetime is now dynamical in general relativity spacetime 
not a mute fixed unchanging background on which everything else happens spacetime is a player in the game the 
of gravity in the general relativistic way of looking at things is a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime 
when you have matter and energy that forces spacetime to curve when you have curved spacetime that pushes around 
matter and energy in what you and i know as the law of gravity an apple falls from a 
would say because the earth is curving the spacetime in the vicinity of the apple so a little bit 
an important change for our present purposes right in general relativity spacetime is not this separate thing not just 
stage on which the drama is being played out an actor in the drama itself and it take too 
in the people realized that the universe is expanding right edwin hubble and his collaborators showed that not only 
galaxies moving away from us which everyone knew hubble measured the distances to these galaxies and discovered that galaxies 
are further away are moving away from us faster in other words the universe as a whole is getting 
and everyone instantly realized if you wind the clock backwards if things are moving away toward the future they 
closer in the past and there was a solution to equation that said know what everything is just gonna 
in the past some number of years everything in the universe is on top of everything else georges lemaitre 
belgian priest who was one of the founders of this idea called it the primeval atom and today we 
it the big bang that moment which we now know was about fourteen billion years ago when everything that 
know about in the observable universe was in the same place according to the equations of general relativity the 
bang is a beginning if you trace what happens backward in time unlike in newtonian mechanics or special relativity 
general relativity there is a singularity past which you can no longer push the equations it is no longer 
in general relativity that just because here now and stuff in the universe and moving around that stuff was 
here there can be a moment in time when the universe comes into existence and the pope at the 
said this is brilliant this is just what god said in the bible and he asked lemaitre to sort 
justify the creation story in genesis using these new cosmological discoveries and lemaitre said that is a very bad 
so what if tomorrow someone invents a new theory where the big bang was not the beginning of everything 
be in so he knew better than to do that whether or not you have a religious implication of 
circa the story seemed to be the universe had a finite age only a finite number of years between 
beginning of the universe and now and now we know that number is about fourteen billion years what we 
is whether or not that was the beginning because an implication of general relativity under the right assumptions but 
relativity might not be right general relativity include quantum mechanics we need a quantum theory of gravity maybe there 
extra dimensions of space maybe there are multidimensional brains moving in some string theory construction many people including myself 
the way have proposed scenarios where the big bang is the beginning of our local observable region of the 
but not the beginning of the universe as a whole so we know is the answer to the question 
the universe have a beginning in general relativity maybe the big bang was the beginning talk about this in 
little bit more detail later there is a theorem that is sometimes bandied about the bordeguthvilenkin theorem these are 
friends arvind borde alan guth alex vilenkin some cosmologists in the northeastern united states and they were interested in 
question of can inflation go on forever inflation is a theory wherein in the very very early universe there 
a tiny moment of time when the universe underwent a hyper fast period of accelerated expansion so just like 
discovered our universe is doing today back then there was this dark energy essentially that was incredibly dense incredibly 
pushing the universe apart causing this thing called inflation and then inflation would end that dark energy would convert 
ordinary matter and energy and you and i would see that as the hot big bang that we know 
love inflationary cosmology what guth and vilenkin and some other people worked out is that inflation can end in 
regions of the universe but it have to end everywhere it can end here but it can keep going 
places so they invented what is called eternal inflation even if inflation ended for us somewhere else still going 
even today and they asked the question this be also true in the eternal inflation is eternal toward the 
was it also eternal toward the past so they wrote down and proved a theorem that said that according 
the rules of classical spacetime whether or not einstein was right about how classical spacetime behaves as long as 
believe in the existence of classical spacetime inflation cannot be eternal to the past so there had to be 
singularity back there rather than just an eternally inflating universe now if you google the bordeguthvilenkin theorem the large 
of references to it are not from cosmologists or other physicists they are in theological contexts because people are 
this as a theorem a proof that the universe had a beginning that is completely wrong the bordeguthvilenkin theorem 
not prove the universe had a beginning it just proves that inflation was not eternal toward the past it 
completely compatible with the theorem that the universe bounced at some point in the past that we live in 
baby universe that came out of something else that we live in a cyclic universe that bounces over and 
again many different possibilities all of which are eternal and completely compatible with the bordeguthvilenkin theorem so is the 
to the question the universe come into if it did then be forgiven for thinking a good reason to 
something started it right if the universe started something started it is a very natural way of thinking it 
not be true but a natural place to go in your thinking but if it lasted forever then a 
tempting place to go honestly we know which one is true the other thing of course is that the 
theorem refers to classical spacetime that is to say even if there are quantum mechanical particles in the universe 
treat the universe itself the spacetime in which we live the spacetime that obeys the rules of general relativity 
classical as something definitely there no uncertainty principle no superpositions or anything like that we most of us know 
of us accept the obviously true fact that not right that ultimately spacetime itself is going to be quantum 
just like everything else so what do we say when we have to combine quantum mechanics with curved spacetime 
answer there is that we know sorry be telling you things that we know but this is what life 
like on the cutting edge of theoretical physics and cosmology sometimes we have to be honest that we know 
answer to things so quantum gravity is something we have the answer to in fact if really honest about 
quantum mechanics is something that we really have the answer to quantum mechanics came along in final form in 
and a very very good theory for predicting the results of experiments as sure heard quantum mechanics says that 
you predict the results of experiments you get a probability not something definite you say a chance the spin 
be clockwise or or something like that very good we can predict all these experiments we can use it 
technology we can predict the existence of the higgs boson we can go and find it we can build 
and transistors and so forth all based on the predictions of quantum mechanics what we have is an understanding 
what quantum mechanics really says this is the topic of a book working on right now called something deeply 
which should be out in the fall of and sure as time goes on be returning to the question 
quantum mechanics here on mindscape over and over again a fascinating topic intrinsically and certainly to me what i 
when i say understand is we can give predictions for certain very particular situations that will appear that will 
up in an experimental laboratory but we tell you what is actually going on so we can say i 
at an electron that is spinning and i measure its spin measure it to be spinning clockwise or counterclockwise 
a certain but if someone says what do you mean by measure what exactly happens when you measure it 
it really evolving differently depending on whether i measure it or these are questions we know the answer to 
because we have answers but because we agree on what the answers are as sure i will discuss in 
podcasts a proponent of the everett or manyworlds version of quantum mechanics which is a terrible name for marketing 
i like the name for descriptive purposes but really it should just be called quantum the manyworlds approach says 
is a quantum wave function and there is nothing else and a schrodinger equation and there is nothing else 
simplest most strippeddown version of quantum mechanics now not gonna pitch everettian manyworlds quantum mechanics to you right here 
mentioning it because as soon as you start talking about things like stuff popping into existence out of nothing 
the quantum vacuum being unstable you have to have an idea about what quantum mechanics is you can no 
be agnostic about these important foundational questions so when i talk about quantum mechanics over the course of the 
few minutes it will be implicitly in this everettian point of view but hopefully that matter too much for 
that we say the point is that in quantum mechanics we describe stuff not by particles with positions and 
but by called the the wave function in quantum mechanics is effectively we use it as a tool to 
the probability of getting various different outcomes when you look for the location of electron where is it gonna 
you use the wave function to calculate the probability some people will say all it is just a tool 
calculating probabilities a good everettian will say the wave function is an exact representation of reality itself what reality 
a wave fine we need to debate that right now the point is a wave function of what so 
quantum mechanics first came along people were interested in electrons orbiting in atoms so you would have a wave 
for an electron you would have the very first version of this formalism that was written down by schrodinger 
schrodinger wrote down the famous schrodinger equation and he was just dealing with one electron moving around the nucleus 
an atom and there you can ask the question going back to our actual topic here can things appear 
of nothing is there a reason why things happen in the nonrelativistic original baby schrodinger equation just describing one 
moving in some force field of electromagnetism and electrons never come and go in that version of quantum mechanics 
downtoearth version there is one electron if you observe it you will see it somewhere and the whole story 
is no special help given to us in this question of why the universe exists however we know better 
that of course more than one particle in the universe for example there are fields in the universe the 
field the gravitational field and so forth eventually physicists realized that what we thought were particles like electrons and 
quarks and so forth everything you and i know and love as a particle is actually a vibration in 
sort of quantum mechanical field so not only is there an electric field and a magnetic field which when 
vibrate give us photons when you observe them there is a neutrino field which when it vibrates we see 
neutrino when an electron field and then when it vibrates an electron and so forth so the modern best 
of the universe is called quantum field theory quantum field theory describes the universe as a bunch of gently 
fields filling all of space surrounding you you yourself are an interacting bundle of gently vibrating quantum fields i 
that makes you feel good about yourself the great thing about quantum field theory is that it can describe 
only the existence of particles as we observe them but the creation and destruction of particles you can make 
when we discover the higgs boson at the large hadron collider you actually see the higgs itself it decays 
quickly it changes into other particles and we see those decay products what can be described by the formalism 
quantum field theory how particles change into each other or even how particles are just created out of supposedly 
so you see how all this digression is coming back into our topic that talking about here in the 
of quantum field theory you can very easily imagine evolution according to laws of physics that starts with empty 
space where if lived there you would look around and not see any particles and in the ordinary evolution 
things particles would come to be this is what frank wilczek had in mind when he said nothing is 
all comes down to again not that anything can happen if you were in empty space you need to 
that suddenly particles are gonna pop into existence they happen under the right circumstances so the subtlety here is 
definition of the phrase when physicists talk about empty space usually what they mean is the vacuum of a 
mechanical theory and not a machine that cleans up your room the vacuum is just empty space in particular 
is the lowest energy state in a quantum field theory if you imagine you have empty space that has 
energy may be zero or depending on how you define things if you add a particle to it to 
a different state now more energy so vacuum the technical definition of empty space is the state of lowest 
the thing where nothing going on but interestingly there can be temporary lowest energy states in other words you 
have a state that looks like the lowest energy state but secretly it can evolve these are called false 
states this is what would drive that period of inflation that we talked about if there were a state 
false vacuum that could make the universe accelerate and then suddenly all of its energy got converted to particles 
would see particles coming into existence where there been any particles before that is a certainly coming close to 
we have in mind when asking this question is there stuff in the universe than not so all of 
leads up to me saying that may very well be true so if what you care about is why 
there stuff in the universe then the answer might very well be found in the laws of physics as 
understand them now in quantum field theory in the cosmological applications to quantum field theory the kind of question 
can answer however you might be more ambitious than that you might wanna know not just why do particles 
into existence out of empty space you might wanna say does empty space come into and where we get 
little bit more wild so take a breath congratulate ourselves on coming to some understanding of why there might 
matter in the universe but now start talking about why the universe itself so the question in front of 
is can the universe simply be all by itself even if the universe has a beginning so again been 
little bit agnostic about whether or not the big bang really is the beginning of the universe but we 
still ask the question whether or not the universe had a beginning does it need a cause does the 
need something outside to bring it into existence so the physics here is that there are two very different 
for the universe on its largest scale description according to the rules of quantum mechanics of course always possible 
quantum mechanics itself is wrong every theory of physics has a chance of being wrong we should be open 
about that but if a quantum mechanics is wrong then we have no clue going on the current state 
physics is zero evidence that quantum mechanics is wrong in any way so go with quantum mechanics as our 
so equation is the equation we use to describe a system according to the rules of quantum mechanics and 
works for literally any quantum mechanical system there are different versions of equation for electrons for quantum fields for 
universe itself and what equation is is basically the quantum replacement for isaac equation that say fma right force 
mass times acceleration you push something it accelerates in a certain way the thing that equation does is it 
you give it a quantum mechanical system how going to evolve and the relevant question for our present purposes 
the existence of the universe is is the energy of the this might not be what you thought you 
being asked but this is what is actually very relevant equation acts very differently depending on whether the energy 
the universe is zero or nonzero and you might think easy been in the universe seen some things that 
energy so pretty sure the energy of the universe is not a little bit too quick of course since 
the whole universe not just the stuff in the universe that matters but also spacetime itself the curvature of 
according to general relativity and that counts when we count up the energy of the universe and very plausible 
sure but in certain very very plausible versions of cosmological physics the energy of the universe is exactly zero 
the universe is closed for example if the spatial topology of the universe is like a sphere or a 
or something like that if the universe is finite in extent then the straightforward application of what we know 
general relativity seems to imply that the energy of the universe is exactly zero we know if right by 
way very easy for that straightforward marriage of general relativity and quantum mechanics to not be right very possible 
universe is not closed so there are two possibilities that are very much on the table a universe with 
and a universe without and they have very different implications for the question of where the universe came from 
the universe has energy that is not zero and quantum mechanics is right so equation is right then it 
directly that the universe has lasted forever something called the quantum eternity theorem i named it that nobody else 
it that but just like equations equation just says the universe continues forever both from minus infinity in the 
to plus infinity in the future if on the other hand the energy of universe is exactly zero then 
is a puzzling thing that happens where there is no such thing as time a problematic thing when trying 
understand when the universe came to existence if actually no time itself so what equation says is how the 
evolves as time passes and what it says about a universe with zero energy is that such a universe 
it change stationary now again you might look around and say like been in the universe and seen things 
therefore that be but again aha you need to be a little bit more clever than that people who 
studied this version of the schrodinger equation which is sometimes called the wheelerdewitt equation after two famous physicists who 
it in the context of cosmology a universe with zero energy and therefore no obvious time evolution can actually 
sort of hidden time evolution just like reasons why things happen or emergent in our macroscopic world time evolution 
also be emergent in our macroscopic world the point is you should think about what you mean when you 
the time is evolving something is happening and you look at a clock and the clock says a certain 
and this is going on in the and then oh the clock says a different time something and something 
is going on in the universe and this happens on and on an infinite number of times what we 
by time evolution down at the level of what we actually see time evolution is a correlation between some 
read out on clocks and some configuration of stuff in the universe so in quantum mechanics things can exist 
superpositions like that electron that we were looking at it can exist in a superposition of spinning clockwise and 
counterclockwise so imagine the whole universe a whole bunch of stuff scattered throughout space in some configuration and a 
of clocks reading out a bunch of different times one configuration of the universe another configuration where stuff is 
else and the clocks read different things and another configuration where the stuff is in yet a different place 
the clocks read yet different things and in quantum mechanics the universe the reality of it all is not 
one of those but perhaps it could be a superposition of all of them so rather than in this 
of view the universe being described as something changing through time the universe could be a superposition of all 
moments of time in the same description very tempting to say at or the same so try to avoid 
temptations using temporallyladen language where not actually applicable so the universe could be all moments at once the universe 
be everything that might happen in a single unified description and if the case then no implication that the 
lasted forever if the moments of time that are read out by a clock are emergent are good approximations 
a certain regime where we can talk about them then the number of such moments of time might be 
the thing we would expect to be true if the big bang really were the beginning of the universe 
time has a beginning in the straightforward sense easier to accommodate that in quantum mechanics if the universe has 
energy time is emergent anyway then you can have a first moment of time now in either case we 
two cases on the table one is the universe has energy and it will last forever the other is 
universe has no energy and finite in time time is emergent in either one of these cases this is 
punch line pay attention neither one of these cases is there any implication that there needs to be something 
the universe that brings it into existence in both cases a universe that lasts forever or a universe that 
a beginning a finite moment of time the description of what is happening in the universe is completely selfcontained 
laws of physics being obeyed by everything all the time so even though sort of easier to see as 
alluded to earlier sort of easier to see in the eternal case where things have always existed not this 
that they sort of were created at any one moment in the case where time itself has a beginning 
you had this temptation to say a beginning a creation and therefore there must be a creator there must 
something or to put it a little bit more colorfully you say if telling me the universe popped into 
at some moment of time you got to tell me why it popped into existence things just pop into 
the answer is you say the words popped into existence not the right way of talking about it when 
say the words pop into existence already assuming that time exists right assuming a moment when there is no 
and then suddenly a moment when not in the scenario where the universe has a beginning where the big 
is the start there was no moment before the big bang the big bang was just the first moment 
pop into existence just that if you think about it from now going backwards rather than before the universe 
forwards if you start from now and go backwards you hit an end and it and it makes sense 
retrospect that this can happen in the case where the universe has zero energy remember energy is conserved in 
sense what that means is the amount of energy in the universe is the same at every moment of 
so if in a universe that has energy that in some sense that universe has to exist forever nowhere 
the energy to go if one moment that describes a universe with energy in it there has to be 
a succeeding moment immediately afterward and a preceding moment immediately before if the universe has zero energy then time 
end then there can be a moment and no creation of anything because the total energy of the universe 
zero nothing came into existence that always had been there before so we need a creator for the universe 
to the laws of physics now you might wanna go deeper right you might say not about the laws 
physics man about deep metaphysical principles and my deep metaphysical principles include something like the principle of sufficient reason 
everything that happens needs a so even if you can have physics equations that describe the universe as a 
system that explain the universe and you know maybe i mean so a possible way to go but not 
so let me give you very very briefly my reasons why i think a necessary direction to go down 
point is as we alluded to do there need to be reasons why things happen i told you i 
to convince you that what we understand from physics is that we can describe the universe even if it 
a beginning or eternal in the selfcontained way we need anything outside so you do need a reason why 
that case well usually the argument that you do need an external reason why is simply that a contingent 
a universe that exists as a brute fact without any other explanation violates some cherished metaphysical principle like the 
of sufficient reason the way to get out of it is to imagine there is a necessary being that 
being is usually identified with god and then existence the existence of that necessary being explains why the universe 
so then you have to explain why we should believe in a necessary being and again not gonna go 
the details here let me remind you for those of you who went to catholic universities like i did 
you heard all the different arguments for the existence of god from aquinas and others there is a cosmological 
which is basically just a repetition of the idea that everything that happens needs to happen for a reason 
something is here there needs to be a reason if that thing exist there must be a reason for 
you have an infinite number of reasons therefore it ends in god as tried to say before this just 
the question of whether you actually do need reasons if trying to discuss whether or not things can simply 
as brute facts than starting with the assertion we all agree that everything that happens needs a is not 
effective counter strategy another famousinfamous version of getting to a necessary being which is called the ontological argument which 
back to saint anselm and says can conceive of a most perfect different formulations but the basic idea we 
conceive of something that is absolutely perfect and then it says having the quality of existing is more perfect 
not having the quality of existing therefore if we can conceive of the most perfect being the most perfect 
must probably not doing justice to this argument a hilarious argument no one has ever been convinced by this 
many people have believed that true but they already believed in the conclusion from the start many ways out 
the ontological argument of this idea that we can conceive of the most perfect being existence is more perfect 
nonexistence therefore the being must exist necessarily my favorite way out which is not that popular in the philosophy 
is just to say we conceive of the most perfect you think you can but maybe you can think 
can conceive of the largest prime number but you because there any such thing right maybe you think you 
conceive of a circle that we can square a circle that we can actually geometrically manipulate into a square 
using compasses and straightedges but we you really conceive of that because we have theorem that no such thing 
the point is very easy to fool ourselves into thinking we can conceive of something that is just not 
well defined what do you mean by the most perfect being does this most perfect being hang around does 
talk to us is it more perfect to talk to us than not talk to us is the most 
being a male or female or is it genderless is it more perfect to be genderless or to be 
or female is the most perfect being blue or is it colorless what is most perfect we actually defined 
of these words which is why we think we can conceive of it but conception might actually be different 
think that you can conceive of the most perfect being i think a sensible concept therefore even if you 
the fact that conceiving of it would necessarily imply its existence i think quite get there anyway just a 
to the people yeah really smart people who take the stuff very seriously and are convinced by our arguments 
the principle of sufficient reason etcetera that we need more than just a selfcontained description of the universe and 
might be right but my personal landing place here is that the universe can just be it can just 
a brute fact so with that in mind we still have a little bit to do because even though 
answer to the question if the answer is why is there something rather than nothing on bertrand side i 
the answer is it just is you got to live with it you might still ask even if you 
agreed with me on that one why this particular universe why does the universe exist in this way rather 
in some other way and often what the actual discourse back and forth about why the universe exist comes 
to people are arguing about why does it have this number of dimensions these particles and so forth again 
is a question why this particular universe that may or may not have an answer a little skeptical about 
certain way of thinking that many of the best physicists have when they ask themselves the laws of physics 
been einstein himself is way smarter than i ever will be einstein wondered about this the laws of physics 
been anything because i think the answer is perfectly obvious namely the laws of physics could have been very 
very have no trouble conceiving of all sorts of different ways the laws of physics could have not even 
if sensible to say the laws of physics could not have been otherwise thinking of it in terms of 
as we talked about before equation says is a certain special thing what we what physics is called the 
of the which is the answer to the question given some universe how much energy does it have what 
the universe go from picture and all sorts of different hamiltonians we could imagine all sorts of different ways 
can imagine assigning different amounts of energy to stuff in the universe so i even see what the possible 
would be for arguing that the laws of physics as we know them are somehow unique i think really 
starter in this argument you could imagine that if the laws of physics were unique that would be of 
way to explaining why the universe exists there was only one way for it to exist right so maybe 
least of the way either gonna exist or not and the other chance but i think that the universe 
have been very very different than what we observed so not sure where that really comes from it is 
that even if the laws of physics could have been different there is nevertheless something special about the particular 
that we have i mean maybe the laws that underlie the universe at the most fundamental level are somehow 
simplest they could be or the most elegant or beautiful or something like that now again they look very 
or elegant from our current point of view nice things about them that are simple and elegant but you 
all these particles the top quark who ordered that what is that doing there not very clear on why 
particles have all the different masses and couplings they do seems to be a lot of arbitrariness in the 
of physics as we know them but maybe just our view of a very messy reality that has even 
laws that we know about which are very simple and give rise to the messiness and apparent arbitrariness that 
observe very very possible i think that really all we can say there is an open question right maybe 
find super fundamental laws of physics that are even if not the only laws of physics possible or conceivable 
simplest or the best in some way yet to be defined note that would not explain the question after 
if our laws of physics our universe was the simplest or most elegant or beautiful the little kid our 
here could come along and say why why should the laws of physics be so simple why is and 
have an answer that would just have to be a brute fact i also get away without at least 
the idea that the local laws of physics that we local i mean our entire observable universe tens of 
of light years across those laws of physics might be due to what is called environmental selection we tend 
think that the laws that we observe in the universe are universal by construction but possible since we only 
part of the universe that the conditions are very very different elsewhere and if true if conditions could be 
very different elsewhere in the unobservable universe maybe the conditions out there just give rise to intelligent creatures such 
ourselves this is of course the anthropic principle but really just environmental selection the same principle that says here 
the solar system there is not some deep existential puzzle about why life arose on earth rather than on 
sun or in between the planets there is an environment here on earth that was just way more hospitable 
life coming into existence maybe the universe is like that and if true we would not be at all 
to find ourselves in the part of the universe where life can be allowed to exist that sort of 
tautologous that if there are many different conditions in the universe some of which support life and some of 
we will see those that support life what is not tautologous is whether not the universe is actually like 
we know whether there are different parts of the universe where conditions are very different elsewhere we also know 
robust life is i mean this is the really big puzzle and this is maybe food for thought for 
different episode of the podcast how finely tuned are the laws of physics and conditions in our local universe 
the existence of life some people think very finely tuned i tend to be more skeptical more openminded about 
because i know the conditions under which life could exist a wonderful novel called egg by robert forward where 
described life existing on the surface of a neutron star if you think of life in very general term 
sort of a complex system interacting in an informationally dense way with this environment that could happen under a 
bunch of conditions that i really know anything about or maybe not maybe the necessary laws of physics are 
delicate for something like that to happen i think this is another open question where we should be humble 
what we know we know the final answers here alright speaking of final answers so the round up the 
points again as james hartle likes to say are the options for the real not the question of why 
in the universe or why the laws of physics are this way rather than that way why does the 
exist at all why is there something why is there reality rather than not reality so let me run 
very quickly i think five sensible things you could put forward and give you my judgments you can give 
own judgments start your own podcast have a little debate about it good why here so the most obvious 
is god right this was answer why is there something rather than nothing because a thing that need a 
the universe is contingent it does need a reason something that a necessary creature god that fits the role 
the principle of sufficient reason laid out for it i told you why i think especially necessary still the 
of is it a good theory does god explain does it provide an adequate helpful account of things that 
observe around us that is again a topic for a different day maybe be a future podcast episode but 
particular answer is no i think especially helpful i think especially necessary opinions differ about that one a second 
is what you might call a metaverse so kind of like a multiverse but even bigger and i discussed 
in any detail but the point is if the difficulty in providing reason why answers is that no context 
of which the universe comes right when you provide a reason why the pizza arrived at your door you 
so within a context of things like hunger and pizzas and phones and internets and things like that and 
for the universe no outside context no bigger picture out of which you can say here are the local 
why so a metaverse would be a bigger picture maybe a multiverse but maybe even bigger than that so 
a collection of many many multiverses and you could say why how a particular universe came to be in 
the same way you would say why the pizza showed up at your i talk about this in any 
i see zero evidence that either true or necessary or helpful but a logical possibility to put on the 
third so number one was god number two was metaverse number three is that there is some principle that 
universe satisfies right that the universe is the simplest best most elegant prettiest i know i think that solves 
problem i think that number one i see any reason that true and number two still the little kid 
why why should we be the best universe in any particular it would provide some satisfaction to us if 
were true right it would scratch the explanatory itch if you really explain why we lived in the best 
possible or most elegant at least knowing that we did would give us some feeling that accomplish something okay 
this kind of that kind of makes sense it really answer the question but it provides some of the 
goal that we were trying to strive for when we asked the question in the first place again i 
it i think there but we could find it absolutely possible in the future the fourth option which i 
mention at all in this rather long disquisition but i think interesting and should be talked about more is 
possibility that there an option for the universe not to exist in other words we talked about the existence 
a necessary being and god and so forth but another way that you could sort of slice this bread 
could say well maybe there is simply no coherent notion of not existing maybe nonexistence make sense in some 
not sure how to develop this idea not sure if right not trying to promote it not saying i 
it but i think that at least it deserves thinking about and the reason why i think it deserves 
about is when you read very brilliant people talking about this question they often use a vocabulary that quite 
that quite make sense derek parfit who is one of the great contemporary philosophers who died just last year 
he wrote about this question of why there is something rather than nothing very famously and he uses phrases 
case where nothing would have how we talk right i mean what if there were nothingness but you see 
doing in a phrase like that nothing would have been or what if there were nothingness attaching being to 
nothing is what was or what would have been not sure that makes sense i think that the thing 
exists being nonexistence is a sensible thing to talk about i think that maybe our language is fooling us 
maybe we are fooling ourselves through our language i know but i think that philosophers should pay attention to 
possibility a little bit more carefully and finally fifth on our list is the universe just is you wanna 
why the universe is not gonna get a satisfactory answer not gonna be happy the universe just is you 
to accept it you have to learn to deal with it nothing further there i like this i mean 
like it sort of you know in terms of again scratching explanatory itches but i think the one that 
most courageous most brave it faces up to the reality of it all of these other attempts hit this 
kid problem of saying if true why is that true why is that true why is that and here 
nope there is one level at which you just say how it is there is nothing other than that 
is what bertrand russell was trying to say i think this is probably the right answer and i know 
people like it but whether we like it or not is not part of how we should judge a 
of why the universe is the way it is so maybe the universe is special in conclusion maybe something 
about it that going to find or on the trail of also maybe it just is i think we 
to be at least open to that possibility we get to whatever the right answer is we get to 
that the answer take a certain form because it makes us happy that is not what allowed to do 
scientists as philosophers as theologians as thinkers we have to look at what the universe is doing try to 
it and understanding the best we can and if the answer is the universe is a brute fact then 
we have to learn to deal with and with that in mind i hope that tonight when you go 
sleep not too worried about the nonexistence of the universe and you can sleep well thanks music the question 
wrong there is nothing but and this we talk about the evidence that exists even empty space is teeming 
virtual particles the question should be why do we think there is when no evidence it exists i see 
of evidence of existence is every where we but this you speak of the evidence that exists outside of 
concept beautifully explained fascinating topic why is a question arising from emergence the human mind while the universe existed 
humans arose it just makes sense to say existence is exists probability of quantum states of energy fields thank 
i agree with sean where he says that nothingness was not an option because by what mechanism could that 
be selected if there was a mechanism to select existence or nothingness then existence has already happened so the 
that there is something right here and now means that existence is inevitable existence is also inexplicable because for 
to have an ultimate explanation would imply that there is a potent actor beyond everything that is which is 
illogical but if you run with that infinite regression you can only draw the same conclusion that no ultimate 
no ultimate explanation on a side note i think the uneasiness commonly felt towards many worlds is the modern 
delusion we have no more reason to believe that this is the only universe than the romans had for 
this is the only planet i think it makes sense to say could exist as implied in the question 
there something rather than but if you ask the question then rule out what you are left with is 
necessarily i say because there was no other option this comment has to do with format rather than content 
believe that sean needed an interviewer i frequently stop by edgeorg and its main shortcoming is that it is 
monotonous solo voice i am writing with regard to pitch timbre and rhythm not content although the content may 
enhanced by something that the interviewer hears and reacts to that sean may have overlooked i have three suggestions 
ouellette because she probably has lots of experience asking you questions ira flatow the host of science friday because 
has lots of experience asking many people questions having to do with science alan alda because of his voice 
knowledge of science and his desire to make it more widely consumed as demonstrated by what he does with 
flame challenge great episode and overview of the topic which i find fascinating agree with the comments on the 
above does it make sense that nothing cannot exist in a material sense but can in an abstract mathematical 
and in what sense then does math reflect the workings of the world as it does on some obvious 
although not necessarily directly related liked sean to touch on some of the more outre slightly disreputable consciousnessfirst metaphysicsmodels 
the universe that some have advanced granted i know this is probably a materialist crowd but would like take 
that he mentions it briefly in big but does not entertain it at all sean sir van morrison arrives 
the same conclusion as you on summertime in england it why it just is so after all the science 
answer is a very zen buddhist new age tree hugging guru humping crystal gazing esoteric just is chief when 
investigate negative incidents such as accidents to get to the root cause a favorite simple approach was the advice 
ask why five times why did the incident occur well because this action happened prior to the incident and 
caused the incident then you ask why did this activity occur and its because a prior action occurred and 
on the number five was just to encourage people to keep asking and not be satisfied with stopping at 
first casual action so then the next question was well if you start asking why when does it make 
to stop the answer is when dealing with the action to make sure it does not reoccur if the 
is outside your control then you have gone to far the idea is simply that their is no value 
saying that the fundamental cause of the incident is such that we cannot effect a solution in fact we 
joke that you could go all the way back to the beginning and say that the reason the accident 
was the big bang this might be true but is off little value in ensuring that the accident does 
reoccur so my thought is could we apply this same line of reasoning to the question of why did 
occur rather than nothing in this case if we have gone so far that we cannot hope to test 
idea in the near future have we gone to far i know this is one of physicists current concerns 
string theory why is the universe this answer seems equivalent to the god answer great podcast read the paper 
while ago following the blog on the subject and now the audio version george i think the two situations 
different for the universe we start by stating that the universe exists based on the evidence and the question 
why does it exist we are not questioning the existence of the universe for a god we start with 
does a god exist this is where we are until we can answer this question the question of why 
god exists seems premature we might ask if a god were to exist why does this god exist but 
this point we have no specifics as to the nature of this god which means there are infinite possibilities 
option mentioned granted it is an extension of options two and the metaverse and the universe following some principle 
carroll mentioned environmental selection this extends into one other theory universal natural selection using sean pizza example it is 
to use a natural selection based answer as much as it is to use a biological function or physical 
reason why is the pizza delivery person at our door one could answer that we evolved from small to 
sized quadrupeds meaning something like annelids earth worms or cnidarians jellyfish or would have extreme difficulty coming up the 
much less being able to ring the door bell or carry a pizza richard natural selection answer just your 
your grandmother your great grandmother etc etc had to have lived long enough to reproduce every ancestor going back 
bacteria every single celled eukaryote every deuterostome aquatic life form every fish every amphibian every synapsid reptile every mammal 
is directly tied your lineage had to survive long enough to reproduce this is a good answer however there 
one answer that goes even further just as sean answer to everything is big bang initial taking sean annoying 
who asks do animals or single celled eukaryotes or bacteria want to survive and the ultimate answer to that 
that rna dna and genes to replicate this is the ultimate answer to why do birds have feathers why 
fish have gills why do monkeys climb trees all the way up to and including why is the pizza 
person at my door but of course annoying child intervenes again and asks does rna and dna want to 
of our current knowledge we have an answer to that question the universe may be similar there are entirely 
nonintentional answers to some biological questions why is pollen light and fluffy the answer which had no intention behind 
other than genes wanting to replicate is being light and fluffy helps ensure it will stick to behinds better 
are also biological questions that do have intent behind them why are dachshunds aka wiener dogs shaped the way 
are the answer has genes want to replicate included as well as having intent behind it if a german 
golden retriever any domestic dog that closely resembles a wolf goes down a hole their paws are in front 
them and if a ferret or badger is in the hole they have short legs and their teeth their 
are directly in front of them and they can simply bite the dogs paws a dachshund that was intentionally 
to have short legs so that its teeth its weapon is directly in front in order to go down 
and flush out animals i am not saying we have evidence but you cannot exclude the possibility that our 
exists or has the initial conditions it has due to a combination of purely natural selection and intentional selection 
for this theory to be correct there must be a multiverse or a metaverse as sean carroll described if 
are ever able to definitively conclude that there is only one universe there has ever only been one universe 
that one universe is ours then this combination theory would be proven incorrect and would no longer be an 
as of our current knowledge we cannot discount a multiverse which means that this combination theory still has to 
included as an option it may be difficult to almost impossible for a universe to alter its own constants 
its own starting conditions in true natural selection variation is a requirement and variation would also be a requirement 
this combination theory and it may be difficult to almost impossible for a universe on its own to create 
a universe that has the correct starting conditions to eventually sustain lifeforms could also in time along with these 
create a species intelligent enough to be able to alter the constants or possibly even starting conditions life on 
planet may have started as something simpler than even bacteria and it is likely that this very first life 
much variation in time because nothing is perfect this life would have started to accumulate more and more variation 
as we see today no life exists that does not have variation within its genetic code assuming that the 
exists universes may have come about without much variation but if a universe happened to come about that could 
life and this life evolved and lived long enough to be able to alter the constants in the universe 
time the majority of universes would be universes that are capable of sustaining life it may i am not 
there is any evidence but it may be the case that our universe came into existence due to its 
universe what i mean by that is that it is possible that our previous universe had a big bang 
sustained life and had lifeforms capable of altering the constants within their universe it may also be the case 
this universe would go on expanding forever these lifeforms at some point would ask the question it best to 
our universe to keep expanding until there are no stars planets life or even atoms or is it better 
use our knowledge change the physics of this universe so that instead of expanding it contracts into a singularity 
eventually causes another big bang and thus spawning another new i believe the answer to this is quite simple 
is possible that these individuals also knew how to partially or entirely give our universe its starting conditions what 
occur if and i stress if this occurred is that universes that sustain life and could eventually change the 
within their universe would begin to outnumber universes that cannot sustain life or maybe could sustain life but not 
enough for it to evolve into an intelligent species it maybe the case that the answer to sean annoying 
does rna and dna want to would be because the universe itself to replicate which in turn would become 
new ultimate reason for everything including the big band and its starting conditions now of course this next question 
be does the universe to there may just not ever be an answer to that question love your podcast 
you sean you are a naturalborn professor clear deep honest more solo episodes please aliens did it not a 
or quantum physicist not even particularly good at math however if i could kind of sum up what you 
is that the universe in a sense is itself an emergent property of itself if time is an emergent 
then space and gravity would follow that that said i hate to be the little kid but then emergent 
what a question that may contradict or support the idea that the universe just is depending on different points 
view of course not being an expert at all my summation could be completely off however if not be 
to know your thoughts on my little kid question great podcast how about one on david hume a recent 
article and your reccommendation sparked my interest and it would be very interesting to get a better idea of 
own views err simulations all the way down option four probably has a big overlap with option for the 
to make sense there have to be two possibilities nonexistence on the one hand and existence on the other 
for individual things this seems totally intuitive take yourself totally concievable that you yet come into existence this was 
case two hundred years ago for instance and you existing right now obviously makes the other option very concievable 
how does this concievability question plays out with reality as a whole for option to be right one has 
argue that for the total of reality completely other rules apply than for parts of it being a brute 
could be one of those other properties another hint for option to be the right way to think about 
problem is the observation in every day life when discussing philosophical problems that one of the most occurring logical 
is the false dichotomy fallacy at least in my experience and option would argue for the question to be 
a fallacy i guess one more thing when talking about the anthropic principle one usually means the so called 
version of it because the strong version seems preposterous but not all that convinced when you take metaphysics this 
seems like a strong version of the antropic principle and the copenhagen interpretation of qm seems to hint in 
direction how could one frase the position maybe something like an epistemic version of the strong antropic principle in 
without any epistemic apparatus the way kant meant it there are no distinctions made what so ever including the 
in time one is talking about in that case there being noone to observe there is nothing distinct one 
into circular causation problems of course and a stretch but philosophers have thought out systems in that direction for 
worth it is worth looking at the idea of reasons from the point of view of philosophers hugo mercier 
dan sperber the enigma of reason we all just assume that actions are explained by reasons we ask someone 
the pizza has arrived and we expect that there will be some reason and the kinds of reasons that 
gives are typical they are rational however this is not really how people make decisions or produce reasons most 
our decisions are unconscious we act first then we come up with reasons post hoc to justify our actions 
many studies backup this order of things we can generalise by saying that reasons are post hoc rationalisations for 
they are seldom rational in the classical sense indeed reason in the classical sense exist we can say that 
are how humans account for their own behaviour the argument against teleology would then be that reasons apply outside 
human social domain in particular the universe simply evolves in patterned ways that correspond to the motivations of human 
motivation reasons for acting is a feature of sentience we can sensibly ask a person why they did something 
expect an answer even if the answer we get is a post hoc rationalisation we cannot ask a planet 
it orbits the sun for a reason to be satisfying it has to fit our expectation of the type 
reason why is there pizza i was we can check that against how we would reason and it seems 
that is an acceptable answer but if you know that i just ate a meal find my reason of 
reasons are all about experience if we ask the planet why it orbits the sun we expect an answer 
this kind we can say that it does and how it does but it do so for a reason 
we understand the term however for most of human history we have understood the universe in terms of ourselves 
see agency everywhere cf justin barrett and his theory of the hyperactive agency detection device in this prescientific line 
reasoning complex things that happen must have agency behind them agents are sentient therefore the agent has a reason 
their behaviour so things like weather is a result of agency in this view the universe itself has agency 
it exists then it must have been motivated to come into existence or some other agent must have willed 
into being asking why there is something rather than nothing is meaningful question in this framework its just that 
framework is illogical in fact agency is something confined to sentient animals outside of this domain there is not 
things happen for reasons they do happen so asking for reasons outside the domain of sentience is a badly 
question it assumed axioms that we know to be false once we sort out the frame of reference or 
domain of enquiry we see that asking for reasons for things like why the universe exists is simply a 
error because the conditioning to see agency goes deep we expect their to be reasons and with people we 
infer reasons for acting by observing them other minds are like our minds if fact we are not very 
at this but we are convinced that we are this is called the fundamental attribution fallacy in any case 
believe that we can infer reasons for behaviour by observation if the universe exists for a reasons then we 
need to pay attention to how the universe behaves and the reason will become obvious just as we believe 
a recidivist criminal who talk to the police can be understood by observation again what we do is introspect 
what kinds of things might make us behave that way and assume this is what applies it works ok 
we are from similar backgrounds in similar cultures and have similar life experience but precision is strongly limited by 
the teleological everything happens for a an unstandable belief however it is rooted in logical fallacy and cognitive bias 
summarise reasons only apply to sentient beings they are posthoc rationalisations of decisions and behaviour reasons are acceptable if 
resonate with our reasons for acting or our introspections of what might make us behave a certain way reasons 
the behaviour of nonsentient objects there are no reasons for nonsentient behaviour there are explanations of how things unfold 
since there is no agency behind the behaviour there can be no reason for it asking for reasons outside 
the domain of sentience is like trying to get blood from a stone extremely interesting and no i like 
it just is but it is probably the most likely answer carl sagan once said universe is not required 
be in perfect harmony with human it appears equally true with human inquisitiveness as to whether or not we 
accept the answer that it just is of course we perhaps the answer be approached through thought and is 
only to the feeling principle ie we have to experience it perhaps not for now going with the kid
