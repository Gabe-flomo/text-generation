hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll all of us are faced with difficult 
in our lives big decisions we know whether to do something or not because the ramifications of doing it 
not might just be enormous right getting married going to graduate school getting a new job moving across the 
other sort of lifechanging decisions but we generally think that even though it might be difficult to make these 
the underlying strategy of being rational is not that hard to understand we have preferences right we might like 
new things but we might not like working really hard so something in favor of going to graduate school 
something against going to graduate school sc so the problem imagine that you are considering a kind of life 
that will literally change who you are the kind of choice that is so big that the person after 
choice is made is a different person than you are now before the choice is made these are called 
experiences and guest laurie paul is the expert a philosopher at yale university written about transformative experiences and she 
raised the following issue you might just say okay gonna make some big change become a different person but 
can just look at other people done that other people gone to grad school or have gotten married or 
i will ask them how they feel about the problem is that how your response is after made the 
might not be relevant to your preferences now because you are a different person and you might not know 
made the change you might not be able to remember what it was like to be you sc the 
example that she uses is becoming a vampire right i mean you can ask vampires how do they like 
and say we love being but the things that they like about it might not be things that are 
to your preferences right now so how do we adapt rationality to the case of transformative experiences when ourselves 
over time and of course once you open up this box you have very interesting things to ask about 
it means to change over time what it means to have a personal identity even though you as a 
are not the same person now that you were five years ago or will be five years from now 
i think we find the onceandforall answers here but a really fascinating conversation about a set of issues that 
all face without kind of even knowing it sc so thanks for supporting the mindscape podcast remember we have 
webpage at preposterousuniversecompodcast and something i always mean to remind people of but always forget is a mailing list 
probably the podcast just pops up into your podcast listener device whatever that might be but if you want 
can get an email every time a new episode comes out a mailchimp mailing service but go to the 
you can click on the mailing both a regular mailing list for episodes and in principle another mailing list 
announcements never been an announcement but you never know it could happen thanks for being part of the mindscape 
and with that go music sc laurie paul welcome to the mindscape podcast laurie paul hi sean nice to 
here sc so gonna be talking about transformative experiences i think this is a unusualchallenging topic a little bit 
unlike quantum mechanics where no one thinks they know going on this is something where there are some challenging 
that people should think about but they probably all think they know what the right answer is right away 
have you encountered that in talking about this lp right yeah and one place because the phrase has a 
of ordinary interpretation and what i wanna talk about completely different from that deeply related to that but has 
important nuances yeah often there i have to have a discussion back and forth where people think they might 
about it and i think they do kind of know about it but maybe a little more to it 
there are some details that gonna get into right what philosophers do right so maybe to ease the path 
why you just give us the punchline why you just give us the elevator pitch for what talking about 
then we can back up and get there in a more detailed way lp okay so the way that 
wanna think about transformative experiences are as lifechanging experiences which is the sort of more ordinary way of thinking 
them but i think we have to be more specific than that because there are lots of lifechanging experiences 
have that kind of surprise us in certain ways or necessarily teach us new things in the ways that 
in the concept of transformative experience that especially interested in applies to a set of very specific big life 
and often they are changes that we face when at crossroads and one way i like to think about 
is in terms of decisionmaking so frame it in terms of decisionmaking here but not just about making decisions 
if you had the chance like a onetimeonly chance say to become a parent or my favorite example is 
become a vampire sc yeah definitely gonna talk about the vampire thing yeah chuckle lp okay alright alright so 
about i tell you about vampires my favorite case sc sure lp okay so dracula comes to you touring 
castle somewhere in europe and he says i like the way you carry yourself i wanna make you one 
and you find this kind of stunning and exciting and a little frightening and so he says a little 
more he says look be able to have amazing new powers and look amazing in black and be in 
of my legions and be for all important ways be relatively i mean okay barring stakes through the heart 
such chuckle sc stay away from the van helsings chuckle lp yeah sunlight and so this is incredibly exciting 
okay so an amazing opportunity you rush back to your airbnb and you call your mom and your mom 
interesting well already a and you say this why you tell so okay so after things calm down you 
asking her questions about what like and what she thinks you should do because worried because you know that 
go out in the sun sc some downsides yeah lp yeah and they drink blood and kinda gross and 
have no soul or whatever right and she tries to tell you about it and she says you and 
tries to tell you why she thinks it would be a great thing for you to do you really 
get the detail you need she just says really amazing really and then she finally says after talked for 
bit look just something that you as a human possibly understand you have to have the experience yourself to 
out humans really understand what like to be a vampire a vampire okay and so okay you trust your 
and you check around and you text some friends and you find out in fact that actually everybody you 
has become a vampire and pretty chuckle lp you have the same conversation with everyone else about should i 
it what are the pros and and they say there are some pros and there are some cons but 
really care about the cons and fabulous and you should do it okay so this onetimeonly chance to have 
amazing experience that you in some ways know and in very important ways know what like unless you undergo 
now the transformative experience a kind of experience that you know about until you actually undergo it and clearly 
a vampire is life changing and so a lifechanging experience it changes in a very deep and fundamental sense 
you are now i framed it in terms of having an opportunity to do this so there was a 
and i find that very helpful because the idea of a transformative experience some of them kind of come 
us unbidden sc sure lp and we can talk about that but sometimes we have a choice about whether 
undergo one sc the vampire thing is clearly a very thinly veiled metaphor for having kids chuckle lp yes 
maybe yes exactly because well up all night and chuckle drained laughter sc drink the blood of the innocent 
know lp exactly exactly exactly right so i use it in other discussions as a kind of thought experiment 
outline the conceptual structure of a reallife kind of case where you had this maybe not a onetimeonly chance 
become a parent because maybe you could become a parent more than once but your first time say and 
you are facing this new kind of experience that you have to actually undergo you have to actually have 
child and form that lifechanging kind of parental loving attachment bond with the particular child that you produced to 
know what gonna be like to live your life with that child as the parent of that child sc 
lp and of course i think life changing when you do form that bond so the structure and then 
we think about it in terms of decisions actually a special problem that arises so super interested in transformative 
straightforwardly i think they punctuate our lives in various kinds of ways and so i think of it as 
if you were just like if you drew a line there would be these large jumps whenever you had 
transformative experience like think if your world line where gonna see lots of variation in general and already interesting 
if we think about decisionmaking where we have a picture of rational decisionmaking involving being able to kind of 
ahead of time what sort of act performing and what sorts of outcomes deciding between and in particular knowing 
about those outcomes to sort of mentally simulate the possibilities and assign them values and on that basis choose 
most preferred option then the cases that i just described create serious problems for us as individuals making those 
because we evaluate all the options that we need to in fact some of the most important options we 
them in the way that we want to sc right lp which means we assess the tradeoff sc we 
who gonna be something like that lp yeah two things one is we know the nature of the outcome 
so that means this way in which you reason through it involving a kind of firstpersonal modeling molly crockett 
psychologist at yale has done really important work on modelbased reasoning and modelfree reasoning and a lot of times 
we reason for new things we use modelbased reasoning and i think of that in this case as like 
myself say being a parent or being a vampire or just enjoying the new wing of a house considering 
right these are just things that we do sc are there degrees of these transformative experiences lp yeah i 
easy cases for myself like really radical transformations where this kind of epistemic shift in virtue of having the 
experience so profound that it scales up on to a personal thing sc vampires want different things than nonvampires 
yeah yeah they think that blood is incredibly tasty and has different flavors presumably and i mean one can 
the moral question by having it be artificial or something like that but still pretty gross sc right okay 
where gonna go gonna try to figure out what it means to make choices to rationally deliberate in the 
of these transformative experiences so put something on the table that everyone can just agree with like what is 
ordinary way of thinking about making rational decisions right the decision theory or whatever the calculus is be a 
explain to the folks out there how to make rational decisions lp okay right so gonna go i mean 
are lots of different models and so what trying to do is pick and in some sense the most 
generic way of thinking about this so say trying to figure out which pair of socks to wear one 
you get up and you look and you have three different pairs of socks you like all of them 
pair is red one pair is blue and one pair has i know black and white polka dots right 
have interesting socks and so you set all three pairs of socks out on your dresser and you observe 
and you have to think about well which pair of socks would you like to wear and various kinds 
properties are gonna matter for example what color is your outfit will anyone see your socks i think always 
chuckle sc you can get away with more if no one is gonna see them lp yeah exactly exactly 
can know on the inside that wearing polka dots but if going to the airport and gonna be taking 
your shoes maybe you might well it depends maybe you want to just draw attention to yourself sc depends 
who you are lp yeah exactly exactly so you look at the three pairs of socks and you assign 
to each like maybe wear the red ones maybe wear the blue ones or maybe wear the polka dot 
each and you can make a choice you can choose the red ones you can chose the blue ones 
can chose the polka dot ones and each choice you make has a certain value right and also just 
not adding in there can be like how likely is it that actually be able to wear those socks 
all in front of you so okay sc a hundred percent chance when you decide yeah lp yeah exactly 
it simple you could feed in issues about well when thinking about being able to wear the red socks 
could an elf show up immediately and steal them right ready to try to take them and how likely 
that and pack that in there sc well some things do have probabilities involved right i mean you play 
lottery but okay lp exactly exactly but simplifying it sc gonna ignore that lp yeah yeah because in this 
easy is that you know the value of each choice of each outcome and so what you wanna do 
is in a very simple sense you wanna choose the option going to give you the most value that 
want the most gonna maximize your expected value very simply the way so the rational thing to do is 
choose the pair of socks that you like most it would seem weird if you really liked the red 
and you chose the polka dot socks instead like making some kind of mistake there laughter sc right right 
so maximizing something that been calling it value we could also call it utility or something like that right 
yes sc the so and you can generalize it to situations where a chance of different things happening and 
expected value is there okay so the ordinary rational way of making decisions now is this completely unproblematic even 
we get to transformative experiences i think i mean let me just ask you this way is every decisionmaking 
modelable in terms of maximizing some value or utility lp no i mean totally problematic in all kinds of 
chuckle chuckle sc okay good lp so not like and a huge amount of debate about whether we well 
people act rationally in all kinds of context sc also true lp this model has all kinds of issues 
it i mean we mentioning issues about the probability of various outcomes happening all kinds of crazy things like 
about the radical possibility that i know that a mysterious new pair of amazing sparkly socks could appear just 
soon as all kinds or whatever so there are lots of complications with the model but the work that 
doing connecting with decision theory is intended to bring in a sense a new kind of complication and a 
that is a little less bizarre than some of the straightforward ones that are worried about like sort of 
small probabilities of crazy things happening that can kinda mess up your decision not what talking about sc i 
what i have in mind is that i guess a semifamous example where you try to buy a house 
you put in a bid and someone else puts in a bid just a little bit more and you 
it you just quite afford it and i think that the sort of rational utility maximizing would say you 
sad about that if you had paid more money that would be worse but you are sad about it 
get the so somehow like a tiny change in what happens leads to a huge change in how you 
about it so is that a flaw in the rational decision theory kind of stuff or is that just 
flaw in human beings and how they think about the world lp a good question i think it depends 
how we tell the story so if the case that there was some change that then so you got 
information and that adjusted your preferences in some way then you what happens is that you have to do 
you did a reassessment and then you would maximize your utility by spending more and getting the house well 
rational to have wanted to do that if instead there really is no change in your preferences but some 
kind of psychological bias some kind of regret or other kinds of things happening then not rational to like 
to be sad not rational to be sad that you get the house sc but are we defining rationality 
be that chuckle or is it just a true feature of rationality lp well okay so there are subtle 
here i think okay two issues one is that we wanna distinguish between what you might think of as 
kinda normative or kind of objective standard of rationality and then what agents do in particular situations given human 
and kind of trying to do the best they can in various circumstances the kind of more subjective sense 
being rational and we can come back to that but also the case that a lot of things that 
into decisionmaking and so what i was trying to work with was a very simple idea that choosing rationally 
maximizing utility or maximizing your expected utility and that as long as doing that then doing something that in 
sense approaches like rational action and rational choice sc yeah like you said trying to raise a new problem 
that which is tell me what it is in this language now yeah lp okay actually let me give 
a quick definition first and tell you this okay so when i was talking about these experiences like becoming 
vampire or becoming a parent for the first time i described them as epistemically transformative in my work and 
i mean by that is that they change how you think in a certain way they give you new 
they teach you something new in virtue of having these experiences sc right but not just new information a 
way of thinking induced by that new information lp yeah exactly well i mean the way complicated psychologically so 
virtue of having this new kind of experience i think if especially if an intense experience it does change 
you think now you can try a new kind of food and it might just give you new information 
give you new abilities to imagine food like that but it change or restructure i think how you think 
yourself sc exactly right lp but when it scales up into also a personally transformative experience again like becoming 
vampire or becoming a parent then the radical discovery epistemic discovery that you make also then affects you in 
very strong way thus changing the way that you understand yourself or how you think and your preferences okay 
once we have that in play and remember really important is that you have to have the experience so 
like someone can tell you in the relevant sense what the experience is gonna be like and not good 
sc the super crucial thing right lp the yeah sc like you just ask somebody else what like lp 
exactly sc well a vampire and gonna say just get it man just not a lp exactly exactly i 
they can say great and all these but not enough i have another example to try to bring that 
in a second so the thought is just going back to the rationality question if something that this dramatic 
that i know about beforehand then a way in which i assign it value the first part of the 
experience issue relevant for their decisionmaking i then assign value to the outcome but the other part really important 
because of this new information is so important to you or it affects you psychologically so much it changes 
you think and that changes your preferences sc right lp so this kind of a onetwo punch that you 
when you have a transformative experience sc drinking blood is gross to me now but it would be awesome 
me once i were a vampire lp exactly exactly sc how do i judge lp exactly and because you 
yourself or model yourself forward as a vampire a way in which you see who gonna become from the 
and part of what i find so fascinating about these cases so a different kind of objection from the 
of worries about just kind of getting a model gonna fit the situation in the right way given like 
there could be these other or sometimes we psychologically we have these biases or regret or things like that 
are all important questions but adding this one to the mix and i also think something that people face 
real life all the time and it kind of goes unnoticed and relates to how we praise people and 
people and things like that so i wanted to talk about it sc well and the other aspect that 
crucially important here maybe this is jumping ahead but okay a podcast chuckle sc not only rationality but the 
that is it my preferences now that matter or my preferences in the future because what does that say 
the notion of preferences in the lp exactly sc i could be a different person and how do i 
myself over time lp exactly sc for those of us who care about the manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics 
is already an important question so for those of us who care about just one world making hard decisions 
a another important question lp oh interesting we should talk sometime about how this might fit into the manyworlds 
cool okay so no this is exactly right so a way and this is related this is part of 
worry for decisionmaking because this issue about selfchange like i am now ex right thinking about what i care 
and how i want my life to go sc you have to define for the nonlatin speakers in the 
chuckle lp oh sorry sorry sorry chuckle who i am now before undergone any changes as making the choice 
i try to think about what it would be like to be a vampire and imagine just like the 
of this life that considering and the problem is is that if i choose to become a vampire it 
change not just my species become a vampire instead of a human but also change how i think so 
violation of called actstate independence normally when think about when trying to test something ordinarily and you wanna see 
i do this i will see this and so you tweak one thing and you see if a tweak 
the line right and then if there is then established a certain kind of dependence if you tweaked especially 
then there have been that other tweak and then you can make certain kinds of inferences about that but 
assumes that nothing crazy is gonna change in between sc yeah lp but in this case this case of 
a transformative choice exactly a case where choosing an outcome but you are gonna get tweaked right as you 
sc inevitable that the tweak happens yeah lp exactly exactly so the agent is changed in virtue of making 
choice and so then unclear first what we can infer from the fact that down the line the new 
is satisfied with the choice because would that old agent have been satisfied with the choice and this matters 
a rational decision model perspective because the person making the choice is the one supposed to be acting rationally 
they had to make the right choice for themselves ex ante so but really what doing is making maybe 
right choice for themselves ex post after the decision sc right maybe we could just talk at a very 
level about what it means to be a self over time right the same atoms but not exactly some 
we lose some atoms we gain and we certainly are a slightly different person five minutes from now than 
are right now why does it even make sense to treat ourselves as a unified individual over time lp 
fair enough i think that there are lots of ways in which people change i distinguish between the selves 
realize a person over time and being the same person although ordinary language make that distinction sc yeah lp 
it just gets ambiguous with ordinary language but we do change i get my hair cut you buy new 
whatever but the way thinking about the self here is primarily in terms of firstperson experience of themselves and 
nature of their life and i think this is something obviously very important to us especially important in western 
one might say where we have a lot of choice over our lives and we take a lot of 
responsibility based on these choices so another thing important here is interested in cases where sort of morally open 
you to do different things so no moral or legal obligation to choose one way or the other and 
take in many cases like the choice to become a parent to be like that sc yeah usually not 
chuckle lp yeah yeah exactly i mean there are moral arguments but setting some of that aside for the 
so these kinds of choices that are kind of selforiented or selfinvolved in the sense that making a choice 
you and your life and a choice that can affect close others though like for example if you choose 
bring a child into the world well then that affects the child sc other people are affected by it 
yeah exactly i mean the other parent is affected and so the thought is that a natural sense in 
we think of ourselves from the inside as this kind of i know consciousness moving forward in time somehow 
we want it to be relatively continuous we recognize there are changes but we want it to be relatively 
and i also think of what we care about how we value things as an important part of what 
take to be kind of who we are and we want that to be continuous or at least if 
gonna make it continuous that we know what doing when changing it sc yeah yeah so this opens i 
maybe the vampire example is already good enough but we can think of other examples like taking some kind 
happy pills they make you happy certainly we see other people who take them and perfectly happy but they 
have bad consequences nominally like people become indolent and they stop exercising and they eventually die within a few 
right lp right sc but if you asked any of them they would say yeah this is great the 
pills are and so it would seem that from our present perspective not taking the pills we wanna do 
even though they all say a good idea is that a good example lp that is a really good 
interested in cases where from the outside it seems to pretty much everyone that this person have made the 
that they made but they are actually once made the choice and before they made the choice would have 
it but then somehow they find themselves in that new situation maybe they have an accident or they make 
choice under certain kinds of circumstances and happy with it and super interested in how we judge that and 
we think about that and whether it really is the wrong choice i think an open question can i 
you go back to my parenting example sc yes please lp okay so one case really interested in is 
say somebody want to have a child because say she has the opportunity she has the modes means and 
chuckle sc yeah chuckle lp mode means and opportunity right sc usually for murders but sure we can do 
for having kids too chuckle laughter lp all part of the context here she just wanna do it but 
parents are like be so happy as a mother really make you feel like a complete yada yada yada 
whole story and she says earlier she was talking about being a vampire with her mom now talking about 
a kid right sc yeah lp see the parents on the playground with the kids they look exhausted every 
i know just complains about how they get any sleep and about how stressful it is how the child 
crying or cranky and worried about money and having career issues i mean why would i wanna do sc 
lp and the mom says yeah yeah i understand that making sacrifices but once you become a parent sc 
it lp joy love yeah exactly this is exactly the kind of change of self that interested in because 
that your mother is right the descriptive facts on the sc if wrong then easy lp yeah exactly exactly 
easy no problem but the interesting case is when right and a version of the happy pill sc yeah 
but the happy pill there are kinda cultural reasons why people might wanna choose against that so why i 
the parenting case is i think a really open question where people have the right to not become parents 
have good lives that way people have the right to become parents and have good lives that way so 
simple sc and i think that probably the obvious response to the question about transformative experience for a lot 
the audience for me certainly when i first started thinking about this is you just ask people you just 
of gather data from a thirdperson perspective and what saying is not quite enough i mean the happy certainly 
very obvious example of that you can ask them and perfectly happy but the parenting example is quite analogous 
quite much more realistic where it can be a difficult question lp right i mean if something about the 
of becoming transformed makes you value the end sc in a way that your present self lp in a 
that your present self utterly rejects in sc yeah lp then this needs to be factored in to the 
so one thing that been discussing with transformative experience is to say well maybe because of this violation of 
independence that i mentioned earlier then this possibility that a new preference is kind of implanted in you in 
of undergoing the experience and that just changes how we should evaluate testimony it changes how we should praise 
blame people for the choices that they make all kinds of things sc is again probably skipping ahead but 
there a simple answer to this chuckle is there a prescription offering chuckle lp i ask questions not good 
answers though chuckle i i make some suggestions in my book transformative experience where i say one way to 
this is to kind of be open to the way that your preferences and who you are is going 
change if you make a transformative choice and to see that as what doing like just discovering a new 
or choosing to discover a new self i know if sc so the process of changing has an intrinsic 
lp something like that i mean i still thinking about it and this was at the end of the 
basically developing all of the structure of the transformative experience put a puzzle in terms of decisionmaking it seemed 
me that there is a way you can rationally approach these things and that is being open to these 
and discovering who become maybe because intrinsically valuable to have those experiences not even sure we have to say 
but i do i am oriented that way but i think satisfying as a final solution so i really 
what to say laughter laughter sc well you put it in a language at one point about trying to 
empathetic with your future self right lp yes sc i mean trying to imagine what it would be like 
do wanna dig in a little bit to these questions of the self and also the phrase it would 
right this reminds us of on the podcast had previous discussions about consciousness had david chalmers and philip goff 
daniel dennett in different ways talking about qualia and inner experience and the famous mary the color scientist argument 
know experiencing the redness of red is there a secret or not so secret relationship between those kind of 
perspective arguments and what talking about here lp a relationship but what i did with my work was to 
those discussions about consciousness and tweak them pretty significantly those debates are about whether or not we can kind 
make sense or explain from a kind of physical or neural perspective what like or what like to have 
and not really not making that kind of argument or not really sc not arguing about physicalism versus panpsychism 
anything like that right yeah lp absolutely not no no exactly interested if you take the mary case where 
grows up in a black and white environment and then i think of it as well maybe she has 
choice to leave her black and white room and the question is well does she wanna live in a 
of color but not interested in like at the end of all science just say ordinary in some sense 
mary now we have all the brain science to even know what her brain states will be like she 
testimony from people who live outside but she could find it overwhelming and stressful and a way in which 
assign value to these different color experiences she just know she even have technically the right kind of phenomenal 
to consider and so she make the decision in a suitably informed way she has to kind of flip 
coin or just do it if she wants to find out what like like saying but like the same 
maybe to becoming a parent or becoming a vampire so a connection there one of the way i kind 
put it is i think of the problem not about consciousness per se but the problem of other minds 
knowing what other people are like from the inside and when undergoing these radical selfchanges we turn that problem 
a problem of knowing the minds of of your other selves sc right lp the same problem an intraself 
sc your possible future self not even your simple actual future self but you have sort lp all the 
ones sc different alternatives to go down lp yes yes sc which reminds me not sure if this is 
or not but i did have a fascinating podcast interview with malcolm maciver who is thinking about the evolution 
consciousness over time and he makes the claim that a crucial step probably many steps along the way but 
crucial step was when fish climbed on to land because when fish are under water you see very far 
of you and all the evolutionary pressure is just to make decisions right away when you have a new 
come into your sensorium whereas when on land you can see far and now you have enough time to 
different possible actions lp oh interesting sc so and actually made predictions that have come true in the fossil 
and things like that and the idea is that suddenly the ability to imagine alternative futures becomes a good 
and therefore evolution selects for it and this is kind of what challenging here the ability to accurately imagine 
futures lp fascinating but one thing really a big part of my work is to say that when talking 
lifechanging decisions and especially i just wanna go back to context where there are hard tradeoffs to be made 
kind of an academic woman with a career so a person very salient too because the world is not 
up in a way for me to make my sc you have choices lp yeah right exactly and different 
of people have faced different kinds of this in different ways but if not if the world kind of 
up so that the choices are really easy or there are no big tradeoffs or no time to deliberate 
that affects the way that thinking about things obviously but when we really do care about gonna happen over 
reasonably sort of long time future period and i think we think actually intrinsically valuable like it relates to 
way that we think about who we are and how we evaluate life and authentic living and choice making 
sounds like an interesting evolutionary connection which is fascinating chuckle sc yeah yeah lp when in that kind of 
is when these sorts of problems become especially salient sc is it valid in this context to even think 
ourselves even at one moment of time as a unified self you do talk a little bit about the 
that sometimes we know to do something is irrational but we just have an overwhelming compulsion to do it 
like i know in this household where doing this podcast there is a prescription against buying limedusted tortilla chips 
if a bag of limedusted tortilla chuckle sc gonna get eaten right away and bad for you and so 
buy them in the first place right lp yeah sc like i might know that a rational decision to 
made but i because real people are not quite that rational how does that come into these kinds of 
lp well i would oh by the way my weakness is new york super fudge chunk ben i just 
sc okay a very good weakness chuckle lp just helpless in the face of it so this goes back 
the distinction i was making between objective characterizations of rational decisionmaking and subjective ones a way in which part 
what super interested in is the stuff like what like for us as individuals faced with different possibilities to 
through our choices and then make a choice as rationally as we can in the moment and imperfect agents 
often in imperfect circumstances been lots of research on perfect agents what they should do in perfect circumstances and 
of like objective rationality and then lots of research on what the perfect agent should do in imperfect circumstances 
i think research on what imperfect agents should do in perfect circumstances chuckle lp but that last box of 
been filled in and really where targeting the project so i wanna grant that there are all these imperfections 
sometimes we just kinda help ourselves and do these kinds of things but not really thinking about those kinds 
that particular kind of psychological weakness the kind of imperfection that really interested in is one where just because 
had the background experiences we lack the ability to imagine what we need sc yeah lp one favorite example 
have is of someone who grows up congenitally blind and then has the opportunity to through having a retina 
or something like that to become sighted they might know from actually from testimony from people had the operation 
they will regret that operation this is something that does happen and yet they might really want to do 
even though a really deep sense in which they know what gonna be like and maybe they wanna do 
because they wanna discover what like to see but they might also just be thinking i i know that 
nature of my life will be better somehow or i think it will be in any case a sense 
which an imperfect agent making a choice because choosing to have this new sense capacity and they have the 
to evaluate the nature of that sense capacity until they actually have it sc i do feel like there 
be even if we grant that when you change in some transformative way you have different values and you 
about different things maybe this is wrong but i wanted to think that something more objective going on i 
i think the happy pills are a hypothetical example but there are drug addicts right there are people who 
heroin addicts and most people who are not heroin addicts do not want to be heroin addicts but the 
who are heroin addicts really want that heroin right and so is there no standpoint outside of the firstperson 
where you could say one is just better than the lp right oh i do think i wanna dismiss 
all but the importance of testimony what we can know in general from science and also these basic these 
about kinda quality of life and wellbeing so with the heroin addiction case i think the hard case by 
way is at the endoflife cases where there other people depending on you and where not gonna kind of 
out on various kinds of resources and whether or not you wanna become a heroin addict there is a 
salient choice sc oh i see so you endoflife in terms of whether to end it but whether to 
a heroin addict before you do it lp oh sorry sorry no yeah if like by going into a 
or something like that because you have a terminal disease sc yeah lp but so i think that like 
the way that i wanna think about like say a drug addiction case is that we know objectively that 
of those options are bad and addiction is funny because there not clear that the choice involved that we 
enough kind of freedom mentally to be making the choice in the way that suggesting to make it where 
carefully evaluate each option and tradeoff sc that be an example of something that holding up objectively that a 
transformative experience that takes away our ability to make choices or something like that and we wanna do that 
yes yes a good point yes right right but then when somebody becomes addicted and lost in some sense 
ability to make certain kinds of choices and they also enjoy like the high and they want to leave 
space well i think actually we need to have more understanding of that i think a lot of blame 
gets attached to someone being in that state and also people understand why that person in that state like 
it valuable i mean they understand that it kind of feels good or whatever but a way in which 
understand and i actually think that this needs more assessment not like you know endorsing getting addicted to heroin 
i think that way too judgmental about these kinds of cases and fascinated with cases of disability partly because 
think that people who have like undergone traumatic accidents or who just have different kind of physical characteristics from 
kind of i know like bog standard ordinary human beings testify to how amazing their lives are in various 
and i think that people who share their physical characteristics fail to understand what talking about a kind of 
injustice involved here sc is there a strategy for doing better other than just talking to more people and 
to be empathetic lp well for me the first strategy is understanding this issue about transformative experience like not 
like i think a kind of epistemic humility that we need to engage in so by thinking i can 
everything i need to know about like what like to be a parent by talking to people i can 
everything i know about what like to be blind by talking to blind or whatever pick your category right 
think i think too optimistic sometimes that we can do that and this is related to the thing i 
about praise and blame because sometimes people choose to do things or refuse to do things thinking that with 
they have all of the information that they need i think they have some of the information they sc 
not that firstperson perspective lp no that firstperson perspective yeah sc and again just to emphasize it mentioning the 
perspective is something that is intrinsically different than the thirdperson perspective is not to mystify what it means to 
conscious or experience or anything like that lp exactly right sc a different thing like yeah mary has not 
the color red and so very happy to admit that she does not know what like to experience the 
red lp and all i need to get to go off and running then i mean you can see 
project as i love contemporary kind of academic philosophy but for the longest time the only way we were 
to talk about firstperson experience in phenomenology was in the context of the question about consciousness chuckle sc right 
good lp and a very important discussion and i always loved all the examples like nagel tom nagel and 
talking about like well maybe you know what like to be a bat or maybe you know what like 
be an octopus or mary in the black and i always thought they were super cool examples but like 
so much more interesting sc yeah and not gonna happen to me like not gonna be offered the opportunity 
become a bat but i will be offered the opportunity to change jobs or have a kid lp yes 
go to war maybe like all these kinds and endoflife questions i think are incredibly important like facing potential 
cognitive decline or dealing with an accident and i think we need to understand when we understand and then 
how we approach things sc is there some possibility for a new way of making judgments that is not 
purely based on testimony or firstperson perspective purely just babbling right now trying to be deductive though lp no 
no the only okay so the only kind of third way that i have come across that has some 
but i think good enough is thinking about the role of art and so there are ways in which 
try to i feel like sometimes the whole point of kind of work in art is to communicate something 
be expressed through ordinary testimony and description right and sometimes you use language in evocative ways and then you 
other media in evocative ways and important because it teaches us something about how to experience and value often 
like something that familiar with and then we can find the art really very powerful that way but sometimes 
not familiar with right sc right yeah lp and sc kind of art can be kind of an empathy 
right it can sort of help us empathize with people in very different circumstances lp exactly and to understand 
that that are kind of beyond our own individual experiences that said not enough i mean i can read 
of the novels i want about what like to be diagnosed with terminal cancer or watch amazing films about 
to war but if i go to like a vietnam vet and say yeah man i know i get 
i know what it was like to be they would just laugh at me chuckle sc i saw platoon 
lp yeah exactly exactly i mean that would be embarrassing but still the case that i did learn something 
complicated sc sure always interesting to me that almost every depiction on tv or movies of being the parent 
a young child makes it look horrible right laughter sc very few attempts to capture the joy of it 
or the value of it i mean maybe i know why but just more comedic or something lp well 
an extra thing that we talked about yet but i think this other dimension to it and related to 
stuff based on testimony which is sometimes we choose to do things that involve suffering and we find a 
of value in that suffering and not straightforward to explain why that is or why doing it so with 
happy sc sorry sometimes it is like you work out and some people like working out others are like 
slog but some future benefit that is lp exactly exactly sc but saying that even when not a clear 
benefit sometimes we do this lp right even if you think there a clear future benefit in a certain 
a way in which sometimes people choose to suffer and they choose to reduce their wellbeing along a certain 
and they find that meaningful and valuable and i think when sc why we mention some examples here lp 
actually what thinking well parenting is like that maybe okay or other kinds sc certain aspects of parenting chuckle 
lp yeah many aspects of parenting chuckle sc the am call yeah lp well i have two children many 
of chuckle chuckle lp are like that but you get a kind parenting does have lots of sort of 
joy with it but there are lots of choices we make so the happy pill was actually a kind 
a simple example say that if i had a tendency towards depression i sort of actually annoyingly cheerful chuckle 
lp but if i had a tendency towards getting depressed but i could take meds that would keep that 
bay in a very strong sense but it would change how i experience my life and in fact i 
think yeah be happier but just like a little bit less on top of things a little bit less 
and sophisticated and thoughtful a little less of right i might refuse i think this does happen to take 
meds and suffer and because a sense in which i find even though that suffering there i still find 
kinda more meaningful to live my life that way than the way that arguably is gonna increase my wellbeing 
most ordinary scales sc i think actually super common right people not just with depression but with bipolar disorders 
something like that they say these meds keep me level but they take away something of who i lp 
yes sc and part of what saying is not necessarily right or wrong but at least we should contemplate 
that claim seriously lp absolutely and this goes back to some of the stuff about disability so a blind 
who then becomes sighted can i think very reasonably feel first they lose certain capacities in virtue of gaining 
and they can feel or this comes up in the context of cochlear implants and people trying to decide 
or not their child should have a cochlear implant and become a member of a community with kind of 
language and ordinary audition or be a part of the deaf community all these issues come into play because 
a straightforward situation where a simple way of thinking about wellbeing sometimes you have to make these kinds of 
and a kind of meaningfulness associated maybe with say being a member of the deaf community or being a 
of the blind community that gives you a kind of richness and meaning that is not detectable to someone 
a part of that community sc probably another example is autistic people versus neurotypical people and different ways of 
lp yes yes yes yes absolutely absolutely sc is it really better or worse or is it just different 
do you know how could you possibly know lp absolutely and a thing to remember about the people who 
say someone like on the spectrum is i think a very good argument that the way that society is 
as opposed to how they are mentally structured that really creates many of the issues here and so when 
go back to what i was saying before that choices often hard choices are often hard because the world 
structured in a particular way and maybe you fit into that structure straightforwardly then all of a sudden then 
get faced with these special and difficult choices we have to make and again i just think that being 
clear about the conceptual structure of these problems and the epistemological hurdles we have to overcome and the selfchange 
will allow us to be less judgmental and more thoughtful about how we understand the different ways people have 
navigate the environment sc right and so you do have one example that is especially provocative and sure you 
it intentionally for this reason of atheistsskeptics and the possibility of them opening themselves to a sense of the 
and saying well let you say it lp okay sc how would you put it lp okay so this 
from my new book one i published yet that working on that should come out soon and there i 
sorry we should mention you have a book out lp oh yes sc an academic book the transformative experience 
does talk about these things if anyone in the audience wants to dive in lp yes yes but i 
about religious transformation and in my new book i apply what been saying about transformative experience not so much 
decisionmaking straightforwardly but just about transformative experience and how we think about it and understand it to questions about 
transformation and tolerance very interested in those kinds of cases and i think that describing all issues about skepticism 
belief here but a particular kind of debate that you see get carried out sometimes between like a believer 
a particular religious faith and a strong skeptic the atheist committed to sort of rejecting the idea that a 
and one of the things that fascinates me about the kind of debate that you sometimes see is that 
evidence seem to matter sc not relevant yeah lp yeah right an argument is not gonna convince people right 
right lp and the skeptic in particular this kind of skeptical stance where the skeptic thinks look the clear 
the one who looks at the sc i have no idea what talking about chuckle laughter lp the one 
really is careful and facing the hard facts of reality and the believer who needs or whatever right so 
see that point of view but suspicious of it as a kind of straightforward explanation of how all of 
and a good selfconsistent skeptic should themselves be skeptical of it suspicious of it lp yes yes yes exactly 
sc are we sure not fooling ourselves lp exactly exactly sc you should always be asking yourself that lp 
so what i explore in the book is a particular argument that that basically theologians and epistemologists have explored 
what i look at in particular is one that descends from the calvinist tradition because john calvin had this 
about the sensus divinitatis and this is about the sense of the divine and very roughly his view was 
we have this sense within us but it has to be awoken i believe he thought that it was 
of lost in the fall from grace right and there are ways that you can awaken this sense of 
divine including being kind of out in nature and seeing the beauty of nature and that can awaken our 
to recognize the divine in nature and other kinds of things and once we recognize the divine our capacity 
see the presence of god and to recognize evidence is awakened and naturally moved to belief the kind of 
advocate of this originally was jonathan edwards he was a protestant theologian sc not the presidential candidate lp no 
and actually a member of the jonathan edwards college at yale and it so i have a special connection 
chuckle lp that was kind of random but anyway sc you need to be a calvinist to be a 
member at that college lp no no no no sc okay lp no and alvin plantinga is a philosopher 
theologian who also advocated this and edwards talked about the sensus divinitatis and the idea was that you were 
to kind of engage in certain practices to awaken this sense right and you can find this by the 
in other traditions i think you can find it in judaism and expressed in different ways but the idea 
that practice and certain kinds of actions you perform can awaken and intensify your sense of the divine sc 
a clear analogy with a blind person choosing lp exactly sc regain their sight yeah lp what like to 
a rainbow or something like that or marry right right a kind what happens is you open your mind 
a certain way to having an experience that experience is novel and distinctive edwards talked about it as though 
you were tasting honey for the first time plantinga actually used the example of seeing red for the first 
sc he must have known what he was doing chuckle lp maybe i mean he i think so but 
sure sc a professional philosopher come on lp yeah he knew he chuckle lp well when i sure he 
brilliant sure that he knew that i mean he was intentionally harking back to the jackson example but i 
he was thinking in terms of transformative experience explicitly sc sure okay lp yeah i know how his work 
fascinating and what plantinga did so beautifully in his work was to explain that look you have to be 
to detect evidence before you can even see it as such so the thought is that the believer says 
need to open your mind in the right way to engage to awaken the sensus divinitatis and then you 
recognize the evidence of the divine and be moved to okay so go back to the skeptic right what 
in is the skeptic who refuses to make that move and i think a real question now why would 
skeptic refuse to make that move and i think now we can see now that we have the apparatus 
transformative experience like why they might do that because if sc sorry just get on the table that not 
divine persuasion or anything like that where both sides are accepting that we should be rational about the evidence 
yes right right sc just a matter of which evidence we have lp or what yeah what do i 
to be evidence or what is the evidence in some sense yes which evidence do we have and if 
believer says to the skeptic you have to open your mind first to the sensus divinitatis or to the 
thing so that your sensus divinitatis can then detect the right the skeptic might refuse to do that why 
they refuse to do that supposed to be openminded and looking at all the evidence and be super kind 
careful and clear and everything else and the thought is that well look if opening your mind to engage 
sensus divinitatis changes who you are and how you think the first part and something that you know about 
you open your mind because like tasting honey or seeing color for the first time then risking your very 
the first problem so asking someone to risk their very self to consider the possibility of this thing that 
right now believe in and second they lose a certain kind of control of something i think is deeply 
to them namely how they think or at least potentially from their ex ante perspective being asked to open 
mind up in a way that so that they can no longer in some sense control how they believe 
something to have and through having an experience that they actually assess the nature from within before they do 
sc and i think these worries seem to make sense whether or not you believe the sensus divinatis divinatis 
chuckle now i say it sc now ruined it lp chuckle move on chuckle sc okay move on whether 
or whether just selfdelusion right lp yes right sc either lp right sc once lp right sc once you 
god is talking to you or convinced yourself god is talking to you you are convinced potentially lp right 
no well the whole picture the argument is supposed to be that once you engage the sensus divinitatis that 
within you realize this is the way to live life now i see the evidence of the divine all 
and convinced and satisfied and happy from the outside it looks like a kind of mind control but from 
inside and these are rational thought for people who are believers not like taking a drug really not like 
a drug then but from the inside basically a believer is very happy and satisfied and committed to the 
that they understand the way the world is sc kind of like there are fitness landscapes to sets of 
right like in the big picture i called them of where you have different beliefs that sort of fit 
in a nice way and there could be more than one such planets that are completely compatible by your 
with your experience of the world but incompatible with each other lp which brings us to kuhn and and 
new theories of the nature of reality right so i think a really strong parallel here to the kind 
radical theoretical change that can happen in scientific communities and the kind of radical belief change that an individual 
undergo and just as somebody totally committed say to the newtonian world view or the like an aristotelian perspective 
the nature of the external world is just not going to be able to make sense of say i 
a contemporary picture of reality in terms of say quantum mechanics sc right lp just totally insane from the 
point of view sc they hear the words yeah lp no exactly exactly and and we can understand that 
these very different ways of making sense of the external world well i feel like the switch between the 
and the skeptic is like that partly about thinking in a very radical way about how the external world 
be different but also talking about an internal revolution as well like how you make sense of who you 
and how you think about the external world is also changing so even more radical than the ordinary kind 
scientific conceptual revolution sc also an obvious analogy with politics right i did a recent podcast with ezra klein 
political polarization and not about political disagreement disagreement has always been there but there has been a rise in 
decades in polarization in the sense that different political beliefs line up lp yes sc right and then once 
that world you even see what the other world sees anymore lp i think that a direct relationship here 
one of my yale colleagues does sc the sensus trumpinatus chuckle lp the laughter okay pretty good chuckle sc 
sorry for bringing us down sorry for lowering the tone there chuckle lp so i think exactly right i 
that this complex thing again this is not like a universal diagnosis but in certain kinds of cases where 
differences the thought is like i really think myself into someone politically completely opposed to me because if i 
empathize with that perspective if i fully empathize with that perspective then would that experience of stepping into their 
and thinking about how they live their life change the way that i think about things and in ways 
i right now so i might have a particular political view about what and be very committed to it 
about say how women should be treated in a certain context or transgender individuals and then if i really 
into this other perspective and kind of take on their values what if the experience of seeing the world 
their eyes restructured my own internal preferences sc who you are yeah lp and that would change who i 
in a very important way because we define ourselves partly by our political beliefs and other kinds of things 
that makes it rational in a certain way for me who i am not to wanna still be who 
am so a rational way in which i step into the mind of that other person to the extent 
i can because it might change me but terrible right chuckle lp that just means that not supposed to 
openminded somehow and i guess what saying not setting up a prescription here but i think we have to 
that there really is this barrier and what can drive i think either a commitment like to the right 
to the left and a refusal to really really wanna see the perspective of the other side is a 
way in which we need to protect our own identities and so then not about the evidence sc and 
even irrational like by the lights of who you are being rational lp no exactly my point right an 
argument for this kind of refusal to be openminded i think that we need to find some other way 
it sc disconcerting lp disconcerting but important to recognize that happening i think people fail to see and it 
not even be rational i mean rational in a certain way but i think a very we grasp the 
but at a very deep impulsive level sc i i think there is an imbalance you do say at 
end of a very long discussion that of course all this is true also for the point of view 
the believer contemplating becoming a skeptic lp yes absolutely yes yes yeah yeah yes yes sc a symmetry that 
but there is a little bit of an asymmetry because by the selfproclaimed lights of the skeptic they do 
you they could be argued into thinking they have a duty to experience this other way of looking at 
world because their whole selfimage is about gathering all the data and making a good decision but if the 
thought that putting themselves in the cognitive space of a skeptic would cause them to lose their faith they 
think i just wanna do that i know so there is a little bit of an asymmetry there lp 
i see i see no a good point have to think about that some more because i think there 
be other asymmetries on the other side but not super moved by the skeptical argument because i think a 
very basic way kind of instinct for selfpreservation gonna trump even your kind of highminded commitment to evaluating different 
sc as a practical matter sure sure lp yeah well and and interested here like in a certain kind 
practical way because the believer has that highflown argument as well like if you truly believe in the divine 
a kind of commitment to seeking divine truth i think that they they might even say truly committed then 
should be able to go out and risk viewing the skeptical point of view and be able to come 
then not sure even sc well maybe a different way of saying it just that some kind of epistemic 
to being the perfect skeptic who says i should experience everything and know all the different and there are 
like you experience all the different viewpoints chuckle lp yes no i think that is part of that is 
much part of what i wanna say and again just bringing it back to the practical i feel like 
is kind of epistemic humility question and we need to be clear about these constraints that we face we 
a eye point of view we take a eye point of view and see i think sometimes until analytic 
one intellectuals we think of ourselves as being able to take a eye an objective point of view sc 
yeah chuckle lp yeah and i sc physicists certainly do lp yes and well us philosophers as well and 
mean like not that i think that a mistake and sometimes this energy if you think about these things 
because kind of or something or limited somehow like you know what epistemically limited as human beings but not 
intelligence about our capacities to know things that we experienced just the way the brain sc yeah yeah and 
seem to make a great effort of not being too judgy or prescriptive here right lp yeah sc and 
part of that is just strategic like you want to emphasize that there is a difficulty that people even 
do you have secret chuckle prescriptions for overcoming these difficulties lp no no i mean a lot of my 
actually in some ways is very personal even though i try to kind of be very abstract and i 
a self you lp a sc interests and rationale lp and i try actually very hard to be empathetic 
lots of different perspectives and i do a lot of mentoring and teaching for lots of different reasons often 
in that role it actually especially one that i even want but i just end up doing it i 
important and with respect so for example very committed a very prochoice person but i have always always been 
in a certain way to the arguments against abortion because i have two children i love them dearly i 
do think that a frightening argument involved about ending the viability of a fetus that i think should be 
seriously but i fully know how to take it seriously given my prochoice commitments so just speaking very personally 
and so there are other reasons why people might be kind of prolife and that sort of thing but 
think there is a really compelling argument at the heart of those discussions and not sure able to give 
a fair shake and i think that important to recognize that sc yeah i think this is a good 
it takes me to the last time i went to talk about the question of authenticity and even if 
have a prescription for how to be perfectly rational in these possibilities of transformative experiences there are questions of 
how should we live our lives right kind of a question we have to answer what do we do 
even if i admit that this lacuna in my possible knowledge i still gotta act in some way is 
some sense in which being true to ourselves is the basis for acting or is this also undermining that 
ourselves can change in these interesting ways lp i think the way to be what we have to be 
to is maybe not ourselves but to our epistemic limitations so what we have to recognize is that as 
live our lives we change in these radical ways and we replace or we have the chance to replace 
current self with new selves sometimes we do that sometimes we get to choose it just happens and part 
what living life involves and that we should care about the nature of lived experience for ourselves and others 
not pretend that it matter i think also part of and recognize sometimes when trading off like wellbeing another 
but making choices to suffer and this is for me like philosophy is sometimes about truth but more about 
and so this is the way that i think we can connect some of these questions about rational decisionmaking 
consciousness and the metaphysics of selves and persons to authenticity and and living our life in a way as 
or informed as we can and kind of also understand a ton of uncertainty here sc yeah i mean 
it relates very clearly in my mind to questions of how to be moral if a naturalist and antirealist 
i am right i can say sentences and i can and do believe them of the form we have 
inclinations they come from a bunch of places from evolution from how raised and from our rational reflection and 
if not objectively grounded out there in the world we can use them to construct a moral code for 
but there is a foundational problem where did they come from if i were a very different person if 
had different genes or different upbringings maybe my morality would be different that bad that scary and now saying 
can become a different person because something that happens to me now becoming scarier and scarier making my life 
laurie chuckle lp i know sorry my job a philosopher chuckle chuckle sc is there any sort of you 
the word wisdom which is a very good word to use are there words of wisdom i mean the 
talk about this right you talk about your relationship to existentialism they seem to find an answer in authenticity 
god tell us how to behave but being our most authentic selves is still the right way to behave 
you pulled that rug out from under them entirely lp yeah a little i hope so i mean my 
is that authenticity involves understanding what we can know about ourselves and our futures and understanding what we know 
ourselves and our futures and coming to terms with that a different take sc that humilityhonesty thing again lp 
sc yeah lp and then doing the best we can sc doing the best we can a good message 
always like to leave on an optimistic note so i think we can still do the best we can 
i think that we all agree that having a more informed understanding of what the best we can do 
is good right lp yes yes the whole point is that you get wisdom and tolerance and a better 
of assessing praise and blame if you know as much as you can about i think the structure of 
we what agents are capable of how the human brain works what we can expect from people and what 
expect from people sc alright something to chew on okay laurie paul thanks so much for being on this 
music so glad i found this thank you both for recording and sharing it with the world i think 
will help me a bit hi i ponder taking a drugs that may help me hurt me or even 
me i take or pain pills because of the fear that it will damage the brain i have i 
a life that been kind to my body brain and the biological software my brain runs on in pain 
a year i feel that i will never meet a person that will hear me out to understand me 
atheist in utah depressed around of the time but have to hide it or i get insulted mocked or 
by the few people that care about me to some degree i need help but i get it found 
one doctor that might be able to help me but she take the goverment insurance i have i work 
i get or find real help anyways life sucked for me and i can only do what i can 
die haa ha so much drama but real writing this asking for help of some kind i know how
