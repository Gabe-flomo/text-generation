podcast your host sean carroll for a long time people very naturally assumed that there was the mind the 
essence of what we were as people and where the thinking happened and then there was the body and 
mind talked to the body they part of the same thing they were two separate entities that could somehow 
famously of course the philosopher and scientist rene descartes really formalized this idea of mindbody dualism you can read 
little bit about that in my book big where i try to bring to the historical foreground the figure 
princess elisabeth of bohemia who criticized descartes for what we would now call the interaction problem how in the 
is this disembodied mind is supposed to be talking to our actual body of course with the progress of 
and our understanding of how neurons in the brain work we see increasingly the mind is just a reflection 
what the brain is doing sc these days most working neuroscientists are not dualists when it comes to the 
and the brain they study the brain to think about how the mind is working in fact you can 
farther than that if the brain is where thinking happens what about the rest of the body there are 
in the rest of the body in fact there are cells and organs and so forth that clearly influence 
on in the brain might it not be more appropriate to think of the whole body as doing cognition 
some sense the thesis of a movement in neuroscience called embodied cognition the idea that where we are thinking 
our whole bodies not just the little brain inside our skull even something called embedded cognition which if i 
it correctly goes and says actually the whole world where we start doing our thinking when writing on a 
that notepad should be counted as part of your cognitive apparatus just like your brain not so sure about 
but the embodied cognition at least makes a lot of sense sc so guest lisa azizzadeh is a psychologist 
neuroscientist at the university of southern california here in los angeles and she studies how exactly cognition happens in 
brain and in the body for example by putting people in functional mri machines giving them different tasks watching 
blood flows to different parts of the brain and lisa is an expert in mirror neurons these are the 
neurons a lot of evidence that there certainly a lot of evidence are there in monkeys but even human 
we have neurons in our brain that fire both when we do something and when we see somebody else 
the same thing they mirror in our brains what we see someone else doing and these mirror neurons the 
goes play a crucial role in not just cognition but empathy how we understand the motivations and the thoughts 
other people and maybe even in some neurological diseases this is cuttingedge stuff controversial not exactly sure happening but 
a lot about it in conversation talk about mirror neurons embodied cognition more generally and a little bit about 
neuroscience has to teach us about the process of human creativity so go music sc alright lisa azizzadeh welcome 
the mindscape podcast lisa azizzadeh thank you great to be here sc so talking about embodied cognition lot of 
that are near here like embedded cognition and things like that so get to all that just take a 
back and contextualize this so cognition is not exactly the same as thinking is that right la cognition is 
the same as thinking so no i would say cognition is larger and broader than thinking it encompasses also 
also subconscious processing and so forth sc and we have this intuitive way of thinking about how we think 
have the feeling that people are intuitive dualists rene descartes they think of their mind as something almost separate 
the body affected by it and your thing is going in the more or less the opposite direction and 
the mind more and more into the body is that right la right so the more we learn about 
the more we learn that the body is part of the brain so all the neurons are interacting with 
body all the time and so from your gut to the senses on your fingers to hearing and even 
eye is probably the most relevant so attached to the brain actually but all of this interacts with the 
so largely that really impossible to separate processing in the brain from processing in the body sc right and 
the philosophy behind embedded cognition and so where did this come from who started thinking this way la psychologists 
been thinking about this for a long time so chalmers sc david chalmers that is yes la yes right 
lakoff is a linguist who has been thinking about this also for a long time in terms of language 
so he talks about embodied metaphors how we speak with our metaphors of the body and actions sc so 
what does that mean la yeah things like grasping the situation handling the truth so these are all embodied 
of talking about very abstract things sc okay so as a linguist that makes sense trying to think about 
we use certain visual metaphor i guess embodied metaphors la embodied metaphors exactly and then the neuroscience behind it 
was the discovery of mirror neurons which i think talk about in a little bit but mirror neurons were 
to be neurons that are active both when i do something and just when i watch someone do something 
not doing anything at all but active in my motor cortex as if doing something so this kind of 
other actions and then this actually supported a lot of george work in linguistics where we found that when 
said words like grasping the situation or handling the truth you would find activity in the motor cortex sc 
and so this is more or less this is where you come in because my impression you should tell 
but my impression is that your scientific work involves poking inside brains and seeing going on when doing different 
la right sc how do you do that la so i actually physically poke in the brain sc oh 
bad la so we use mri and we use functional mri so we put people inside the mri scanner 
we have them do something while in there and we look at the activity in different parts of the 
sc so this mri is a gigantic thing in lab and so not strapped down maybe but lying down 
their head is in the big donut is that right la exactly right sc and there been some controversy 
how reliable fmri are do you la sure every scientific method has its problems and mri is a pretty 
scientific method so you capture an individual neuron really getting indirect measures of deoxygenated blood flow so the parts 
the brain that use the more oxygen are the ones that are working and what measuring sc and my 
is good at locating things in the brain is less good at time resolution or something la exactly right 
has a lag it give you precise timing and localization about you can get by by two cubic millimeters 
okay and a lot of neurons la a lot of neurons yeah sc right yeah okay la yeah sc 
so get back to the could you help me understand embedded cognition versus embodied versus situated also right these 
all things we could talk about la yeah they overlap largely embodied cognition is the idea that the way 
we think is inherently rooted in our body systems so if you are anxious or nervous actually activity from 
internal organs that your brain is processing sc okay sorry so literally because of your organs doing la exactly 
that feeling anxious la right sc not just because a certain neuron in your brain sent a little signal 
it a nearby neuron la no we know from the sympathetic and parasympathetics systems that you have this large 
with the body and the brain is constantly picking up information from the body and so just talk about 
nervous so if you feel like butterflies in your stomach and anxious actually because your internal organs are being 
by your sympathetic nervous system and then that information is going to the brain and being interpreted as being 
sc okay trying to understand you read a little bit about this i guess and i think still controversial 
whole thing this is science of the cutting edge we agree on everything yet so la a theory sc 
theory there are crimagins and enthusiasts and the whole bit so a trivial sense in which sure my body 
brain talk to each other la yeah sc but trying to be a little bit more dramatic than that 
that right la right the idea is if you had a brain outside of a body could it actually 
things the way we do and so if you believe in this theory of embodied cognition then you would 
no sc what would it be a brain in the vat experiment if you put a brain in a 
and poke electrical signals at it saying that would not be a humanlike cognition going on la no i 
so i think the way that we inherently think and the way we process information has to do with 
with the body and the brain in the vat be able to do it the same way sc we 
very clearly mimic the signals getting from a body la this is laughter sc oh yeah i know a 
scientist so playing fun philosophical games la right the question is could you make a computer program that could 
enough information in it that it could simulate a body i guess the answer is theoretically probably possible but 
a little bit farfetched sc it makes sense biologically i always say this when i have biologists or neuroscientists 
the podcast but we were not intelligently designed not a team designing the brain and a separate team designing 
body that had to work well together the whole thing grew up organically so in some sense why should 
end at the boundary of the brain the nervous system fills our whole body la exactly right exactly sc 
so how do we test the extent to which true how do we figure out la right a lot 
the experiments that we run look at parts of the brain that are thought to be purely sensory motor 
we see if those regions are involved in this higher cognitive processing sc okay so explain what sensory motor 
in this context and higher cognitive processing la okay parts of the brain that are involved in motor control 
the body do things and it was theoretically thought before that those regions really just only do that they 
much more than that maybe they have some sensory functions as well but not much more beyond that and 
and more we find that involved in social cognition understanding other intentions understanding their actions involved in linguistic processing 
actions okay so language something else that we thought was higher cognition and then they also might be involved 
things like empathic processing things that we thought were really like the highest level of cognition sc so yes 
higher levels of cognition thinking more abstract thought emotions things like that la exactly sc as opposed to the 
unconscious things that are going on right la right sc and i read in one of these wikipedia articles 
was looking at that it was a starting realization when we figured out that most of the computing power 
the brain is spent on our unconscious processes what we think of as automatic and the higher cognitive capacity 
a relatively tiny amount of our brain work la yes except that division between higher and lower is a 
one sc a fuzzy one yeah la a fuzzy one and so not sure really where you draw the 
also something really interesting coming out more and more now is the idea of predictive modeling have you heard 
this so the idea is that two types of processing what we call bottomup it goes from your sensory 
your eyes your nose your mouth your somatosensory to the brain and then topdown so things that we predict 
happen that we start to already process as if happening driven by the brain and goes back down to 
primary areas sc okay la okay and so it used to be that this comes actually from robotics what 
found in robotics was that if everything was bottomup be too slow okay so the robot would be way 
slow to do anything and so we started to do what we called forward modelling for robots and so 
there you start to have some kind of predictive model and the bottomup model also sees if it can 
it and then you do some more robust processing that way and it increases speed and so we realized 
brain probably also works like that but people pretty much thought it was about bottomup and topdown and now 
and more research is coming out saying that the percentages are much more toward the topdown than the bottomup 
so we process things with this kind of prediction of what we expect to see people are giving numbers 
sc alright so you can quantify this this i know what that means of what la yeah very difficult 
difficult to quantify but looking basically at information coming from sensory systems versus information going down from prefrontal cortex 
things like that sc and this is like the classic problem of how in the world can people catch 
baseball not doing calculus in our head obviously la exactly sc but somehow our brains are predicting things la 
sc and judging the reality that we measure any one time versus those predictions is that right la exactly 
sc and so saying that this is the paradigm for how we do everything in the world la it 
like it and a little surprising if actually something like but yeah most of the work seems to be 
that sc and i think this has something to do again i get philosophical about these things with our 
of the flow of time because so saying that and maybe we can get into the details here a 
bit because this is interesting but saying that we have models of both ourselves and the environment that we 
in the future then updating them all the time la exactly right sc i think that heard people claim 
is why we feel that moving through time because of this constant give and take la interesting i think 
this is also where the interaction of neuroscience with physics comes in sc absolutely yeah la which is super 
yeah sc what we call the present moment is actually a few milliseconds in the past it takes us 
la to process it sc to process everything right yeah so is it one map of our body that 
in our brain one little homunculus or different little parts doing different things la there is a lot of 
parts doing a lot of different things sc so for example la you have the motor areas you have 
somatosensory areas you have auditory processing regions even in the motor areas you have multiple multiple maps sc okay 
in somatosensory areas you have multiple maps for your internal organs you have several maps in different parts sc 
per organ or several maps of each organ la no so several maps of integrated information from the organs 
sc okay so getting information from our heart and our liver and our lungs and going to different parts 
the brain that are predicting different things is that what thinking about la yeah processing it and predicting it 
so forth sc and so you begin to see why embodied cognition would sound like a good idea because 
right right the more you study it you find that there really parts of the brain that get information 
the body sc right okay and you can see this happen in your fmris la yes sc or you 
see something happening la you can see indirect evidence we would call it yeah sc what is a very 
thing that you would ask someone to do when in that fmri la okay so the original studies in 
neurons were done in monkeys so put electrodes inside a specific motor neuron and they watch the monkey do 
and they see what happens when the monkey observes someone else make the same action what we do the 
of that in humans is we put them in the scanner and we have them perform an action like 
for a cup or a ball or something like that and then have them watch someone else do the 
action and then we can go further and have them think about the intentions of that person or think 
what that person might be feeling when doing that action sc something you do with a human you do 
a monkey that very easily la exactly right and then you could do facial expressions you can have them 
facial expressions and things like that sc and what learning is that evolution is very good at recycling using 
same part of the brain to do what we might think of as very different tasks la exactly right 
it makes sense that through evolution you first probably had action the brain had to do something and then 
perception and that basically took up the whole brain and as evolution progressed then you start to use these 
for cognition sc right mentioned mirror neurons a couple of times just admit that we should talk about what 
are so tell us what a mirror neuron is how many of them are is there a particular place 
the brain where we find them la yeah mirror neurons were discovered in monkeys they were discovered in monkey 
which is equivalent to the premotor cortex in humans and the inferior frontal gyrus as well and they were 
to be active using single cell electrodes that were inserted into this area of the monkey brain they found 
these neurons are active when the monkey does something as well as when the monkey sees someone making the 
action sc okay and this when are we talking about la sc oh that recently okay la yes and 
was by lab in parma italy sc and so the same again is it even possible to ask how 
neurons talking about here is it four neurons la no no no quite a lot and the same brain 
this brain region a mosaic so some mirror neurons there other kinds of neurons there and so forth sc 
eightyfive billion neurons in the brain so probably a whole bunch that are doing this la yes right sc 
it really but how specialized are neurons localized in different parts of the brain but are the actual neurons 
one part of the brain different than neurons in other parts of the brain la yes mirror neurons are 
motor neurons so really only in motor areas been found now in the parietal cortex as well as in 
premotor area and then find visual neurons in other parts and so forth sc right so we discovered them 
monkeys a little neuron that does the same thing if the doing something and sees someone else do it 
not allowed to cut open human being skulls and put electric signals in there so harder to test this 
human beings but it would make sense right la right the way that we do it is by using 
like fmri you could also use eeg tms transcranial magnetic stimulation has also been used so all these indirect 
sc and this is something that we think has to do with okay what is the point why do 
mirror neurons do this so fine i i pick up a cup some neurons fire i see you pick 
a cup the same neurons fire in my brain up with that la okay this is where the theory 
in right sc yes la okay a bunch of different theories one very basic one is that involved in 
other actions the most simple one and then theories of simulation that the way i understand you the way 
understand what doing the way i understand when you reach for a cup that means that probably thirsty is 
simulating i know that when i reach for a cup because thirsty and so if my motor regions are 
unconsciously what doing at every moment then i have an understanding of your experience sc so it helps me 
a theory of your mind if i can sort of simulate it la exactly sc so the simulation hypothesis 
everything is just a little simulation in my brain la exactly right right and doing this constantly not just 
person in front of you but a lot of people doing a lot of things so a lot to 
track of sc right and is so i keep going back and forth between this but we do an 
to learn that the neurons are mirroring and then we invent a theory that says this helps us understand 
brains so how do we test that theory la right different ways you just design clever experiments to try 
get at the difference between understanding intention versus understanding the context of a scene versus understanding reaching without actually 
up a cup and you could look at brain differences for mirror neurons or what you think are mirror 
for each of those scenarios and compare activity levels sc is there an example of a clever experiment you 
think of la yeah actually one of them comes from lab where actually doing this in the monkey and 
he has the monkey reach for an apple and then he has the monkey watch an experimenter reach for 
apple and then he has an occluded scenario where at the moment where the grasp to the apple is 
happen a screen put on that the monkey can no longer see if the apple was there or not 
so now just a grasp but no object that the monkey sees but the monkey saw previously that the 
was there so he has to infer right sc right la and so you find that the mirror neurons 
still active but if the apple was not there and the person grasped for it then the mirror neurons 
longer activate sc oh okay so you know the person is doing the same la same exact action sc 
it has a different la yes sc it not grasping for la yes sc these neurons fire la right 
so from this the rizzolatti group infers that the intention of the goal is very important for these neurons 
so actually processing intentions sc good yet another reminder that the way the neurons represent the world is not 
a picture of the world this is a complicated thing where meanings and la and goals right sc and 
and purposes la motivation right sc and stuff like that yeah does this teach us much about human psychology 
you think la sure i think that always trying to understand other intentions and trying to understand the underlying 
of their actions and so it could be that these neurons in humans are also involved in doing that 
so where empathy comes in for example la mmhmm sc so do you study empathy for this reason la 
do we also find that people who score high on trait empathy measures of empathy they actually show more 
in these mirror regions sc okay is it something to be said about people who show any activity in 
region la yes we find i also study individuals with autism and we actually show that they have less 
in these regions and some people with autism also have lower empathic processing and difficulty with social processing in 
is the key misfunction in autism you also find empathy is complicated different kinds of empathy psychologists generally divide 
into three components sympathy which is kind of mentalizing is what we would call it where thinking about actions 
intentions and feelings but in a very abstract way sc right okay so not identifying with you as a 
but getting this idea of what thinking la yeah the best example i can give of this is if 
a relationship and your partner is really upset with you and having a really hard time getting it laughter 
never happened to me but sure la but they explain it more and more and kind of like in 
abstract realm like i kinda understand why upset with sc intellectually la intellectually i would never respond that way 
but i sc called sympathy a la called sympathy right sc right that sounds like a weird use of 
word sympathy to me but okay la a very cognitive form of empathy and very abstract then we have 
which is sharing feelings here i feel exactly what you feel so if in pain i actually feel that 
myself sc literally feel it la yeah literally feel it sc okay la and then compassion and compassion is 
behavior where you actually wanna do something to help the person so not only do you feel but you 
compassion for them and you wanna do something to help them sc and in la you have this feeling 
warmth for the other person sc i would guess all three of these are separate right i have compassion 
if i la exactly exactly first of all there are three different networks in the brain sc oh okay 
we can map these out la mmhmm and then different disorders so someone for example psychopaths are very good 
this abstract sympathy but very bad with empathy they actually feel the other pain but very good at manipulating 
because they have this kind of mentalizing and sympathy where they can abstractly understand people and then people with 
tend to be just the opposite sc so sorry la so sc not good at sympathy la not good 
sympathy but okay with affect sharing sc oh okay interesting and very interesting the idea there are networks in 
brain that do these different functions are they quite discrete and obviously separate is there some fixed number gonna 
twenty years from now there are thirtyfive networks in the brain that do these different emotional or is it 
they blend into each other la you mean empathic processing or are we talking about embodied cognition sc just 
generally la embodied sc yeah la yeah okay we talked about mirror neurons but since the discovery of mirror 
a lot of different kinds of shared circuits we call them have been found for example in the somatosensory 
areas that are active when touched we find that also active when i watch you being touched we find 
also with disgust regions regions that are active when i feel disgusted when i see you experiencing disgust also 
sc i read that husbands have these reactions when their wives are pregnant they get fake pregnancies they get 
sickness la oh interesting i heard of that sc well so i say i heard of it i literally 
it on castle rock last night this tv show stephen kingbased tv show and honestly they were all about 
neurons the slightly crazy character was convinced that her mirror neurons were reaching out la funny sc touching other 
la they actually used that term sc oh yeah they did yeah la oh wow sc and so i 
that was in addendum that was not in the original stephen king stories but la funny sc for him 
was just psychic powers but now mirror neurons la oh wow laughter sc so maybe not true the pregnancy 
i learned i trust hulu originals as my source material for psychological insight but it makes sense right la 
sc it is part and adaptive understanding how other people are feeling things but we wanna go too far 
not the same as them la right you find actually for people in the medical world they activate these 
circuits for empathy affect sharing much less than other people sc i was gonna say and also maybe homicide 
right when all these dead people and they have to be clinical and cognitive about it they feel like 
god this is a terrible la right exactly and so for people who are lacking empathy you probably wanna 
on that but in the typical population what you probably wanna focus your time working on is compassion instead 
want people to be stuck feeling pain to the point that they do anything about it but you want 
instead to try to focus on compassion to actually do something sc are there generally therapeutic implications for the 
of discoveries you make la right now our work is focused on autism so trying to figure the difficulty 
autism is that so many different subtypes and so working on different subtypes of autism and trying to categorize 
so that we can focus interventions not just everyone with autism gets to do this one intervention but maybe 
you have this particular subtype this would help you more sc i know very complicated and controversial and i 
friends who have autistic kids and very emotional how would you just explain what autism is to someone who 
what it was la yeah autism is defined by a deficit in social interaction the social piece of it 
being able to think about other emotions and understand their intentions is probably the biggest disorder in autism and 
also repetitive actions that are made and also communication deficits sc so something like you know when other people 
upset or you know why upset or why happy la right sc you get those cues right la right 
right processing other social information sc and this goes back to the idea that one of the roles of 
mirror neurons is when we see somebody looking happy or looking sad or whatever something goes off in our 
that is related to what happens when happy and sad that helps us understand is that right la exactly 
kind of simulating other people from a neurological perspective sc right and i seem to recall that in the 
earliest days when mirror neurons were being talked about this connection with autism was made and people pushed back 
it and other people hyped it up and so what is the state of play right now la yeah 
we think is that autism is very heterogeneous and probably types of autism where mirror neurons are more involved 
other types and so actually looking at autism comorbid with dyspraxia dyspraxia is a disorder a developmental disorder of 
and a lot of kids with autism have it sc so less coordinated la right but particularly a motor 
and since a motor deficit we thought that maybe these kids with autism who have dyspraxia are more likely 
have this kind of broken mirror hypothesis if you will and the data do seem to support that and 
the idea is that maybe the reason some people find mirror neurons are less active in autism and other 
is that autism is so heterogeneous and not looking at the same group sc yeah so some day again 
the future realize really twelve different things going on and we lumped them all under the label of autism 
exactly sc and so pretty convinced that at least some of them have a heavy involvement la not to 
the only thing going on sc sure la right so we do find a lot of other brain regions 
are also different in these kids but that this might be one component sc okay and does that have 
therapeutic implications we learn something about where in the brain something is happening but not gonna go in there 
poke it with an electrode so what can we do la yeah complicated especially given that this is just 
one piece of the story but one kind of therapy that has been done with kids with autism with 
success is called imitation therapy where you teach kids with autism to imitate and by imitating not only working 
motor pathways that they need to but also trying to understand the social implications sc is it almost like 
their neurons to be mirror neurons la exactly yeah and this again needs to be further tested but the 
is that maybe this kind of therapy would be most effective with these kids who have the additional dyspraxia 
maybe not a common therapy to just throw on every kid with autism sc because the hypothesis is not 
they lack the mirror neurons but that the neurons in their brain just mirroring the right way is that 
la right that they might not be working the same way sc okay so that in some sense it 
hope in the sense that you can train them to do something that maybe automatic but you can teach 
la right right sc my understanding is a lot of autistic kids just at the crudest level train themselves 
recognize social cues and emotional things on faces just in a kind of rote way even if they feel 
themselves and this la exactly exactly so very abstract sc right so this is maybe a more visceral version 
that is that fair la exactly yeah the idea an embodied version if you will sc an embodied version 
very good and beyond autistic kids are there wider psychological implications la yes we did a bunch of studies 
stroke patients after stroke the main if you have a motor impairment following stroke the most common thing that 
do is physical therapy or occupational therapy but the problem is only so many hours a day you could 
that and people get tired a lot of work and insurance companies only pay for that for the first 
months and so one idea is if we know that watching other people activates your own motor system what 
creating these videos of therapeutic things that watching someone else do and you can think of it kind of 
homework you give it to a patient before they come into their pt or ot and the night before 
watching these over and over again and the brain is getting primed and the idea is that when they 
to do that the next day they should actually be better and so we do find some support for 
as well sc so when you have a stroke is since i know nothing about this is most of 
damage in your brain or is it throughout your body la no so stroke is specific to the brain 
specific to the brain la yeah yeah sc and is mostly physical damage to the neurons or is it 
sort of a rewiring la exactly yes yeah sc so in some la a lesion yeah sc a lesion 
the brain okay la yeah sc so occupational physical therapy stretching and trying new motor skills la right so 
that would rewire the brain sc but saying it is the brain after all so we can hope to 
to rewire the brain in more directly braincentered ways la well sc thinking la by thinking exactly right and 
we believe in this embodied cognition then other ways to activate these motor systems beyond just moving back to 
body sc right so do we try virtual reality la virtual reality could be very helpful a little more 
with people with stroke they can get dizzy and fall down and you sc right okay la right so 
wanna be careful when you do that but just having them watch these movies seems to be pretty effective 
sc okay very good and what about just people who seem that empathetic laughter what about people who have 
obvious physiological issue la you mean like a psychopath sc yeah or just couples therapy someone not sharing their 
as much as they would like la oh okay yeah so the most comprehensive study of this being done 
actually being done by tania lab and what she finds is she has people do mindful meditation and different 
of mindful meditation for a long term i know exactly the details of how long doing it for but 
has them either do sympathy compassion training mindful meditation something called lovingkindness mindful meditation or some kind of control 
sc right la and what she finds is that actually doing this kind of meditation increases structural changes in 
networks sc in the brain la in the brain sc you can see the brain wiring itself differently doing 
la yeah yes exactly and also functional changes and also behavioral changes as well sc interesting i think that 
get a little bit scared or overly impressed by the phrase rewiring the brain like this rewires the brain 
in fact everything we do at any moment in time is always rewiring our brain every memory we take 
every memory we remember is rewiring our brain la right true true right yeah so the interesting thing for 
is that she sees these in these like either the compassion network or the sympathy network or the empathy 
depending on which one focusing on in your meditation sc and i think said this already but still remarkable 
me so we can take an fmri and see a place light up and go the sympathy la mmhmm 
so again the empathy network the emotion resonance ones seems to be in these emotion regions mirror neuron regions 
so forth the sympathy regions tend to be prefrontal cortex temporoparietal junction and the precuneus sc it does become 
and harder to be a mindbody dualist when you see this part of the brain is responsible for this 
reaction right la right right so yeah so there are people who would argue and not sure wrong that 
is this embodied cognition but the sympathy network might be different than that sc i see la and it 
be more abstract sc right la complicated the prefrontal cortex also still gets a lot of information from the 
as do all these regions sc yeah la but yeah sc my default at this stage of scientific progress 
to think that we know anything about neuroscience at all we have some good ideas and some of them 
turn out to be right but we have no right to be confident in some ideas versus others like 
say way more complicated than physics is la way more complicated so actually just to embody this even more 
of the things that got some funding to do is to add a microbiotic component sc okay so explain 
that means la yeah so you have these bacteria in your gut and they actually interact with neurons in 
gut sc neurons in your gut la yes and with your different systems in the brain and different systems 
the body so your immune systems and so forth and those interact with the brain and so going back 
autism we know that a lot of kids with autism have stomach problems and it has been found that 
also have different microbiota than the typical population and given that we also know that the microbiota are now 
not directly indirectly with either visceral neurons in the stomach or through metabolites that can travel to the brain 
interact with the brain so these then the question is how does this all fit together so how going 
in your stomach with these bacteria interact with brain functioning and with behavior sc so saying when people claim 
they make decisions with their gut they might be literally doing that la exactly exactly sc scary and i 
some people like that i talked about this on a podcast with carl zimmer the microbiome we have all 
microbes living in approximately the same number of cells in the microbiome as there are human cells in our 
and that gets back i just keep wanting to go to these bigger philosophical questions embodied cognition and it 
of makes sense that our body is important so one of the things that is gonna be a challenge 
people try to construct artificial intelligences is that they have not just bodies but the motivations that the body 
us hunger and sleepiness and things like that are we learning about the prospects for artificial intelligence by studying 
cognition la i think just mainly understanding how complicated it would be to create a system and then especially 
you introduce the interaction of the body with these bacteria and so how is that influencing our cognition and 
we think and so forth sc yeah i think that there are books about uploading our brains right into 
matrix and just letting us live in the simulated reality so that will basically your point is just even 
than you think you have a body once up there la exactly and everything that goes with it sc 
and long thought that it just even if you could copy piece by piece all of your neurons and 
their connections into the computer it be a copy of you exactly because of these things because your inputs 
different and just gonna maybe be conscious maybe be intelligent but it have the motivation la be different sc 
different it be you and yeah somehow it count as immortality if you upload our brain that way right 
no unfortunately laughter sc but then also i forget what the word is but the idea extended cognition the 
that we use our environment around us as part of our cognitive capacities that goes beyond embodied cognition la 
that the context of the situation and the environment that in also is extremely important sc so if i 
notes to remember something i should count that notepad as part of my cognitive system is that right la 
right sc do you think this is a good idea laughter you have feelings about this la well that 
medium is larger than the right laughter sc never heard of it that way before yes right la so 
that sense yes i think definitely the environment and nonbiological systems are an important part of our cognitive processes 
i mean certainly as a physicist if standing at the blackboard writing some equations and solving them in some 
i can think of the blackboard and the chalk as part of my cognitive system just like my brain 
right sc but in some sense completely different so is quasiphilosophical or just become a scientific question where is 
useful place to draw the distinctions between these different things la right so actually these neurons where if you 
with a tool long enough that tool becomes embedded as part of your body representation sc okay because we 
these maps in our brain different parts of our body and so for example when people have prosthesis or 
just a cane that can be mapped on by our brain right la exactly and it actually even take 
long so in these monkey studies where using a rake to reach for a piece of food within a 
of minutes that rake becomes part of their body representation sc minutes la yeah sc so how do we 
that is that la actually by looking at single electrodes sc by single la so looking at the representation 
the reaching movement and then they start to see that it fills up to the periphery to just where 
rake goes sc and this helps also explain things like phantom limb syndrome la phantom limb is a little 
different so when you lose a body part but you feel like still there and we think that more 
to rewiring where if you look at the homunculus the body map in the brain in somatosensory regions for 
the face and the hand are very close together so now if lost a hand the face area takes 
the cortex that used to be logged to the hand and so now if you touch the face of 
person lost a hand they often feel it in their phantom hand sc oh i see okay la right 
because the cortex is not gonna leave that real estate alone gonna use it for something else and the 
was the closest thing so it took it over sc free cpu cycles as far as the brain is 
right la exactly right sc interesting and does that have implications when we do get into virtual reality our 
bodies like we can look different in virtual reality than we do in regular reality so if we have 
avatar does our i mean i guess it depends on the quality of the virtual reality experience but does 
avatar get a map of representation in the brain la oh an interesting question i know if actually looked 
that but i could imagine that it could happen yeah sc because usually we pick avatars that are better 
versions of ourselves right la right sc but we could imagine avatars to look completely different different numbers of 
and legs and i can imagine really good vr controllers that would let us control all those things separately 
right and thinking of like if you watch little kids playing video games and they make the avatar jump 
actually jumped themselves a little bit they do like a little hop so this kind of embodiment of the 
sc right that maked perfect sense and i know one of the other things worked on is related to 
how we relate to people different than us right la right right right sc part of it of course 
see people like us the same part of our brain reacting is when we react ourselves as people become 
and more different differences in age or ethnicity or gender or sickness or whatever does that make it harder 
empathize la yeah okay so if you think about this embodied cognition very easy to understand why you would 
embody and simulate people that you like and people you wanna be like and actually the chameleon effect in 
where been found over and over again that you implicitly imitate people who are similar to you and people 
wanna be like and people you admire so if having a conversation with you and you lean forward i 
forward if and this is all implicit not thinking about it sc called mirroring right la yeah also called 
chameleon effect sc okay la okay and then we do this less and less with people we wanna be 
right so if you like someone you tend to just have less of this chameleon effect so the question 
we wanted to ask in a bunch of our studies was how do you then process people who are 
different from you and perhaps the most dramatic difference that you can have is having a different body than 
else so we looked at a person who was born without arms and legs and we were curious how 
processes body parts that she have and how she understands them so if you take the theory of embodied 
seriously you use your body representations to understand other bodies but if you have those body representations then what 
you do sc right nothing for your neurons to mirror la right so we put her in the scanner 
we had her watch different kinds of actions some actions were possible for her even within different body parts 
for example picking up a pen she does with her mouth and some excuse me are completely impossible for 
so like going on tiptoe or using scissors she do that and basically what we found is that even 
things that she do she still tries to use her motor representations to understand other people but for things 
are impossible for her she additionally uses these sympathy regions sc oh okay so sort of offloading that task 
a different a part of the brain in some sense la exactly exactly so she tries to simulate it 
when that work she also uses the sympathy regions these mentalizing regions however she has like a lifetime of 
looking at people with full bodies right sc right la and so we also did the opposite we brought 
people watching her residual limb doing actions so for us a weird body part we often see that and 
we found is that when we get people more familiar with her they start to see it as if 
hand or a leg like a normal body part but in the beginning you see a lot of activity 
and so the idea is that with more exposure to people who are different from us then we start 
see them very similarly sc we normalize them in some sense la exactly and we embody them very similarly 
but a weird thing because i mean is i know i wanna say a worry but is it that 
treating them as they are fitting them into a box meant for us and really kind of different la 
so in the beginning what we see when not familiar with the person is a lot of activity in 
areas so using visual processing to understand this person but not this kind of more embodied processing and so 
idea is if we think that the embodied processing is important then we would want to have that be 
to watching other people and so the more familiar we get them with the person then the more of 
they have sc what about for animals can you do the same thing for just watching centipedes la yeah 
so an interesting study was when they when they had a human watch a monkey a dog or a 
make actions and they found that for all of those if you were watching the person or animal eat 
activated your mirror neurons sc okay common to everything la common we can do that but if it was 
like the human speaking versus the monkey making vocalizations versus the dog barking you would activate your mirror neurons 
for the first two but not for the dog barking sc not for the barking la yeah just so 
something we do sc but do you think we could train ourselves la yes laughter sc so crazy cat 
have systems in their brains that track them yelling and things like that la yes so i actually gave 
talk on this at disney animation and people were shocked they were like do you mean we know how 
do laughter and they started showing me how they can actually bark exactly like a dog so it was 
sc wow okay but experts trained in this la experts exactly sc right la but it probably still has 
limits so for example there is this theory about the snake i think heard about this sc i have 
la i think an interesting theory so the snake is the extreme other it moves in a way that 
can probably never replicate right sc right la and so probably we embody it the same way and so 
theory is that why in many cultures around the world the snake becomes either the deity or the devil 
or the devil i have not heard this la this extreme other sc okay so yeah powerful cosmic figures 
ones that map onto our representations of our body la the theory sc what the octopus the extreme other 
some sense la oh right sc it has a very different neural system than we do la yeah true 
less seen i mean how many times do you sc no true but have people thought of putting the 
in an fmri and laughter sorry la not that heard of but you do also have ursula sc sure 
right where also the kind of the mean sc put her eyes on her not a very realistic representation 
the other thing i remember is that also done work on creativity and human creativity and is this an 
of the work on embodied cognition or is it separate la no very separate actually sc okay lay it 
us what have you thought about creativity la okay so this work is basically looking at the interactions between 
left hemisphere and right hemisphere so probably heard that the right hemisphere is the emotional artistic hemisphere what a 
of people attribute to the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere just kind of sucks laughter your mathematical your 
sc i can use again la yeah sc not la but if someone asked you are you a right 
or left hemisphere person you would rather say you are right the cool hemisphere sc the cool hemisphere yes 
the nerdy hemisphere and the cool hemisphere yes la exactly right so so in popular culture the right hemisphere 
your creative brain however in the joe bogen had this theory that creativity comes not just from the right 
but an interaction between left hemisphere processing which is this more serial more localized more fast processing and so 
interaction between the left hemisphere with the right hemisphere which is this more visualspatial this more drawn out longterm 
just all the processing and that interaction of having both of those processing going on at the same time 
leads to creativity not just one versus the other sc okay that makes sense la so we did a 
of studies to test that and basically we supported that hypothesis sc how much does that help us understand 
ideas come from sure okay interaction between things is there something about that interaction that we can pinpoint la 
the more difficult question so we do know from a bunch of psychology studies that thinking about a problem 
different perspectives is really important thinking about a problem for a long time with a lot of focus and 
taking a break is really important right sc and can we attribute that to where our subconscious is still 
along at it la exactly and we know that the moment these kinds of creative moments come from a 
of subconscious processing so oftentimes when doing this noncreative processing know exactly where you are in the problem solving 
need five more minutes and then have the whereas with these creative moments someone will ask you how close 
you to the solution and say have no idea wait a second i got and so yeah a lot 
of this unconscious processing along with the conscious processing sc so do people from silicon valley come and ask 
advice on how to become more creative and things like that la we have some steps that i teach 
class and we do this workshop on creative ways to solve problems but no no one from silicon valley 
come sc not yet need a better agent probably alright so to sort of wrap things up think about 
broader picture here i have casually said neuroscience is still in a state where not really sure about anything 
the expert what do you think about our current understanding of how the brain works and how it connects 
the body overall and the prospects how long will it take before we really nail some of these things 
and what is most exciting things that we should be looking forward to in the future la yeah i 
what it means what you mean by nailing it down i think getting closer and closer to understanding enough 
be able to help people in different situations understanding enough to know what kinds of cognitive processing are useful 
helpful to society and the self versus ones that are probably not sc i mean pretty good la pretty 
right i think the goal for any neuroscientist is to have a comprehensive understanding of the brain i think 
long way off from that but i know if absolutely necessary to do all the other stuff that we 
to do to just help move society forward and to help people with problems get better sc there is 
human brain initiative and is that mostly concerned with mapping out the connections between the neurons la yes for 
most part it is which is not what we really do here sc would it even be helpful for 
to have such a map la without an understanding of the algorithm difficult to do much without it i 
knowing the algorithm is more important than the map sc heard people analogize it to like literally like having 
map of the city but not knowing why anyone is going down a road for one reason or another 
you understand the economic life of the city la sure good knowledge to have sc helpful la just like 
dna sequence is good to know right but not enough sc are there tools that are better than fmri 
are hopefully coming down the pike la yeah so mri has its limits so you move your head while 
the scanner sc okay a limit la so a huge limit loud and scary for some people if you 
any kind of metallic thing in your body you do it so is there anything better not yet sc 
do you think about braincomputer interfaces la yeah i mean i think great for people who have lost parts 
their body and who need some kind of prosthetic to do something for them i think amazing are you 
about robot soldiers and stuff sc no thinking about implants into our heads that will let us access our 
without a smartphone what i wanna have someday la you wanna have that sc i do la really sc 
think kind of inevitable so just planning for it la i think most people are hoping ways to unplug 
well i would hope be able to unplug yeah i guess maybe a downside like what if no off 
to it la right right right you are getting every single advertisement come at you sc i know that 
are companies now that will put a gear on your head a rig that will try to read some 
the activity in your brain very crude outside your skull a big layer in between and a long way 
trying to give the impression that i overhyped the idea of literally implanting something into your skull that sounds 
harder maybe never work la right okay but they they are starting to do that with people who have 
right sc i know la yeah yeah so it is being done and a very good reason to do 
for downloading email not sure a just so much bacteria you can get sc but this also the work 
doing in body cognition is that gonna be helpful to that kind of thing if you really at some 
someday try presumably if you have prosthetics you wanna make them more and more like parts of your body 
right and ideally have sensory signals that are going to your brain so you can embody that yeah so 
think that having that kind of system where you also are getting feedback from the prosthetic is also gonna 
very important sc it seems like gonna a physicist so i still like physics but a lot of exciting 
going on in neuroscience la yeah for sure sc the year by year changes are quite impressive la yeah 
would agree and kind of nice because i think as a physicist also feeling this but part of neuroscience 
kind of like a humanity which is very philosophical and interacting with linguistics and with psychology and with people 
and i think parts of physics that have become like this as well and beautiful to be in a 
like that sc i totally agree and i was trying to refrain from asking you to define consciousness or 
like that not your thing right la not so much and a whole other hour laughter sc right i 
many working neuroscientists i think that people on the street maybe get the misimpression that what neuroscientists do they 
around arguing about what consciousness is but a lot still to be done in what chalmers called the easy 
of consciousness which is like just how the brain gets through the day forget about thinking of itself and 
experiences of the redness of red but how we see things and react to them and probably part of 
the embodied cognition paradigm is trying to figure things out la yes i think so sc all right la 
goal sc lisa azizzadeh thank you so much for this conversation la thank you thank you music a great 
for your podcast would be christina hoffsummers she is the author of many books but one that might be 
basis of a great discussion would be science on women and i had not heard of the stomach problems 
people with autism before i thought the subclassification of possible overlapping disorders was interesting i do wonder if there 
a comorbidity of aspergers and adhd especially with respect to hyperfocus and people on the spectrum having intense interest 
certain subjects the lack of motor skills made me think of feynman when he wrote about his fear of 
to throw a ball when it landed near him was never any good in sports i was always terrified 
a tennis ball would come over the fence and land near me because i never could get it over 
usually went about a radian off of where it was supposed to what about individualism and mirror neurons should 
instead make room for people with different types of neurology because there may be a benefit if a society 
a diverse neurology if someone is left handed are they more right brained are their brains organized in a 
different way is their corpus callusum thicker pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast lisa azizzadeh on embodied cognition mirror neurons 
empathy three quarks daily nice feynman quote re individualism i think there was any argument against neurodiversity if anything 
aziz seems prodiversity i know that about autism and microbiota either the lack of coordination would make sense curious 
lack of coordination is measured how wide of a spectrum it is and if it corresponds to the spectrum 
differing microbiota pardon my awkward phrasing i found this episode really charming thanks comments are closed sean carroll hosts
