sean carroll hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today going to have a 
if perhaps slightly depressing episode or at least slightly putting us in the mode of worrying about really profound 
that is the concept of existential risks or even lesser than that catastrophic or extreme risks that we face 
a species so we all know that something happened in the century we gained the technological ability to really 
enormous harm to ourselves as a species there was always times back in history when human beings could harm 
other but these days we can imagine human beings truly wreaking havoc on the whole planet or the whole 
what we mean by extreme or catastrophic or existential risks so guest is martin rees lord rees baron of 
low he is officially a lord in the british hierarchy there he actually sits in the house of lords 
votes and so forth but martin is also one of the leading theoretical astrophysicist of our age done enormously 
work in high energy astrophysics understanding black holes and galaxies and things like that sc but over the last 
or two gained an interest in these big questions of human life and where humanity is going towards the 
so one of the cofounders of the center for the study of existential risks at cambridge university and mostly 
we talk about today a lot of risks out there of course the first to really come on the 
was nuclear war and still out there and we talk about that one but now all sorts of biothreats 
well as cyber threats as well as artificial intelligence not to mention the sort of natural disasters of asteroids 
solar flares and earthquakes that could cause enormous harm a really interesting science problem but also a philosophical problem 
asking how to judge an extremely unlikely event versus if that event happens it will be catastrophic for everybody 
so the classic example of this is what if the large hadron collider create a black hole and destroyed 
the earth unlikely to happen but do you really wanna risk it this is a really really good question 
we get into this we get into how to deal with all these questions but then being who we 
talking about life on earth eventually turns into life on other planets and actually in the last half of 
discussion talking about life elsewhere in the universe again something that martin is a world expert in and we 
about why we seen it yet what forms it could take what we can learn about life on earth 
thinking about life on other planets so we start off with some downtoearth depressing topics but very optimistic and 
there by the end so tune in gonna like this one go music sc okay martin rees welcome to 
mindscape podcast martin rees good to be with you sc so done a lot of work obviously on cosmology 
energy astrophysics and so forth but a relatively recent interest of yours has been the future of humanity the 
that we face and so i thought we could start just with a worked example and we can think 
how to think about this so as someone done particle physics in quantum field theory my favorite worked example 
what if the large hadron collider created either a black hole or some exotic particle that then ate up 
earth and i was surprised to learn by reading your books that you had actually thought about this and 
of the first people to really wonder about this mr well i got the idea from someone else but 
thought it was a good worked example because obviously very very unlikely but the consequence are catastrophic that i 
not stupid to query this and there were some people who of course did query this and they were 
of poopooed a bit by the people at cern or hadron but although we think very very unlikely i 
it does raise a nontrivial issue because there was a committee set up at cern to address this and 
said with great confidence that on the basis of all theories this happen but obviously the level of confidence 
want is something like a billion or trillion to one given the consequences and the reason i think not 
to worry is that supposing you were up before an american congressional committee to address this issue and you 
the chances are a billion to and then they say to you carroll are you really saying it is 
than a one in a billion chance that would you say yes to that sc yes mr and so 
the main risk is that our theory is completely wrong or something totally unenvisioned sc a systematic error mr 
could happen when you explore a part of parameter space never been explored by nature itself sc maybe for 
benefit of the audience could you explain a little bit about what it would be that could go wrong 
the lhc that would cause us all to be killed mr well i yeah just quoting the other experts 
idea is a mini black hole the other idea is turning material into called strangelets which would gradually sort 
gobble up the earth and turn it into some compact structure and these have been speculated about by particle 
no one thinks likely and here talking about this because when i have talked about in the past be 
headlines they would start about things that the accelerator will destroy the world and i think that but i 
think that something which is quite right that one should address and i try to think what i would 
if i was before the congressional committee i think i would say that the chance is very very small 
i would then say you like to ask me the chance something we discovered in this accelerator will solve 
energy problems and i would say very very but supposing that you thought that was a one thousand times 
small than the chance of destroying anything then that might tilt the balance sc right fair mr and so 
way i would explain why i actually despite uncertainty about my theory feel we be inhibited with going ahead 
these experiments sc well okay a very good point what if that were not true so i think this 
a good thing because i wanna get on the table what is the theory of thinking about these terrible 
things where the chance is very small but the consequences are disastrous so suggesting that one of the things 
think about is other really really small probabilities that might be good rather than bad mr yes right and 
course be never possible to quantify but of course a risk in doing anything which may have potential upsides 
used to that in the testing of new drugs and everything like that and so when we get to 
colossal risks then again the same argument applies that we might be forgoing benefits as freeman dyson put it 
one of his articles as a hidden cost of saying no sc right the example i used in my 
particle at the end of the was every time you open a jar of pasta sauce a chance that 
terrible mutation has happened inside and gonna release a pathogen that destroys millions of people a very very small 
yes yes sc but it never stops us from opening the jar mr no no no but of course 
does have to be cautious and if you think of something which could be globally catastrophic then you get 
philosophical questions about just how much worse an existential catastrophe is then a very bad one and to express 
if you consider two scenarios one is the death of of the people in the world scenario two is 
death of a of the people in the world and you ask the question much worse is scenario two 
scenario you could say worse the body but some people would say much much much worse because there you 
a potentiality of all future development and future lives and fortunate that if we think of all these scenarios 
have been discussed apart from these rather crazy ones from particle physics very hard to imagine anything to wipe 
all human beings sc right you were very careful in your formulation there saying some people would say that 
much much worse than what is your feeling personally mr yes well i do think the case because one 
which we learn as astronomers is that we humans are not the culmination of evolution taken four billion years 
us to emerge from the primordial slime as it were but the time ahead even for the earth is 
billion years sc yeah mr and the universe has a much longer future and like to quote woody allen 
is very long especially towards the so no reason to think that even a halfway stage in the emergent 
and of course if intelligence is rare and as some people think we are the only intelligent species in 
galaxy then our fate as humans is of galactic importance not just terrestrial importance because if we wipe ourselves 
that would destroy these potentialities so i think it is much worse to envisage wiping out everyone than having 
catastrophe which is a setback to civilization sc yeah there are definitely implications of these ideas for questions about 
elsewhere and i do want to talk about that but stay down here on earth for just a minute 
i think what getting at and something that i thought of as i was reading your books is that 
talk about existential risks or these terrible disasters but there really is a hierarchy of them right the one 
which a million people die which is incredibly terribly bad one of which most human beings die one of 
all human beings die one in which all life dies here on earth right and i think safe to 
we can contemplate all of these there are scenarios for any one of these to actually happen mr exceedingly 
but all scenarios yes sc right right mr and i think incidentally in my book which is called on 
future i do discuss some of these scenarios and one point i make is that if we think of 
intermediatelevel scenarios then they will all cascade globally in a way that happen previously you may know the book 
jared diamond called collapse where he talks about the way i think five different civilizations collapsed but in none 
those cases did the collapse spread globally whereas now i think any really severe setback in any part of 
world will have consequences because we are so interconnected by telecommunications supply chains air travel and everything else so 
would spread globally and something new and another thing which worries me very much is that i think society 
much more fragile than in the past mr to give an example if you think back to the middle 
when the black death bubonic plague killed half the population of many towns the rest went on fatalistically whereas 
if we had some pandemic once the number of cases overwhelmed hospitals be a breakdown in social order if 
clamor for treatment that available and likewise so dependent on electricity that if there were a massive cyber attack 
say the east coast of the united states then be a complete anarchy within a few days nothing would 
and indeed that is realized because i quote in my book a two thousand twelve report from the american 
of defense which talks about that scenario and says that if it were instigated by a hostile state it 
merit a nuclear response sc that would be helpful chuckle mr yeah sc clear to me that this is 
be somewhat of a downer of a conversation i should let people know that by nature a very optimistic 
actually right i mean a lot of optimism about technology mr cheer for this brexit laughter sc it does 
okay yeah so you mentioned the interconnectedness and how that potentially would allow disasters to spread and propagate but 
the same time the related fact that technology has given us a kind of leverage over our future for 
and for bad that we have a one hundred years ago right the century introduced for the first time 
would say the possibility we could extinguish ourselves mr yes well nuclear initially of course yeah sc right so 
different kind of question that we really been trained to think about to use the number billions to one 
if the probability of wiping out the earth and maybe you got that number by taking one over the 
of the earth laughter sc but is that the right calculus is there any quantitative way of thinking about 
we should measure existential risk and how we should respond to it mr well i think there was i 
when i am in a storeroom people say do you worry about asteroids etcetera and of course i worry 
because the one risk you can quantify pretty accurately we now know when arrive or how big they are 
the impacts would be etcetera but the point about asteroids is that the probability of impact is no higher 
than the prehistoric times sc not our fault mr and the concerns that we should have in the forefront 
our mind are those which are emergent and which are probably increasing nuclear war was the first one of 
kind with misuse of bio and cyber tech new concerns and i do think that not enough attention given 
these a complacency that if something has never happened you worry about it but if an event which is 
serious that even one occurrence is too often we ought to think about this and been involved in setting 
a center here in cambridge to address these extreme risks the argument being that a huge amount of effort 
into moderate risks like carcinogens in food making trains and playing safer and all that but these improbable events 
are perhaps growing in probability as time goes on can lead us into complacency and we really ought to 
about how we can minimize these risks and what would we do if they happened and i think in 
center if we can reduce the probability of any of these things by one part in a thousand then 
stakes are so high if we lived more and earned our keep sc right morbidly fascinated by solar flares 
are certainly a natural phenomenon that has happened many times but i met a lawyer who had worked on 
commission where they thought about this and very concerned about the idea that once every thousand years a solar 
that would be big enough to wipe out the entire electrical grid here on earth so a combination of 
naturally occurring thing and a vulnerability that we have invented for it but again the time scales are things 
we are not adapted to dealing with mr no right but an example of something where solar flares can 
satellites for instance they could be a hardened to minimize that impact and worth doing but right in saying 
there are some natural phenomena whose consequence is greater now because we depend on electricity more and of course 
consequence of an earthquake in tokyo is more now than it would have been three hundred years ago because 
the number of people involved sc well and in los angeles where i live mr of course yes yes 
the buildings fall down because the buildings are now cleverly constructed but we will not have electricity or water 
a long time if the earthquake hits in the right place and the real worry safe here in cambridge 
no earthquakes chuckle mr right there was a reported one of hitting in england a few times ago and 
that the budgerigar fell off its perch but nothing much worse than that happens sc it would not even 
reported where from but also a philosophy question here that i thought you highlighted in the book even when 
use phrases like a billion to one chance mr yes sc what does that mean because not like done 
a billion times and seen it happen once mr yeah yeah sc so how do we interpret phrases like 
kind of probability mr well of course there are some contexts where it is meaningful if you have something 
you left village being turned or something like that then you can quantify it but of course as you 
we quantify any probability if it yet happened and the reason why we may tend to underestimate so we 
it sc well i tend to be a subjectivist about probability i know if you have strong feelings about 
philosophy of probability but as a good bayesian i think that all probabilities are more or less on the 
footing related to our credence that something is going to happen but just harder to accurately put them down 
well not true of coin tossing or of things like that there are some where probabilistic estimates do make 
and have some basis sc well if see if an eternalist if you think the past present and future 
equally real then the outcome of a coin toss is just your ignorance about the future you can relate 
you can obviously give a sensible justification for having a certain credence but i think philosophically different but it 
raise the the famous question in science is that what is the what are error bars on your error 
right mr of course sc when you say well it is billion to one could it be just a 
to one something like that is this the kind of thing that your center worries about mr well i 
it could be because that probably there are theories that are wrong is of course not all that small 
right right and always hard to quantify mr and why utter surprises be ruled out and of course they 
quantified sc yeah mr and that is i think the reason why we completely dismiss the concerns about doing 
for the first time which has never happened in nature of course when we talk about these big experiments 
many cases and indeed been writing papers about this you can say that nature has done the experiment already 
rays of high energy have collided and nothing disastrous has happened and the fact that we can see stars 
dwarfs that are not turned into strange tell us something but it is a potential effect that we can 
artificially which we think ever happened in nature then we perhaps should be open minded sc yeah mr but 
take this too far i think anything in nature which is at a temperature of a million degree kelvin 
we have huge worries when we first cooled something down to a very low temperature like that i suppose 
we had very great confidence in the physics sc yeah it does have to do a theoretical i wanna 
bias but we have to proceed on the basis of thinking that our theories captures some truth right captures 
element of reality when we make these otherwise like you say we do anything anything would bear some worries 
some sense but i like this example of the large hadron collider and how we can ask whether nature 
done it already because it gives a little bit of an insight to people who are not in this 
that not flying completely blind there is a process through which people do think about how you might rule 
the likelihood of these existential problems and you make the very good point in your book that which i 
not really thought of before that we have an obligation to make that reason public to inform people about 
we think this you really you make it clear that we just say trust the scientists on this we 
to spread our reasoning widely mr well i think especially when the scientists want to do the experiment and 
an interest in it so i think in that sort of case good to have some independent group of 
who can sort of reassure themselves without having any selfinterest in the experiment that say and although i want 
make a big deal of the accelerator i worry about it at all to be honest sc me neither 
there you know mr no no but i think in the case of bioexperiments then this is a real 
and it need to take one example there were two groups which in two thousand eleven i think it 
one in wisconsin one in holland showed it was surprisingly easy to make the flu virus more variant more 
and these so called gain of function experiments were denied us federal funding for a number of years because 
were thought risky because first of all this is dangerous knowledge which perhaps you want to publish one question 
also does the risk of error releasing something and now possible to theorize the small pox virus and things 
that and we do have to worry about are there some experiments where the risk of something going wrong 
such that you even do the experiment sc right mr and these are context where of course there are 
and you just allow experiments to do anything they like because we are concerned about prudential constraints and ethical 
on biological experiments and it is a regime of regulation as you know for the use of modern ideas 
genetics etcetera but of course what worries me and this is really a theme of my book is that 
regulations one establishes even if internationally agreed actually be enforced regulations on nuclear activities can be enforced because they 
special purpose conspicuous facilities and so the iaea can monitor these things but when we think about biological experiments 
can be done in a lab with the facilities that exist in many industries and many universities and of 
cyber attacks of pretty damaging consequences can be done just by a lone weirdo etcetera and we really stop 
like that or unethical experiments on human embryos and things like that being done and my concern is that 
can be done will be done somewhere by someone whatever the regulations say and enforcing those regulations globally would 
as hopeless as enforcing the drug laws globally or the tax laws globally and so what scares me and 
you ask me what are the concerns i have in the next ten years not being too futuristic then 
is the misuse by error or by design of biotech or cyber tech sc yeah i think that exactly 
and it raises a couple of questions so like you say we have regulatory standards in place on the 
hand they seem to be easy to circumvent by a bad actor so is that an argument for actually 
controlled research go on so i mean you just keep knowledge in the box gonna get it it might 
well be ours as well as someone mr very difficult to say that we do research you can obviously 
the rate by controlling the funding but you really stop the research although obviously if the research is intrinsically 
or intrinsically unethical then we should try and ban it but as i say very hard to enforce these 
globally and in the context of bio and cyber i think there is going to be a growing tension 
three things we want to preserve liberty privacy and security and of course this is an issue that comes 
when you talk about regulating the internet and all that and i think if you want to have global 
you run into the problem that different parts of the world would adjust the balance differently i think the 
would care less about privacy and more about security than the united states would and europe somewhere between but 
are very serious issues which need to be addressed sc what is the state of international cooperation on issues 
this mr well obviously in health there is a world health organisation etcetera but nothing yet established in the 
domain and the problem there of course is that the companies are global sc and they have vested interest 
doing certain things that other people might not want to be done mr right so i think the serious 
of governance of the internet which are being addressed but i think enforcing them is going to be pretty 
and unless you have really firm controls on the internet which is quite contrary to the initial spirits and 
of tim bernerslee and the other pioneers where they wanted it to be free sc but is it even 
could we do it could we really regulate the internet that easily not an expert in mr well not 
expert either but i think one can have sort of censorship of content to some extent but as regards 
hardware and minimizing the risk of hacking i know what can be done as these are serious issues and 
get more serious and i think one of the most depressing things i find about the way technology is 
is that the fraction of efforts that go into security and all the things that be needed if we 
all honest is getting larger and larger sc yeah and it feeds back into this idea that the time 
this is sort of a mismatch of time scales great promise in doing research in biology or medicine or 
technological infrastructure and also great dangers but this worry that we race towards the promise and the rewards first 
then try to fix up security later right mr yeah yeah sc is there some sort of global philosophical 
we might try to work toward to be more secure in our technological advancements mr well i think we 
all campaign for this but we know how hard it is to get international agreements on anything climate construal 
all that sort of thing sc yeah and sitting here in the united kingdom which has just decided to 
the rest of europe you know hard to keep international organizations together and also sitting here just a few 
after it was announced that jeff phone was hacked by saudi arabia so even the best protected people in 
world could be very vulnerable mr right sc so what about i mean maybe be useful to get on 
table a list of your favorite existential risks in some sense chuckle obviously mentioned nuclear weapons bio or let 
be a little bit more specific about your top ten dangers mr i think want to avoid the word 
because the idea of wiping ourselves out is something which is relevant only to these rather science fictionlike scenarios 
the name of your center the center for existential risk mr it is and i think extreme risks or 
risks would be a more appropriate representation of what we actually do sc good mr and as i say 
think these are the downsides of exciting new technologies bio and cyber being the most prominent and of course 
class of concerns are those which are emerging from our collective impact on the planet you know the climate 
is one and associated loss of bio diversity etcetera these are a class of longterm threats which everyone is 
of which are because of our collective actions rather than a few bad actors as in the other cases 
again very hard to get effective action because politicians tend to focus naturally on the immediate and the parochial 
think up to the next election and they think about their own constituents etcetera mr and very very hard 
get prioritization of the action which is needed to minimize these global risks where the community the global community 
to act collectively and seeing this in the context of climate change and attempts to reduce emission so i 
two things about this what one thing which i feel quite strongly in the uk context is that we 
set a target of cutting our net emissions to zero by the year this is a very challenging target 
will need some new technology and i support the idea that we should have a very strong program to 
clean energy better batteries and all that sort of thing but the reason i support this is that if 
succeed then we will reduce our emissions to zero but only of the emissions so neither here nor there 
i think we in britain can claim to have produced more than of the clever ideas up till now 
and certainly a disproportionate number and so if we do have a crash program that does lead to cheaper 
storage etcetera etcetera so that india for instance can leapfrog directly to clean energy when it needs a grid 
not build coal fired power stations we will thereby do far more than to reducing world emissions and it 
be hard to imagine a more inspiring goal for young engineers than to provide clean energy for the developing 
and so why i think a strong case for enhancing rd there and i would say the same thing 
research into plant science and bio because feeding nine billion people by midcentury is another challenge and this requires 
agriculture if one is to do this without encroaching on natural forests etcetera etcetera mr and here again going 
need new technology which the scientifically advanced countries of which we are one can make a disproportionate contribution to 
i would say that if we prioritize research into those areas things to do with clean energy and storage 
into improved plant science etcetera then we not only help ourselves but help the world so one thing a 
but thinking about the politics then i know people been scientific advisors to government and they normally get rather 
because the politicians have their urgent agenda etcetera and very hard to get them to prioritize something which is 
term sc scientists are thinking more long term yes mr yeah yeah yes okay but why i think that 
can have more effect if they go public and become small time carl as it were because then they 
have an influence and politicians will respond if they think the voters are behind them and so i think 
the scientists can do is to publicize the issues in a way that the public responds to because then 
public will influence the politicians and the politicians will feel that they can take these actions without losing votes 
going to give two examples one example which i found rather surprising is the pope because in two thousand 
there was a big scientific conference at the vatican which had all the world experts in climate and people 
jeffrey sachs and joe stiglitz etcetera which discussed these environmental and climatic threats of the world mr and that 
input into the encyclical in and that encyclical got him a standing ovation at the un and of course 
an influence on his billion followers in latin america africa and east asia and help to ease the path 
consensus at the paris conference in december two thousand fifteen because the people in those countries knew that lots 
people would support this and as more parochial version in this country one of our less enlightened politicians proposed 
to limit the production of nonreusable plastics drinking straws and things of that kind and he only did that 
had a year or two ago the blue planet ii programmes funded by david attenborough which showed the effect 
plastics in the ocean and especially iconic picture of a albatross returning to his nest and coughing up for 
young not the long for nourishment but some bits of plastic mr and become an iconic image rather like 
polar bear and the melting ice floe was for the climate campaigns and because millions of people saw that 
there was public support for the idea of cutting down the use of plastics and that certainly become quite 
effective campaign in this country so if the public cares about something then politicians will respond even if long 
and part of a global campaign and why we should encourage and value the scientists who are able to 
through to the wide public because more effective than being a science advisor inhouse to government or politicians sc 
no a very a very interesting point that if a saying if scientist wants to have a real impact 
public policy then the public should be as much as the target as the politician mr yes yes yes 
because politicians respond to in the inbox and in the press and what they think their voters want obviously 
so that can be influenced by charismatic public figures with the scientific background sc good very good and so 
want to get back up a little bit because maybe we can be a little bit more specific as 
example of good action here if you think that britain wants to be zero emissions by mr yes sc 
would that involve what kind of technology is that obviously some renewable energies some storage but can we be 
specific mr well i mean i think storage more cheaper more efficient batteries and one has to store the 
from day to night and maybe even seasonally so we have to do that i personally think it would 
nuclear sc okay mr and of course this is controversial but i think the problem of nuclear is been 
real rd in the last twenty years the designs being used really date back from the and i think 
that in trying to develop clean energy that should include fourth generation nuclear and things like small modular reactors 
could be put on the back of a truck and be a hundred megawatt each or something like that 
something like that would be safer and hopefully if they could be massproduced more economical so i think that 
is probably going to be part of the answer without that going to be harder sc so do you 
that the the related issue is there with not emissions but still nuclear waste do you think that those 
solvable mr i think they are yes i mean there are a problem but i think they can be 
with and incidentally i think people worry too much about low radiation levels sc another place where scientists maybe 
have a various impact somehow mr yes yes sc explaining that this is not so bad mr yes well 
is a dread factor in a radiation it mr yes right sc and well to digress a bit i 
very important to have clear guidelines about the dangers because suppose a dirty bomb were let off in a 
in new york or something like that then people might look at some table of risks and say got 
evacuate this street for the next thirty years which may be a sort of overthetop but after an event 
that is not the time to have the debate you have to have the debate beforehand and of course 
example of this which is we have studied at our center is the aftermath of the fukushima disaster in 
which was serious but the evacuation was overthetop and probably caused far more distress than the radiation itself would 
done sc i know that actually yeah they over evacuated mr they over evacuated yes and i think what 
to happen is there should be sort of guidelines which are made available to every city about what the 
risk is for multicolored level because if i was an old villager in japan be prepared to accept a 
higher risk of cancer in order to live out my days in my home rather than being evacuated and 
ought to be given that choice and of course old people might make a different choice from people with 
children but there ought to be some rational way in which people can make that choice otherwise there would 
an overreaction and this is something which is particularly the case in terms of radiation sc this is just 
human foible though right very bad at talking rationally about what happens to us in extreme situations where when 
lives are at risk like once you say to an old villager there is radiation here worry about it 
can stay here old and gonna die like this is not an easy conversation to have mr yeah yeah 
well i think have to actually ask them in advance you could ask everyone you know well if what 
will you had to tolerate if the alternative is evacuating from your home sc yeah yeah but yeah i 
what the answer is i mean there certainly is a philosophy question here a whole bunch of them are 
heavily involved in your center when making decisions about these big big questions mr yes well in fact one 
our senior people is a philosopher and is particularly concerned about the issue of future generations because there is 
question of what discount rate you apply and how much we should think about future generations rather than those 
are now alive this is a real question and in fact we have set up a parliamentary committee to 
and raise the amount of attention given in old legislation to the effect in the long term because many 
the things doing are having some effect obviously this is something we ought to try and emphasize and not 
the future as much as a commercial transaction does sc have you found politicians more or less responsive to 
mr well i think they are responsive as long as the sacrifice for the present generation too much but 
is important obviously to think longer term and to realize that even though if you make a commercial decision 
an office building or something if you get your money back in thirty or forty years you do it 
in making a decision that may affect the longer term future people do care about the life experiences of 
born today still be alive in the early part of the century sc i get that already mr and 
we ought to think longer term hard to predict of course because things are changing so fast and one 
the points i make in my book is that at first sight paradoxical that in medieval times when people 
very limited horizons and when they thought the world might end in a thousand years they still built cathedrals 
be finished in their lifetime that might seem paradoxical but whereas now we would not do something like that 
see but the reason not paradoxical is that in medieval times even though they thought the whole world might 
they thought the lives of their children and their grandchildren would be more or less like theirs so the 
would appreciate the completed cathedral whereas now i think we have very much confidence in predicting what everyday life 
be like fifty years from now given the changes that have been in the last fifty years and so 
that reason i think rational to not plan quite so far ahead in some context but on the other 
if a risk of doing something which is irreversible longterm damage we ought surly to care about future generations 
does the example of the environment and climate it has some depressing aspects in how resistant certain quarters have 
to the obvious scientific evidence how much do you worry about misinformation or just vested interests resisting the scientific 
mr well very much so of course and this is apparent in that context of climate change where the 
is of course very difficult and is very uncertain got to accept uncertain but i think we do have 
worry about the reluctance to accept scientific evidence not in that context alone but in the dangers of vaccines 
things of that kind another example where of course a lot of misinformation which is damaging sc being from 
angeles well aware of this phenomenon the epicenter of that particular phenomenon but climate change is also an interesting 
because so different in character than something like a nuclear war or even a terrorist nuclear bomb right slowly 
up on all of us versus a tiny fraction every year that it would happen is it a different 
different mental space you need to be in to attack these different problems mr i think it is and 
think of course in both cases hard because in the case of the sudden catastrophe then the point is 
because never happened and you think it never will like in the stock market where it keeps on rising 
it will rise forever mr and you think go on but then a sudden fall no symmetry between the 
of rises and the speed of falls and similarly you think that things are going to be okay and 
and one of your predecessors is a darwin lecturer mr taleb who made some rather good points about pareto 
where things are below average of the time laughter mr and a long tale important sc right yeah and 
fill in a little bit i wanna get all these different kinds of extreme risks i think is a 
way of putting it and i think most people know about climate change in fact we talked about it 
this podcast the nuclear threat which maybe was larger in the past for a largescale nuclear war these days 
you much more worried about one bomb being taken into a port and blown up mr yes right i 
we can say that during the cold war there was a risk of a real catastrophe because there were 
bombs on both sides and if they had gone off then that would have devastated much of the northern 
certainly europe and north america sc and there were at least a couple of moments when it was about 
real chance mr well indeed and i think when we see what people said well mcnamara in his later 
and kennedy saying that the risk was between one in three and evens and all that and of course 
other false alarms that learned about i think we realized just how great the threat was and for those 
us in europe i think the realistic estimate of the risk during the cold war was probably one in 
or something like that and hard to quantify obviously but i think looking back there was a substantial chance 
i personally think that if people had realized that they would have been a bit more questioning of the 
policy for my part i have been prepared to risk a one in three or even one in six 
of a nuclear exchange of that kind even if the alternative was a soviet takeover of the whole of 
and i suspect many people have taken that view but they really feel that there was this real risk 
right and saying those words out loud is also gets you in trouble politically maybe a little bit mr 
it might have been for some people at that time but i think realistically i think that will be 
trade of that been far better to let the soviets take over than to have destruction of the whole 
of europe so that was the situation of the cold war but as you say that particular scenario is 
least in abeyance because the number of weapons on both sides has been clocked by the factor of but 
the other hand there are two things to worry about well actually three things one is that there are 
nuclear powers so now ten nuclear powers and the risk of some nuclear weapons going off in a regional 
in the middle east or india or pakistan is probably higher than ever sc yeah mr and that would 
a regional disaster unless it produced on such big forest fires they do have in nuclear winter but it 
probably just be a regional effect so one concern but the other point is that the global threat may 
just in abeyance because it could be that as a new standoff in the second half of the century 
in new superpowers present less well or less luckily than the cold war was so a concern and the 
concern is again something been having meetings about here the risk of cyber attacks of the nuclear infrastructure is 
new threat because obviously very complicated sc so what exactly is the threat there that a cyber hacker could 
what mr could trigger false alarms or even trigger bombs going off sc right okay mr and this one 
that being addressed sc yes one hopes mr and it is being addressed but on the other hand in 
these cyber issues an arms race between the cyber attackers who are indeed aided by ai and of course 
who are trying to secure things so this is a new concern a new class of risks quite apart 
old fashion types of false alarms sc and the lone actor who is not even a state is a 
worry for nuclear weapons right mr yes i know to what extent a lone actor could realistically do that 
i think a small stake sc and presumably it becomes not less likely over time right as technology leaks 
as the information gets out as more and more plutonium and uranium are flying around what kind of risk 
it possible to quantify that we have mr well i venture to quantify but obviously there are far greater 
this is just another instance of how a small group of people amplified in their impact by modern technology 
have a consequence that cascades globally this is what i worry about as i put it in my book 
village will have village but they will have a global range now which they in the past sc and 
the biological worry bigger in your mind than the nuclear worry i guess two categories right sort of poisons 
anthrax that you can spread and then these contagious agents that you can imagine and they both sound terrible 
yes yes i think the consequences of a natural pandemic could be worse of course sars on global effect 
it only spread to places that could cope with it i mean singapore and toronto mainly but had something 
spread to one of the mega cities of the developing world like mumbai or casablanca or something then it 
have been very very serious and true of any future one and of course we have plan for thing 
that kind how would you cope would you turn off the mobile phones because they spread panic and rumor 
would you leave them on so you could spread information a sort of sociological issue which needs to be 
in planning for these disasters sc which should you do now you have me curious mr well again i 
but an example of a context where you need social scientists to explore what is the optimum thing sc 
run the simulation mr yes so i think we do need to worry about natural pandemics and of course 
pandemics and also we certainly have to worry about the ethical consequences of new technology already this is an 
with the chinese experiments on human embryos and all that sc that guy got arrested right the guy who 
to have genetically engineered a baby mr yes in fact all the chinese scientists were equally opposed to what 
had done the balance of benefits and risks was not such as to justify it whereas one can justify 
geneediting if you remove the gene for huntington disease or something like that but what he was doing was 
by almost everyone to be unethical but we do have to worry about the widespread understanding and availability of 
techniques and of course we have to worry about the social effects of these if they can be used 
human enhancement for instance i think most people think that if you can remove some severe potentiality of the 
then okay but if you can use genetic modification for enhancement then different but fortunately a long way in 
future because most qualities that we might want to have in human beings your looks and intelligence etcetera they 
complicated combinations of thousands of genes sc very very complicated mr so before you can do that got to 
use ai on some very large sample of genomes to decide which optimal and then be able to synthesize 
genome and be confident not gonna have unintended downsides so fortunately a long way in the future but if 
happened then that would be a new fundamental kind of inequality that have to worry about and it would 
be a bad news because if we think of the effects of medical advances in the last century had 
beneficial effect on promoting equality because cutting down an infectious disease in africa for instance as are the huge 
on infant mortality i think we can say looking back that medical advances have been beneficial not just for 
who have them but for promoting equality worldwide whereas these future ones may have the reverse effect sc in 
sense because now inventing medical procedures that are just financially out of the reach of so many people yeah 
it is a good point to segue into something because the topic of extreme risks and then also the 
of extreme benefits and some of these technologies are ambiguous transformative human geneediting ai more things that stumbling across 
now in the century and certainly an example where some people are gonna wanna just rush ahead without thinking 
the consequences mr well again we stop it and we control it just like we control the drug laws 
the tax laws and perhaps in a way if some crazy people want to do this perhaps we should 
be too upset because obviously every technology in medicine starts off as risky i mean heart transplants and things 
that and then become more routine and so perhaps we should not be too upset if a few people 
to modify themselves in ways that turn out not to be as beneficial as they help and of course 
like enhancing your brain by some cyborg implant into your brain i mean it would be great if we 
improve our memories and all that and so perhaps a good thing that some people are talking with a 
face about the potential of doing this sc i mean as you said hard but just imagine because doing 
the future imagine someone develops a diagnostic test that lets you screen thousands of embryos and pick out the 
that will be the most intelligent and less prospective parents take advantage of this technology would that be bad 
not necessarily of course interesting to know whether they would see more intelligence because there was the famous case 
mr shockley do you remember who was shockley was the inventor of the transistor he set up a sperm 
for nobel prize winners sc oh right mr glad to say there was very little demand sc i guess 
true i just wonder again on a philosophical level a ickyness factor but i think maybe sort of engineering 
sounds weird dr strangelovey but maybe just an inevitability about it also once people get over that gonna be 
for granted well of course we should make babies as good as we can and i honestly personally have 
strong understanding one way or the other mr yeah yeah no no maybe we should but as you said 
is a yucky or icky factor about some genetic modification even in animals and i think the reason why 
crops were opposed in europe was because people associated genetic modification with things like making a rabbit glow in 
dark by putting jellyfish genes in it or something of that kind which did promote the yuck factor rather 
circus animals being given silly clothes to wear not what you should do to animals and people felt the 
about that and that really perhaps went against the support for the use of gm techniques in very good 
sc and certainly we be irresponsible not to mention favorite new extreme risk which is super intelligent artificial intelligence 
do you have an opinion on whether or not a real risk or a fake one mr well whether 
risk or opportunity we know but i think obviously the question is where general intelligence we know already had 
fifty years machines can do arithmetic better than any human being and of course now got machines that can 
chess better any human being and do many other things but of course still many things they do as 
as a human and the question is will they be able to acquire common sense as it were requiring 
capabilities and ai is very very valuable for coping with large data sets and optimizing complex systems like the 
grid of a traffic flow and incidentally the chinese will be able to have a planned economy of a 
that marx could only have dreamt of because they have records of all transactions all stocks in the shop 
so that they could do that mr so ai does have tremendous power to cope with complex systems but 
regards the sort of robots which we can treat as intelligent beings as in the movies quite a long 
away because robots are still rather bad at interacting with the real environment they even move pieces on a 
board as well as a kid can they jump from tree to tree as well as a squirrel can 
a long way to go before robots have that sort of agility and interaction and before they have any 
for the external world because someone told me that the watson computer which won the game of jeopardy was 
which is bigger a shoe box or mount everest and answer mr and then because obviously it it understands 
and things but it has no concept of the external world etcetera and to give a machine that concept 
indeed to get you understand human behavior is a big challenge a big challenge because from the perspective everything 
do is very very slow and computers learn by looking at million of examples of pages to translate or 
of cats and all that and recognize them but watching human beings is like us watching trees grow very 
and they accumulate the amount of data in order to really understand that and so a big impediment so 
long way of saying that i think be a long time before we have human general intelligence in a 
of saying which behaves like a human being or lower obviously we will have machines that can cope with 
data sets and a clean up on the stock market and all those things sc right so of course 
the getting artificial intelligence up to general human scales will be hard right but do you think possible in 
mr no fundamental objection to it i suppose because you could imagine in principle a machine which has sensors 
allows it to interact with the real world and maybe even communicate with human beings so not impossible but 
whether be a motive for it i know because i think what got to remember is that a gap 
what could be done and what economical or social motive for doing and why something surge very very fast 
level off just to digress for a bit the most rapid technology ever really is smartphones which have developed 
spread globally within a decade or so but probably they will saturate now the iphone eleven is probably as 
as you want a smartphone to be and so probably twenty years from now be using similar smartphones mr 
so a sigmoid curve is what happens to most individual technologies and then something else will take over and 
think got to be mindful of the point made in the famous book by robert gordon about the important 
advances and he makes the point that what happened between one thousand eight hundred seventy and one thousand nine 
fifty in electricity the railways television cars and all that that was more important than anything that has happened 
and something in that and let me give you another example aviation alcock and brown first transatlantic flight fifty 
after that the first commercial flight of jumbo jet and now fifty years after that still a jumbo jet 
the concorde came and went and so an example of how technology developed when a motive but then it 
off when things are final when no economically feasible way of developing it further and we got to realize 
that may happen to some of these information technologies which are developing very fast so we assume that because 
so fast now that there will be equally rapid changes in the next ten or twenty years but be 
obviously sc yeah in the case of the smartphone i guess the obvious next big phase transition would be 
get a direct interface with the brain and the computer mr right now be very big jump of course 
sc but not quite there yet people are trying but not to be the next five years mr yes 
sc okay but still if artificial intelligence could even if not precisely human even if it pass the turing 
there is a worry in certain circles that it will nevertheless be powerful and it have the same values 
we do you can imagine something that is hyper intelligent along some axes and yet all that interested in 
flourishing is that something you worry about mr well of course got to worry about two things first of 
if we have the internet of things then of course that means that hard to avoid a scenario where 
ai can interact with the real external world it be kept in its box but the question is does 
have what motives would it have we just know i think not it has motives but it may do 
which are contrary to human interests obviously a possibility true of any machine sc and is there any way 
mean we can sit and fret about it is there any strategy for planning for that i mean many 
names have started warning about this but not quite sure what the actionable thing to do it is mr 
i see it in principle different from volume the misuse of any other technology really so i worry so 
about that sc you worry so much about that okay very good what is your more positive spin on 
ai can do for us or what these kinds of technologies will help us achieve mr well i think 
it can optimally cope with networks electricity grids and things of that kind and obviously it can help scientists 
discoveries and i think to take one example if you want to have a roomtemperature superconductor then as you 
the best bets are these rather complicated compounds and things sc materials yeah mr and rather than do lots 
experiments than maybe ai can explore the parameter space and come up with that and ditto with drug development 
i think it can help and perhaps moving closer to our own field of science i think it may 
us to understand some fundamental problems in cosmology because supposing that some version of string theory is correct and 
theory applies to the early universe it could very well be that just too difficult for any human being 
work through all these alternative geometries in ten dimensions etcetera which you know far more about than me it 
just be too difficult but on the other hand just as a computer learn to play worldclass chess in 
hours given just the rules then it could very well be that a machine could do the relevant manipulations 
calculations in order to follow through the consequences of a specific string theory mr and the varieties of string 
and of course if it turns out that at the end it spewed out the right mass of the 
things like that then we know on the right lines and this may be a kind of scientific discovery 
it never gives any human an insight because just too complicated but nonetheless we would know that it was 
a correct theory and so i think we have to bear in mind as there may be some theories 
are correct but we can never sort of have the insight into them which we hope to have into 
theories of physics at the present time simply because too complicated but nonetheless we would have confidence in them 
it would do a calculation and it will come out with something you could compare with experiment for numbers 
neutrinos masses etcetera mr and if we had such a theory we will then believe its predictions about the 
big bang because those things are supposed to apply to the conditions early on and so we would have 
to be able to decide whether many big bangs are not one what were they like and all that 
so i think this is just an example of how in science the capability of machine to do very 
complicated manipulations of ten dimensions of geometry which i think is a less remote goal than understanding human behavior 
kind of thing computer could be good at and that could be very very important for science the extreme 
of physics that we are interested in ourselves but also developing in terms of high tc superconductors and drugs 
all that so i think the power of ai to do not just routine computations but to explore parameter 
and learn is going to be very powerful and beneficial sc been a while now since the four color 
was proven i remember vividly mr right but an example of that sc an example of the computer doing 
and essentially mr but there again we knew what it was doing i think in the case of string 
we may not understand what doing just like in some of the very clever moves that the alphago zero 
playing go the experts understand how it chose that move and i think it maybe more like that i 
in the four color theorem everyone knew exactly what the program is doing etcetera whereas this might be qualitatively 
from that in that we really understand going on and of course this is a problem with ai already 
if decisions about whether you should be let out of prison whether you deserve credit or whether you need 
operation if made by machine then a bit worried about that even if you have evidence the machine on 
whole makes better more reliable judgments on human you feel entitled to an explanation you can understand but of 
not always the case when computers are now used and it may never be the case if used to 
these very difficult scientific problems which involve a huge amount of calculation sc yeah a whole regime in which 
can imagine computers solving problems and then not being able to tell us why they got the solution that 
did then scientifically that would seem to be not really satisfying in some way like we would think is 
work to be done all we had mr well right because obviously satisfaction science is having some idea and 
you get the insight when you realize just got to be that way and the most exciting thing that 
to you if a scientist but we would never have that but nonetheless if it spews out the correct 
for the fundamental constants and things like that then have to accept that really got some insights sc what 
your feelings about uploading a human brain into a computer mr well i mean is it ever going to 
feasible i know but then of course the question is would it really be you sc yes fine mr 
i think our personality depends on our bodies and our interaction our sense organs so would it be you 
again what philosophers discusses if told this have been done are you happy to say well you could be 
there and what happens if several clones are made of you which is really you so i think there 
all kinds of fascinating philosophic conundrums which philosophers have talked about for a long time but of course maybe 
day they will be practical ethics if we can do things like that but i think we do need 
worry about whether possible and of course if we think a few centuries ahead then even without that human 
may have changed human beings and not evolving on the times gonna doing selection mr evolving much faster or 
could do but through these techniques and one other point i make in my book is that when we 
the literature left by the greeks and romans then we can appreciate it because human nature was the same 
so we have some affinity with the emotions of those ancient artists and writers whereas a few hundred years 
now any intelligence is if its still around may have no more than an algorithmic understanding of us because 
may be fitted different that they have anything that we would call human emotions and human nature so going 
be a real gamechanger but that could happen over a few centuries sc because of humanmachine interfaces or mr 
interfaces or drastic genetic modification and human enhancement which you were talking about sc do you think that also 
is a frontier that might change things dramatically if that happens mr yes indeed yes and it could and 
course people are working on this as you know some people think that aging is a disease that can 
cured some people think just incremental improvements but of course if aging can be slowed down so that people 
to be two hundred this of course would be a huge sociological change and again if this was available 
only some subset of people this would be a huge and fundamental inequality and the question is what will 
with your multigenerational families or would you delay the menopause and all that be crucially different and so have 
be very worried about what would happen if changes of that kind were possible but again we exclude them 
think and of course we know the people like mr ray kurzweil who think that be immortal either by 
way all by being able to download them and there would be people who want to have their bodies 
in order that they can be resurrected when this happens and sc given all the existential risk that we 
talked about that seem like the best strategy to me mr no but in fact amused that three people 
know got to say from oxford not from my university have paid good money sc they signed up mr 
be frozen by this company in arizona sc okay mr i think eighty thousand dollars a cutprice if just 
head being frozen and and they hope this company will keep going for few centuries and then they can 
revived and of course got to have their blood replaced by liquid nitrogen etcetera and they go around carrying 
medallion so that people know to be done as soon as they drop dead sc to be saved mr 
so i think great i also think actually selfish because supposing that this worked then be revived into a 
different world be refugees from the past and be a burden we feel that got to look after refugees 
some people from amazonian tribes whose habitat has been destroyed but if these people voluntarily as refugees from the 
impose a burden on you then maybe they can put you in a zoo or something like that not 
that an ethical thing to do sc i think on your side but for purposes of playing advocate here 
similar calculation that we do with the existential risks if you thought that there is a of chance that 
hundred years from now we cure aging and you could literally live forever then clearly the benefit to you 
being frozen even if it work very well is almost infinite right definitely a calculation that ends up with 
conclusion you should do everything you can to try to preserve yourself mr yeah yes yes and the chance 
zero if you do this sc right right so what about then as another survival strategy going into space 
know that elon musk has said that one of his motivations for spacex is to back up the biosphere 
making sure we have some of us on other planets if something goes dramatically wrong here on earth is 
a good survival strategy for the human race mr well be skeptical about these arguments i mean of course 
interested in space being an astronomer and i think ai and miniaturization is going to be crucially important for 
science of space exploration i think been wonderful probes sent into space cassini orbiting around saturn its movements and 
that and new horizon which took pictures of pluto and all that but all those were technology probably so 
took ten years to build and and ten years to get there and if we think of how things 
smart phones have changed since then we realize how much better we can do now and so i really 
that be swarms of miniaturized probes going throughout the solar system to explore it in detail i think realistic 
also wandering around on the surface of mars etcetera mr but as it regards people then with every advance 
miniaturization of robotics the practical need for the people gets less and one reason why of course space flight 
not been prioritized so much of course there is a revival of interest and i personally think that if 
was an american i want any money to go on manned program because no practical need for the people 
on the other hand be glad that mr musk and the others are developing very effective rockets bringing the 
valley culture to a branch of industry that was dominated by the big conglomerates like lockheed and doing great 
there and i hope that they will be sending people into space but there will be adventurers prepared to 
a high risk because one reason why the nasa manned program is very expensive was it was very riskaverse 
shuttle was launched i think one hundred thirtyfive times and there were two failures less than failure rate but 
of those failures was a big national trauma because it was presented as safe and they sent up a 
school teacher and all that so i personally think that space should be left for adventurers the kind of 
who hang glide in yosemite and things like that and are prepared to accept a very high risk sc 
the risk is just cost of doing business and built in mr yeah yeah and there are people obviously 
who are prepared take that risk and even a oneway ticket to go to mars and but elon musk 
said he hopes die on mars but not on impact and good luck to him and we should admire 
people and cheer them on but i think the idea of mass immigration is a rather dangerous delusion because 
to realize that dealing with climate change for instance is a challenge but a doddle compared to terraforming mars 
so i think got to accept that no planet b for ordinary riskaverse people and so we should encourage 
to go to mars but less comfortable than living at the south pole and not many people want to 
that so i think we should encourage it and i think actually looking further ahead i think we should 
on those who do try to establish a colony on mars even though be against the odds uncomfortable and 
those people will have every incentive to use all the techniques of genetic modification and cyborg techniques to adapt 
pretty well adapted to living on the earth but be in an environment to which very badly adapted so 
every incentive to use these techniques to adapt to different gravity to different atmosphere etcetera mr and maybe if 
to download themselves into some electronic form and if they do that then they may prefer zero g and 
may not need to be on the planet at all so i think that these posthuman developments which will 
on a technological timescale far faster than the dominion time scale they will happen fastest among these crazy adventurers 
try to live on mars and so the posthuman era will start from them sc it does seem almost 
that the first trip to mars will be a oneway trip so hard to come back and that is 
good argument that it be done by a government right mr right right sc nasa would never send astronauts 
mars not to bring them back mr there could be lots of volunteers to go one way yeah sc 
but the government would be having a hard time mr and of course i think as human beings we 
admire and cheer on these people because then they may indeed hold the posthuman future in their hands sc 
i guess i thought of the idea that people who dwell in space whether on mars or inbetween would 
natural candidates for genetic modification but it makes perfect sense so in some sense a different species out there 
indeed become a different species yes and of course whether they would be entirely flesh and blood or whether 
will by then be cyborgs or even downloads into something electronic we know but if they become purely electronic 
of course they want to stay on a planet and of course if near immortal then interstellar voyage is 
deterrent to them and so they will spread and this has a relevance in my view to seti projects 
yeah i think obviously the search for extraterrestrial biospheres is a mainstream part of science now that we know 
are exoplanets out there many like the earth and within ten or twenty years know if any of them 
biospheres but of course what people really want to know is are there really any intelligent aliens out there 
why there are these seti programs to look for extraterrestrial artifacts or transmissions which are manifestly artificial and an 
for modest expenditures on all these possible searches because a fascinating to all of us mr but if you 
what i predict i particularly if anything is detected it be any sort of flesh and blood civilization on 
planet it will be some sort of maybe burping and malfunctioning artifact probably roaming in space and the reason 
that is suppose that there was another planet where things are rather like on the earth and happened here 
earth is four billion years of darwinian evolution and now in a few millenia of technological civilization but within 
few hundred years as discussed it may have been taken over by some sort of electronic entities not flesh 
blood and they in principle have a billion year future ahead of them for example they may be immortal 
they can create copies or developments of themselves etcetera and so if there was another planet where things have 
differently unlikely to be synchronized to within a few millennia so that we would detect a civilization like ours 
not in the same stage of technological development mr no so if behind by a few tens of millions 
years then of course we see no evidence of intelligence we see a biosphere if ahead then of course 
would not detect anything like now on earth but we might detect some technological artifacts or their emissions and 
why if we do detect something far more likely to be something like that some electronic artifact sc yeah 
personally think that the mr and you have to modify the drake equation because the drake equation talks about 
lifetime of civilization thinking of something with lots of independent flesh and blood entities whereas it may be one 
brain and may be something entirely electronic and that could persist for billions of years even if a civilization 
ours persist for more than a thousand years sc often thought that the idea of taking a big radio 
and listening in on the sky for other advanced civilizations was a very very very long shot because why 
the world would advanced civilization waste a bunch of energy beaming radio signals in random directions mr yes yes 
i think you know sensible to do everything we can as a byproduct sc relatively cheap mr yes and 
may support their efforts to look the radio transmissions narrow frequencies and look for optical flashes and things like 
and we should also look for artifacts we should look for evidence of some star orbited by something beneficially 
we should even look for artifacts in our solar system or something in the asteroid belt especially shiny etcetera 
on the moon mr on the moon yes indeed sc i mean one argument is that if intelligent life 
frequently it would build selfreplicating robots and it should have filled the galaxy a long time ago right and 
speaks to the fermi paradox mr yes well of course the fem paro is one important relevant fact about 
but i think a reason why i think a watertight argument is that if these future entities are electronic 
clear they will be expansionists because we have evolved by darwinian selection which favors intelligence but also favors aggression 
so why people talk about a sphere expanding and etcetera and the few aliens that have come here but 
the intelligences are electronic then they may be entirely conjugative they may not want to expand and so they 
be out there without manifesting their presence in any conspicuous way and come here so i think we can 
that the galaxy contain anythings like that we can say that it contain many civilizations which have led to 
expansion because we some what have got here already but i think if the scenario is that advanced intelligence 
electronic then that need not be associated with expansionism sc the flip side of that though is wondered about 
out loud is it possible that we do sort of gradually or suddenly upload our consciousness into electronics and 
exactly because we have all these sort of thermodynamics survival instincts anymore we stop caring even forget about expanding 
existing is less interesting to us in that environment the survival instinct is no longer there mr i think 
as human beings probably want to stay as human beings and i think like to feel that the earth 
very much why happy about all these things happening fast away from the earth but preserving the earth as 
is occupied by creatures who are adapted to it make a better go of it than making now sc 
in addition to human beings there would be artificial intelligent electronic beings that we could get spread throughout the 
mr yes and we hope leave us alone sc got it mr but i think we would want to 
and restrain the speed of these changes because maybe we because maybe some group will get ahead and have 
sort of very disturbed world where human beings survive this is one of the dystopian scenarios obviously but i 
we should hope that things change too fast sc your perspective seems to indicate that the fermi paradox might 
be a very big paradox and in fact that the galaxy might be teaming with different kinds of life 
that fair mr yes yes yes sc and so what does that say to people who are thinking about 
origin of life or the frequency of life i know that certainly an idea that we seen lots of 
yet therefore the very beginning of life was a really really really unlikely event or the beginning of multicellular 
was very hard mr yes well of course if you take the femher seriously then you could still be 
with the idea that simple life and the biosphere and lots of plans and things could be wide spread 
twenty years we will know that because have a spectroscopy of planets around nearby stars which will be sufficient 
tell us if a biosphere there but even if a biosphere of plants and simple organisms is common on 
planets throughout the galaxy it could still be that there are other bottlenecks which stop at getting to intelligence 
think we can still hope even if we think that intelligent life is widespread that simple biospheres are widespread 
we know what the odds were against the evolution getting as far as it has if the dinosaurs been 
out would there be an intelligence like us that emerged by a different group we just know sc well 
or titan might have biospheres right sc well titan might and of course the origin of life is a 
which everyone has known is an important problem but most people most serious scientists have put it in this 
of too difficult box and worked on it evidence of that is that the millerurey experiment done near where 
put sparks through gas and got amino acids and all that that experiment was still talked about forty years 
no one thought of doing much better experiments whereas now a lot of serious top ranking biologists who are 
about the origin of life and the stages by which it could happen as motivated by advances in microbiology 
also of course motivated by realizing that there are other places in the galaxy where it could exist and 
hopeful from having talked to a number of these people that we will have a plausible scenario for the 
of life within ten or twenty years and that will tell us two things tell us first was it 
rare fluke but it would tell us also in answer to your question does it depend completely on special 
like dna rna does it even depend on water as a solvent because on titan of course have to 
methane and not water mr i think if we understood the origins of life we would know whether whatever 
at the temperature of the earth with water could have happened on titan or not so we will know 
rare the origin of life is and what the variety of chemistries is that could lead to it we 
that but i think in the next twenty years know about that and we also might have evidence for 
there is life and of course telescopes now really powerful enough to be able to detect spectrum of a 
because an earthlike planet is billions of tiny things and the star it is orbiting and to isolate the 
that is very hard i think the james webb telescope might do something but after that the best bet 
going to be the telescope the europeans are building which is called the extremely large telescope sc run out 
good names mr we are unimaginative in nomenclature but this has a mirror which is not one sheet of 
but a mosaic of eight hundred pieces of glass and this will collect enough light such that with the 
spectograph it should be able to separate out the light reflected from the planet from the billions time brighter 
from the star sc so we can really see the biosphere mr and as the in different phases then 
would change that that would tell us something about the chlorophyll on the planet and things of that kind 
something which will be done within ten or twenty years sc yeah just so everyone knows the extremely large 
is a groundbased telescope right not satellite mr ground based yes yes james webb is in space and obviously 
advantage in space but you can have a much bigger mirror on the ground but incidentally if you look 
ahead then talk about robots even if we send many people into space we can have robotic fabricators assembling 
structures either on the moon or maybe in space and i think one exciting scenario is fabricating one huge 
lightweight mirror under zero g in space which might even be able to resolve the image of an exoplanet 
okay mr not to take the light and see it but see it as an extended object not as 
point i think make a point in my book that the target for this should be which is a 
the famous picture taken by bill anders earthrise which was the classic iconic picture of the earth and it 
be nice if after one hundred years after that we had a picture which we could post on our 
of an earthlike planet elsewhere and it would not be crazy to have by that time a successor of 
webb telescope and of the elt which could be a huge mirror up in space sc how huge is 
mr sorry sc how big do you need for the mirror up in space to do this mr i 
several hundred meters sc several hundred meters okay that sounds feasible to me what do i know but yeah 
but under it would not be impossible sc right okay you mentioned just to start winding things up we 
get back to the ethical concerns a little bit you did mention terraforming mars if human beings wanna go 
there and start living there there are people who will say that we do that this is a whole 
of nature and what do you think mr well i think if there were evidence of life there then 
think most people would feel we ought to preserve that life like a national park as it were if 
life at all then i think we could be somewhat more relaxed about it similarly like the moon i 
people talk about mining the moon in fact harrison schmitt has this idea of really doing a huge amount 
open cast mining on the moon to find helium three and i think economically that make much sense and 
never will but on the other hand the question is would we be relaxed about it and i personally 
be fairly relaxed about getting materials from the moon in order to build structures on the moon preserving a 
historic sites like where the apollo astronauts landed and things of that kind mr but if there were a 
already then i think most people would feel that one should try and preserve it on mars or indeed 
the ice of enceladus or europa which of course are now thought to be perhaps the most likely places 
life in our solar system and of course there are probes already being planned to fly through the spray 
up through cracks in the ice there to be able to do some analysis to see if complex chemistry 
and of course looking further ahead to send some submarine to go down and see if something swimming around 
there sc so mindscape listeners should know we will be talking about exactly that yeah a very exciting upcoming 
mr but i think the reason important well not there are observer important exploration but of course if we 
find evidence that life had originated twice independently within our solar system that would tell us straight away that 
of some kind was widespread in billion places in our galaxy sc it would be one of the most 
discoveries of all time mr it would it would indeed but got to be convincingly independent and why some 
would say on mars would not be quite so because people have said maybe all martians maybe life started 
mars and then meteorites brought it to the earth sc or vice versa mr yes whereas if it was 
europa i think you make that argument would be independent and of course if it was quite different chemistries 
the chemistry was very different right yeah mr and that also would show independence and so why i think 
for even rather boring primitive life anywhere in our solar system are very important because it would have such 
implications for the prevalence of life throughout the entire galaxy sc made bets before what would be your bet 
both the existence of life elsewhere and our likelihood of finding it mr well i think i would bet 
odds on finding evidence somewhere of life whether it will be in europa or enceladus moons of saturn or 
or whether it will be from observations of exoplanets like the earth and of course we just look at 
like the earth we should i think look at other planets in other places so i think not a 
expectation whereas the idea of finding intelligent life or artifacts which are evidence that there was some sort of 
life obviously in favor of pursuing searches at a modest level because so fascinating to everyone if people know 
astronomer then the first question they ask is we etcetra they all ask that question and they want to 
about it if you want to talk to your neighbor on a plane you say a mathematician sc r 
physicist physicist works mr yes but even though i favor and support modest searches for intelligent signals of some 
or artifacts i bet very much on that but so important it is worth the search sc yeah a 
point close by mentioning i know if ever told you this but some time ago roughly twenty years ago 
gave a public lecture in chicago and i was in the audience and so i was already a cosmologist 
giving lectures myself but you were talking about cosmology and the state of cosmology and in the middle of 
talk you started talking about the possibility of life on other planets in other solar systems and as a 
scientist of course i was appalled by this like not cosmology at laughter sc but i realized of course 
you just said that is what people care about and upon reflection i gathered a important lesson from that 
is that okay to talk about what people care about and not just what you as a professional are 
to be talking about mr yeah yeah yes yes but i think more than that i think there are 
subjects which are so far from any kind of empirical test that not worth discussing them and that should 
left in the too difficult box and left alone and that may have been true in the past of 
of these issues but i think exobiology is now a serious subject and so i think no one would 
it as a crazy flaky cranky subject as they might have done in the past sc right and the 
practice of contemplating the future seems to be a very different thing now than it was fifty years ago 
interesting to see how our perspective has changed mr it has but i think that when asked is there 
special perspective that i bring to these issues of the future because an astronomer and cosmologist it is simply 
awareness of the longterm future because most people unless they live in kentucky or some muslim areas are happy 
the idea the outcome of four billion years of evolution but nonetheless very many think we are the top 
the tree the culmination of the evolution sc the culmination mr and i think something which no astronomer could 
being aware of the huge ranges of future time and extended space sc a very good perspective to keep 
mind martin rees thanks so much for being on the podcast mr thank you very much music not sure 
by the thought there are of the nuclear weapons there were ready for launch at the height of the 
war that number is surely still enough for a civilization ending nuclear exchange thanks for this podcast one of 
favorites excelente frustrada quando leitura vosso diálogo terminou obrigada sean carroll por nos proporcionar episódios tão interessantes especialmente este 
sr martin rees é incrível not sure comforted by the thought there are of the nuclear weapons there were 
for launch at the height of the cold war that number is surely still enough for a civilization ending 
no that would not end civilization although it would be a very bad hair day on planet earth the 
public greatly exaggerates the destructive force of nuclear weapons but of course they do level cities a statistician who 
these things backed this up last year on an econ blog there would be a very small percentage of 
due to radiation since the effects from the blast are strong where the radiation is also the strongest nature 
had an article summarizing studies on nuclear winter over the past few decades and the trend has been toward 
weak nuclear winter or none at all nuclear war climate change and asteroids none big enough are around for 
least the next years end civilization it would have to be something as yet unknown the end due to 
explosion in paperclips would be pretty comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers
