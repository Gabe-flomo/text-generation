a lot on the podcast about the idea of thinking and consciousness what is it that is going on 
our heads inside our brains that makes us a conscious living being of course a lot of what we 
about consciousness is first person we know about our own consciousness from thinking about going on inside our heads 
do we know about how other people are doing their thinking sc well of course you need to be 
to communicate you can observe people and just sort of be completely scientific about it but most of our 
with the thoughts of other people comes from talking to them reading them talking about them and so forth 
to facilitate this kind of communication human beings invented language a symbolic system that lets us represent things and 
talk about them sc then very natural to ask how much is the way that we think influenced by 
language when we make different choices about how language should work those choices can then affect how we actually 
our thinking there was an idea called the sapirwhorf hypothesis back in the early days of the century the 
version of it said that language actually determines how we think you think in ways other than the ways 
language gives you no one really believes that anymore but a weaker version that says that language influences how 
think and a growing number of psychologists actually believe that sc guest is lera boroditsky who is a neuroscientist 
psychologist associate professor of cognitive science at uc san diego and i got to know her because in her 
on neuroscience and psychology and language she talks a lot about time time is one of my favorite things 
we end up at the same conferences but the point is when we talk about time interestingly we very 
use spatial metaphors we talk about moving the meeting forward what is that supposed to mean how do you 
a thing in time forward or backwards does moving something forward an hour mean an hour earlier or an 
later well that depends on whether you metaphorically think of yourself as moving forward in time or the meeting 
moving toward you as you stay stationary neither one of those ideas is correct or incorrect just metaphorical choices 
relate a spatial picture to the time language that we use sc so lera has studied how different cultures 
language particularly when you talk about time but in other ways as well and figure out that not everyone 
just simple forward backward language there are cultures and languages that relate time to up and down cultures and 
that relate it to what compass direction pointing in or where the big mountain on your island is this 
of stuff illuminates how we think about the world in very interesting ways you have a long way to 
to figure it out but research is a wonderful window onto the weird ways in which we without even 
it shape the way that we think sc i wanted to mention that i do have a little project 
thinking of maybe trying to start namely doing a little set of youtube videos about big ideas in physics 
sort of a way to get through the coronavirus epidemic pandemic that kind of all facing not really very 
but something to do something to give me a sense of contributing some way i know a lot of 
are at home a lot of people are worried maybe we can have some videos talk about how the 
works maybe that will be a fun thing to do so look for that links to that on my 
feed and webpage and so forth sc what i hopefully will be doing is releasing short videos and then 
couple of days later doing also short questionandanswer sessions where after the first video is released you leave some 
on youtube or on twitter and then try to answer some of the best ones so see how that 
i hope everyone is staying safe washing your hands social distancing all those things that we need to do 
delicate balance that we have to strike we have to be careful we have to take care of ourselves 
we have to think about the welfare of others but we also have to not panic and we also 
to keep living our lives and not at all obvious how to do that i hope all doing it 
best we can so with that go music sc lera boroditsky welcome to mindscape podcast lera boroditsky thanks for 
me sc so i am a physicist i think about space and time but time probably my favorite dimension 
space time i wrote a book about time but from a physics point of view one of the little 
that i got was that the word time is the most used noun in the english language lb it 
yeah this is sometimes reported as news but been true for hundreds of years but actually also very commonly 
in lots of other indoeuropean languages so words like time are in the top ten across lots and lots 
languages we seem to be obsessed with it sc is it less true in in nonindoeuropean languages lb i 
checked sc okay you just checked lb there are languages sc yeah you look through all of them a 
little phd project lb but we use the word time in many different ways in english so a bit 
a cheat to say the most frequently used word so because we can say how much time do you 
or how many times have you seen it or time after time sc time for this yeah lb or 
you another time all of those are actually different uses of the word time or you can even say 
me in which case using it as a verb so a bit of a cheat but still talking about 
a lot sc well it because a lot of people think that time is somehow mysterious and certainly able 
use it able to capture it we know what we mean when we say be at the seminar at 
pm or something like that that operationalizes very straightforwardly into the world lb well created conventions that we require 
other to follow but those conventions actually that important in a lot of other places so if living in 
village in the jungle making an appointment for tuesday for example is not that useful unless something happens in 
life on a regular sevenday schedule and actually tuesdays are in some important conventional way different from other days 
not then the sevenday week is a completely arbitrary imposition on the flow of time in fact lots of 
cultures have different week structures that they follow sc well this i really want to get into this about 
interplay of the language that we use and the reality that we perceive around it but first you have 
these wonderful examples of the relationship between spatial metaphors and our use of time so why we just start 
a classic question of move next meeting forward lb yeah so if you ask people next meeting has been 
forward two days what day is the meeting now that been rescheduled people often have a very strong intuition 
what the answer is but about half the people think that monday and about half the people think that 
the reason is we can talk about time two different ways in english we can talk about ourselves as 
in time so we can say things like approaching the deadline coming up on the holidays moving across a 
path which is time from the past to the future or we can talk about time as moving so 
deadline is coming up the holidays are approaching so stationary and time events and time are moving towards us 
are two different perspectives lb so if thinking of yourself as moving in time then the meeting moves forward 
your direction of motion from wednesday to friday but if thinking about time moving towards you then forward is 
the direction of motion of time from wednesday to monday what we find actually is getting people to think 
themselves moving in space like scooting in a chair to a goal or something coming towards them like bringing 
chair to them using a rope something like that that will change the perspective that they take on time 
if thinking about yourself moving through space say the meeting is on friday sc so you prime them in 
sense by making them think about this lb yeah we get them to imagine one spatial scenario or another 
when imagining themselves moving in space they get the seemingly unrelated question about next meeting and it changes their 
about the meeting because the way we think about space and time are so closely related sc the is 
have other examples get to about how people in different languages or different cultures think about it but this 
the same culture the same set of people using the same words and still almost equally split are there 
between personality types do nervous people think of it one way and relaxed people think of it the other 
lb people have tried looking for personality correlations and there have been some small studies i think want to 
larger samples to really be sure but what we find is that even though people might have an original 
if you prime them they have an original intuition that either monday or friday you can get a whole 
of people to switch sc pretty loose not deeply ingrained lb yeah and just that that use of the 
forward is ambiguous in english just like most other words are ambiguous just in this case you can get 
to be ambiguous to mean one thing or the opposite of that thing sc and presumably all completely unconscious 
even using that as a spatial metaphor we just use the word and people think they know what it 
lb yeah and almost impossible in english to talk about time without using spatial words so for example if 
want to talk about duration in english no word like duratious sc long lb yeah you say long or 
say how much time did it take so you talk about amount you talk about distance other languages might 
dedicated words that you use only for duration not for distance but in english almost impossible to talk about 
with time without using words that were originally spatial so you might say see you at on tuesday in 
hour sc interesting because most lb those are spatial prepositions sc yeah most people sort of think that the 
realization that space and time are part of the same thing was this big counterintuitive thing but they were 
at least metaphorically related to us lb the way that we think about lots of abstract things that we 
is often spatial so we kind of use our visual spatial abilities to allow us to imagine and organize 
lot of other things that are abstract so whether talking about stocks or prices going up and down or 
going up and down there are lots of things that are kind of nebulous or not directly perceivable by 
senses that we just map into space and it makes it seem like we can handle it then in 
minds and manipulate it and think about it more easily sc this is probably already hinting at some relationship 
how the brain works and how we develop these things i did a wonderful podcast with lynne kelly about 
palaces building these little structures that have interesting shapes and they let you remember things so again analogizing things 
space to things you want to remember makes it much easier lb yeah we do have a lot of 
for organizing things in space we have a lot of experience of navigating spaces in our actual lives in 
actual physical experience and so then we can draw on that to reason about lots and lots of other 
sc are we allowed to say that maybe the spatial capacities evolved first before we had a nuanced grasp 
time and other things lb i know that that would be the case i think a lot of modern 
on neuroscience shows that there are cells that mark locations in space time that the things that we used 
think were spatial cells are really more like context sc yeah okay good lb and sc we were at 
meeting together about this very idea right lb yes sc yeah neurons and space time yeah lb so certainly 
of even extremely primitive organisms need to do timing in order to perform even the most basic motor action 
have to be able to time things you have to move one thing and then the other so certainly 
basic senses of time exist throughout the evolutionary tree the way that we end up thinking about time once 
start thinking about the deep past or thinking about moving events and things like that that of course starts 
starts leveraging a very different system but even within the human mind how we do timing is really distributed 
the brain so if doing millisecond timing for motor movement a lot of that is going to be in 
cerebellum at the back of your brain but if thinking about something on an order of a second or 
than thirty milliseconds or more than yeah more than thirty milliseconds going to be a little bit further forward 
the brain if something like a minute going to be the frontal cortex sc i know that okay so 
that clearly sort of monotonically related lb not that monotonically related just really different functions keeping track of a 
is a really different task than controlling your fingers to play the piano even though we would call them 
timing there is sc use different parts of the brain lb the mechanisms are totally different for doing those 
sc and you have this wonderful set of examples about how the spatial metaphors and time are different in 
cultures so a range a set of things in duration and i guess when they lb in order yeah 
and that relates to how you read and things like that lb there are lots of cultural practices that 
how we correlate space and time so reading direction certainly makes a difference so if you read from left 
right likely to think that earlier things are on the left and later things are on the right and 
if i give you a set of pictures of someone at different ages for example likely to put the 
pictures on the left and the oldest pictures on the right sc right lb but if i give the 
test to someone who reads from right to left like arabic or hebrew then likely to put the earliest 
on the right and the latest pictures on the left so the way that we scan the world and 
events in our minds is set by this very simple convention of which direction your language is written sc 
lb and even just the way you imagine an event unfolding so for example if i ask you imagine 
is giving flowers to mary draw me a picture of that if you ask an english speaker to do 
likely to put bill on the left and mary on the right the action is going from left to 
but if you ask an arabic speaker to do that likely to put bill on the right and mary 
the left so imagining quote unquote the same event but unfolding in these different directions depending on their practice 
and writing sc and that must be just some arbitrary accident of history who chose what left to right 
right to left lb a little bit less than arbitrary it had to do with what kinds of writing 
you had and how sc oh okay chuckle lb smudging you would have depending on what you were using 
write with or if you were using a hammer and chisel for example you would hold the hammer in 
dominant hand the chisel in your less dominant hand as opposed to if writing with ink going to use 
dominant hand because most people are righthanded it makes more sense to go in one direction with some implements 
in the other direction with the other implements so depending on when your writing system was being developed and 
have switched directions when the implements changed sc yeah i remember thinking when i first heard about this stuff 
just within physics there are subfields within physics that draw pictures in their papers of how time is flowing 
never from right to left but frequently from left to right from top to bottom or from bottom to 
cosmologists and people who do relativity time flows upward but computer scientists time flows downward and i really know 
chuckle not because we use different implements or anything like that so it is interesting and different cultures have 
and down also metaphors for time lb yeah so in mandarin for example there is a strong updown metaphor 
earlier events are above later events are below sc earlier is above lb the past is up sc time 
down lb well chuckle the past is up sc the past is up alright lb the future is down 
a simpler way if saying it yeah lb i know are you moving it time moving sc right okay 
know lb we have to set that also right sc right yeah lb so if we think of ourselves 
stationary then you would say that time is moving events and time are flowing up so that earlier things 
up further and further up above you sc okay right lb but the way you would use the metaphors 
mandarin would be for example to say the last month you would say the up month and the next 
is the down month and what seen in a lot of studies is that mandarin speakers actually do use 
organization in their minds privately when organizing events in time sc how do you test something like that lb 
you can do it in lots of ways tell you the simplest one which is i can stand next 
you and i point to a spot in front of your body and say i told you this here 
today where would you put yesterday and where would you put and then you just have to point somewhere 
space and when you do that english speakers will almost always organize things from left to right so put 
on the left and tomorrow on the right whereas mandarin speakers will often organize things vertically putting yesterday above 
tomorrow below you can also see that in spontaneous gestures so just get people talking about time and start 
their hands we like to use our hands when we talk chuckle sc yeah lb and so you can 
that and you can also set up little experiments where you require people to push a button that means 
or later and you are very meanly either placing that button above or below the start button and you 
which one is harder for people so if they have already in their minds an implicit association that up 
earlier it should take them longer to respond when very meanly placed the button in the wrong place and 
you can measure that across lots of cultures sc this is a technique right in psychology so i know 
lot about it of figuring out things that people even know about themselves by figuring out how long it 
them to do something is how reliable is this how good is this or is it perfectly established lb 
the technique describing would broadly be a test of implicit associations so asking what implicit associations do people already 
and whatever is automatic or whatever is very ready for you to do is going to be easier to 
going to be able to do that task faster and so often we set up exactly the kind of 
i described where you say well would it be stressful or difficult for you if i arrange things in 
way different from the norm and so for english speakers for example it matter for them if i put 
earlier key above or below they have a strong association that goes either way whereas for mandarin speakers faster 
above than if below and so that tells us that there is this implicit association that they have an 
that those things are associated that they have to override when i do it the wrong way for them 
right okay i just want to keep getting all these wonderful examples on the table you also have examples 
just the fact that we have the words past present future but some languages slice the baloney much more 
than that and some less i suppose lb yeah well the way that languages treat time grammatically are really 
so for example in some languages there is no past tense there is no future tense no tense marking 
at all in fact verbs never change sc there are verbs but not tensed lb yeah some people argue 
or not verbs but a different discussion yeah so the way you would say if i showed you a 
of someone who is about to kick the ball someone in the process of kicking the ball someone just 
the ball there are some languages where you would just say kick in all three cases sc ball kick 
yeah and then there are other languages that make much finer distinctions so in some languages there might be 
different past tenses depending on how long how long ago something occurred right so if it was within a 
one tense if within a month another tense and so on and so you really have to keep track 
how long ago something was and make sure you use the correct tense sc and does that affect how 
think about time are they better at knowing how long ago things were if they have those words available 
there been an empirical test of that language that i was just describing is this minority language spoken in 
new guinea so it would be quite challenging to do sc not that many test subjects yeah lb not 
but it would be really interesting to see in general the prediction would be that whenever you make a 
you see things that fall in the category together as being more similar and you see things that are 
different categories that fall on different sides of that the category boundary as being more different lb so if 
language makes a distinction between things that happen up to a week ago and other things then you really 
a separate category in your mind for things that have happened within the week and those are seen as 
from things that have happened within the month but not within the week sc and somehow in your brain 
keep changing categories as a week goes by weird to me lb yeah they have to continuously fade fade 
new categories yeah sc i this is probably an unfair question but do we know enough about how the 
works to say that these memories are in our brains but they get reclassified as they pass the boundary 
do we sort of have to think about oh that was three weeks ago so okay in this category 
well we know enough about the brain to know that i can make an educated guess which is that 
about to tell someone about an event retrieving elements and when retrieving adding information as well this is true 
any retrieval case right so if i ask you about a birthday party that you attended be able to 
some details that may be how you directly experienced but also going to fill in a lot of other 
from general knowledge that you have about birthday parties and what like at birthday parties and all kinds of 
general knowledge that you have and so in that context of retrieval that that information gets added or it 
reclassified sc so i guess we have this naive metaphor based on computers or something like that that images 
files have timestamps but probably memories are not quite that simplistic although clearly we do have some ability to 
when things happened but i know exactly how it works lb yeah well remembering context right so with every 
going to be context that you store away you might know that it must have happened before this because 
yet known about that or you might know that a particular person was there and you yet know that 
before such and such a time so you can often use context to try sc yeah interesting not that 
has a timestamp that one memory is sort of connected to all these other memories and we can reconstruct 
it must have been lb exactly but we certainly have a timestamp mostly terrible at remembering when things happen 
may be for the best not usually that important but imagine if you had an exact timestamp for every 
that occurred how fine grained would you want that like every time you picked up a fork laughter sc 
lb i think in general you kind of know the relationship between events in your life more or less 
do you think in general that the fact that so used to computers now has given us a bad 
of how the brain probably works they are pretty different lb so we do have a tendency to compare 
to whatever is the most complicated technology available at the time right so it used to be that the 
common metaphors for thinking were clay tablets right and then after clay tablets maybe it was the abacus and 
it was a calculator and then it was a telephone switchboard those were very complicated then it was the 
and maybe now the internet and so people draw on whatever complex things they have around to try to 
this other extremely complex thing sc yeah lb you see that in all branches of science right so in 
the atom used to be a ball and then it was a bowl of pudding with raisins in it 
lb and then it was a solar system sc right lb and a cloud sc now a cloud yeah 
and so you have these metaphors that drive hypotheses that drive thinking drive debate and always evolving sc and 
guess we just talk about spatial metaphors for time but even i want to say spatial metaphors for space 
people think about space could be very different how people think about directions in space for example lb yeah 
the way that we orient ourselves in space and which dimensions we think are primary really differs from culture 
culture so for example been talking a lot about left and right and you organize time from left to 
for example but there are some languages that really use words like left and right and instead they do 
in some kind of absolute space so cardinal directions would be an example north south east west i had 
chance to work in a culture like this in australia actually about a third of the languages rely strongly 
cardinal directions of some sort sc so as opposed to saying forward backward left right they say north south 
west lb not necessarily north south east west the set of directions could be different so it could be 
you live on a hill your directions are uphill downhill across the hill or it could be that your 
are set by the river that you live by or or set by the locations of the mouth and 
source of the river not the flow of the river sc things that are important to your life lb 
prevailing winds or they could just be an arbitrary set of directions that roughly divide things into quadrants but 
with north south east and west right so there are lots of possible systems on islands often a concentric 
where there is a direction seaward and a direction inland sc yeah lb like volcanoward is sc yeah typical 
lb is a direction and sometimes you have mixed systems like you might have a seaward inland dimension but 
an eastwest dimension and so people use both eastwest very common because of the sun of course and then 
also have this more concentric system about how far away you are from the sea sc and that does 
like that linguistic convention would have an effect on what you understand i mean right now i have no 
what direction north is right but if i grew up in that culture i would probably keep track of 
all the time lb yeah in fact what we find people who speak languages that require you to use 
directions for example do keep track of which way facing because you have to to speak the language right 
in the community i worked in literally to say you say way are you and the answer should be 
like north west in the far distance about right so you literally get past hello and the social pressure 
course to learn is very very strong you just get treated like a nincompoop if you and even very 
kids there are very welloriented so i could sit down with a fouryearold and say can you draw me 
south east and and they would just make these two effortless lines in the sand and i would get 
compass out and be blown away exactly right this tiny little human and like did you do sc yeah 
about people whose brains are not completely functional does that affect how they perceive these things lb we had 
chance to test this looking at patients had strokes we looked at patients with strokes in their right parietal 
this is a common place to have a stroke a lot of vasculature so common for things to go 
and when you have a stroke there one consequence often is that you start neglecting things that are on 
left side of space on the other side of space so these patients might only sc because your right 
sc covers your left perceptions lb yes so these patients might only eat food on the right set of 
plate or they might only put makeup on the right side of their face or might only shave the 
side of their face they might only read words on the right side of the page they just they 
to be unaware of happening on the left and so we wonder does this also extend to time so 
concretely is time really on the left or the right sc i mean sorry can i just ask for 
plate thing is there a part of their brain that knows that only seeing the righthand side and they 
just rotate their plate and more food there lb if you rotate it for them be happy and eat 
other side sc but they lb they they will eat food on the right side of the plate and 
complain that still hungry sc huh so something else going wrong in their brains that they lb just not 
to bring into consciousness things that sc okay not able to bring to consciousness lb that are on the 
which is amazing but yeah it does undermine the idea that a separate unified consciousness lb yeah so obviously 
brain is aware of lots of things that not telling you about kind of like on a needtoknow basis 
your conscious experience sc yeah yeah lb so if you really stress test this like if you have something 
fire on the left side or you show a salacious image on the left side people might sc your 
will let you know lb well they might sc okay react lb but might not know why blushing sc 
lb and yeah so we told people these were patients who read from left to write they were frenchspeaking 
in switzerland we told them about a guy david who liked doing some things ten years ago in the 
and will like doing different things ten years from now these are trivial things like ten years ago he 
cherries but ten years from now like strawberries and these are just facts that they had to remember and 
we found was when we tested their memory they were much more likely to remember things that were associated 
the future the right side of time and if they remembered things from the past they misattributed them to 
future so if they remembered something that we said happened ten years ago if they recognized it they mistakenly 
that it had to be in the future so they kind of squeezed everything in their mental timeline into 
part that they could attend to which is in the right part of their mental timeline lb so that 
me shows just how deeply ingrained these cultural patterns are right so culturally we have assigned the left side 
time to be the past and the right side of time to be the future a completely arbitrary convention 
arbitrary cultural convention and yet by the time grown adults if you destroy the part of the brain that 
the left side of space you also knock out that culturally associated part of time sc so somehow encoded 
the physical brain lb it is yeah lb in ways that learning lb yeah well no other option than 
things to be encoded in the physical brain we have any other hypotheses sc true fair enough where it 
lb but you can see it yeah sc alright very good lb you can see it yeah sc i 
maybe this is a digression but i want to hear more about what this fieldwork is like how do 
find this tribe with this language how do you visit them are they presumably a small tribe lb the 
linguistic community is about two hundred people the entire community is about five hundred people and there are speakers 
five different languages that live together in this community sc isolated or lb yeah pretty isolated they live on 
west coast of cape york on this town called pormpuraaw it was set up as a mission in australia 
to answer your question how do you kind of start on this kind of work well you always start 
a question or an interesting observation that catches you and you say i sc right yeah lb and so 
ended up doing this work with a wonderful collaborator alice gaby who was the first to describe the grammar 
the kuuk thaayorre language that was spoken here so she wrote the grammar for the language as her dissertation 
she spent a lot of time in the community and i got connected with alice because been bothering one 
her advisors for years about working with people who speak these languages that have this cool way of thinking 
space how do they think about time have you noticed anything have you noticed every time i would go 
visit his lab i would constantly bug him and after years he said you know what alice noticed something 
should go talk to sc the progress of science how it works yeah lb but then recently i was 
through some of my college notebooks and a very disorganized note taker and so my notebook contains some notes 
husserl and then phone number a recipe for lamb stew and then a note sc as they do yeah 
a note that said get in touch with such and such a person and find out how speakers of 
language organize time it would be cool it fits in cardinal directions and i have zero memory of writing 
note and then of course twenty years later you get to do the study but it was one of 
things where you just get interested in a question and you keep asking people who you think might know 
eventually an opportunity opens up and the gift of a wonderful collaborator and then you get to get to 
out the answer to the question that apparently wanted to know for much longer that i remembered sc yeah 
you have to learn the language lb no alice was my contact on the language front sc i mean 
many languages do you have to know to do your job is that a fair question lb really useful 
know about languages and really useful to have wonderful collaborators that you trust who are experts always best to 
someone who is more expert than you sc sure not going to be super fluent in all thousands of 
but okay so the answer does a says cardinal directions affect how you talk about time lb it affects 
people organize time in their mind so when we asked people in this community for example organize cards that 
a person aging from young to old instead of organizing them from left to right they organize them from 
to west so if sitting facing south they made them go from left to right but if sitting facing 
they made them go from right to left if sitting facing east they made them go coming towards their 
sc right lb and for me that was just the most amazing thing to see with my own eyes 
thing when you make a prediction theoretically you say a bold claim if i think that the way people 
about time depends on space and you build one out of the other then they should do this but 
thing never seen anyone do sc right no the scary part right falsifiable predictions lb and millions and millions 
people have been given a task to organize cards and never seen someone do it that way and so 
sit someone down and you say see what and then you see it happen before your eyes the coolest 
to see chuckle sc and in a sense very weird to us to think that i need to keep 
of north south east west when i put some cards on the floor but maybe a little bit less 
not like time revolves around you more stuck in here inherent in the earth somehow lb yeah definitely one 
of thinking about that pattern of data i just described that says how weird they make time go in 
directions depending on which way but actually the other way of describing it is no doing in a different 
frame so actually time always goes in the same direction in the coordinate frame important to so using a 
different set of coordinates and for them the relevant coordinates are east to west and time always goes from 
to west and me who is making the dimension of time chase me around every time i turned my 
extremely egocentric of me sc and is this is again maybe future research but are there other correlations so 
is a whole another category to think about both space and time a little bit differently can we match 
up to other ways they think lb there are lots of things that we would want to explore definitely 
early to make other conclusions but people have found lots of other cool patterns of how time goes that 
to right or right to left so for example my colleague here at ucsd rafael núñez and kensy cooperrider 
work in a community in papua new guinea the yupno people and cool about the yupno is for them 
go in a straight line so it rolls into the village at one angle and then it hits the 
it takes a turn and rolls out at a different angle sc okay just crazy talk sorry gone too 
lb well this is why telling you right sc yeah lb so because we have traditionally had all these 
about how time must go sc right lb so it used to be well it has to go from 
to right and maybe it has something to do with handedness because righthanded so people would have that kind 
explanation or it has to go so that the future is in front and the past is behind because 
walk forwards mostly and not backwards and we have eyes in the front of our heads and not the 
that turns out not to be true either the past for some people the past is in front the 
except for all these logical things yeah lb it has to be in a straight line of course how 
could it be but it have to be in a straight line if there are places around you that 
important to you so in this case the mouth and the source of the yupno river are really important 
and no way to make a straight line between them and hit the village so time takes a detour 
the village stops in the village and then takes a turn and goes sc what does that mean operationally 
when you say when referring to something a week ago in one direction and a year ago it was 
a different direction is lb yeah so if looking at the way people gesture as talking about events in 
past and the future see them gesturing along this bent timeline sc okay right more things in heaven and 
i guess yeah very cool lb but i think all of this is a testament to the incredible ingenuity 
the human mind that invented not one way of thinking about time but so many thousands of ways of 
about time and probably we invented most of the ones that are still possible sc at least all the 
you mentioned are onedimensional right i would be more troubled if people were thinking of time as twodimensional i 
how to make sense of that lb well so the example we started with when i say next meeting 
been moved forward two days what day is the meeting you tell me if you think more than onedimensional 
if people are giving me different answers depending on how thinking whether thinking about themselves moving or time moving 
now if time is onedimensional and like a onedimensional unidirectional entity then it should not matter if moving towards 
meeting or the meeting is moving towards me right those are the same thing in space it matters because 
fixed ground against which moving so if moving towards you different than you moving towards me because there are 
things that are staying stationary relative to us but that requires more dimensionality right sc oh i know i 
so i think that i mean number one of course part of what einstein figured out was that the 
perfectly okay to think of the ground as moving if on a train or something like that right so 
you can choose your reference frame as you want but even if space were only onedimensional there could still 
ground and there could still be a reference frame with respect to which you were at rest i think 
thing that is having space be more than onedimensional enables is that you can go in circles right whereas 
time you go in circles you only go in one direction lb well a lot of cultures do go 
circles sc so they think they linguistically talk about it that way lb well certainly people draw diagrams of 
that are circular or at least imply a spiral and we have a lot of cycles built into our 
right so we have the week cycle where things repeat and the months of the year repeat and so 
and in some cultures those circles are a lot more prominent as a way of thinking than in others 
yeah i know i mean the standard paradigmatic clock is a pendulum going back and forth right repeating itself 
and over again yeah no no there are definitely cycles in nature lb but in general i have described 
lot of things that sound linear and part of that might be an artifact of the measurement right so 
measuring how people think about time you give them some cards to lay out they give you a line 
when looking at a line possible that what looking at is a small part of a really big circle 
oh yeah oh yes very much lb right and just not making a measurement of the whole system so 
it was possible for us to create a task that measured a lot more of the space we just 
a bunch of little lines we would see a lot of lines that connect small lines that connect into 
circle sc sure lb or a rhombus or something right sc and talking about weeks and months and years 
presumably all these different cultures have their cosmologies or their eschatologies or whatever and so they might have guesses 
hypotheses about what happens on much much much longer timescales that are different from culture to culture right hindus 
a cyclic sort of cosmology that is like way longer than most western cosmologies as far lb yeah definitely 
to deep time whether the past or the future is really different from place to place give you two 
one is just how many steps of causation do you think are relevant to a current outcome so if 
set up a pool table and i say the location of all the balls going to make a shot 
important is this shot for all of the next shots that going to sc right okay the causality lb 
does it make an impact on the second one and the third one and the fourth one and if 
ask students in different countries this everyone will say the next shot of course is being affected by the 
of this first one but then people start to fall off and american students fall off after basically like 
second or third shot so by the time you make it to the fourth or fifth shot they say 
first shot is no longer exerting a lot of causal and but students in korea for example will say 
the sixth and the seventh shot they still think exerting a lot of causal force and going the same 
in the opposite direction in the past you say the location of the balls ended up now how important 
the shot before that the shot before that the shot before and again american students have a much narrower 
of time slice of causal links that they allow to be relevant whereas other people have a deeper causal 
that they allow to be built sc interesting as a physicist i can justify either one of those approaches 
i mean clearly the shot that you do right now in principle affects all the subsequent shots right but 
in practice enough unpredictability that it affect it in a noticeable way so i mean it depends on what 
care about right lb yeah so you said also about time being onedimensional as opposed to twodimensional in cycles 
i wanted to tell you about the balinese calendar such a cool example people describe balinese time as dense 
so instead of one sevenday week the balinese calendar has ten concurrently cycling weeks a oneday week a twoday 
a threeday week a fourday week a and so all of these are have their own rhythms right sc 
good for them lb and different things happen on different size weeks so for example the fish market might 
on the third and fifth day of a fiveday week the vegetable market might be on the fifth and 
day of a eightday week and so you can imagine the kind of complex rhythm that this creates in 
kind of understanding of time and also there are three concurrent years happening so like the gregorian calendar the 
calendar and the solar calendar and all of these are also happening at the same time so if you 
a chance to look at a balinese calendar and see all of the markings and designations and colors and 
markers that are required to keep track of all of these really phenomenal sc how did they do this 
they had laptops and things like that like i keep track of my appointments next week lb i think 
cultural practice that you see also for example in music in bali so if you think about gamelan and 
of the complex cycles of rhythm that happened on the gamelan where if playing one part of the gamelan 
might be on a i know eightyseven count sc okay lb where you hit on the thirtyone and the 
and someone else is on a much different set of times and so i think that idea of embedded 
that are recurring but are of different lengths and things kind of falling into that rhythm ever existing is 
a very important part of the culture that permeates lots sc that does sound like something that would i 
expect clearly have an impact on cognitive capacities right i bet the typical balinese person is better at juggling 
these rhythms than i ever would be trained to do it right they expect it and so forth lb 
you said than you ever would be well i would disagree with that i think if sc old and 
now i mean if started young then sure but now i know lb no you can learn lots of 
sc okay lb this idea that you learn things later in life is really silly sc okay i actually 
agree with you lb think about all the things complex things learned since you were six years old sc 
lb i think we have this somewhat magical idea that children are the sponges for information and they can 
these really complex things and sure children are sponges and they learn lots of things very impressive but adults 
pretty well we come up with some pretty clever stuff on team adults sc yeah no actually very glad 
you called me out on that because i am a big believer that you can and should try to 
things even in your dotage such as i am but okay still i do think that the practice does 
your capabilities yeah this lb oh absolutely sc yeah lb cultural practice especially something built into your language something 
are required to do you have to do it just in order to be a normal member of your 
going to do it and so a daily practice and if anything we know from cognitive psychology is the 
you practice you get better at sc yeah okay i mean i do want to think that we can 
learning things no matter how old we get maybe but i sometimes wonder whether just whistling dixie like what 
learning languages is it true that we were better at that when we were younger lb definitely easier to 
languages when younger than when older it gets progressively harder but people often use that as an excuse to 
learn another language i often have people tell me too late for me never if i start learning french 
never be perfect at it never be native and i always wonder like why do you want to be 
are you trying to be an international spy the only reason why need to be pass for a native 
actually really fun and useful to speak a language even if not perfect you could speak it pretty well 
do you do sort of discipline yourself to learn more languages occasionally is this part lb trying to learn 
now sc spanish okay good yeah lb i think super fun a fun puzzle where you can actually go 
and have an interaction with someone it feels like solved like unlocked some kind of mystery like you said 
words and they said some words back and you got the taco that you wanted and like achievement unlocked 
success yes lb it worked sc i actually think this more broadly about academics i think that this idea 
creative when young and we become less creative when older and maybe some of that that is true but 
equally good hypothesis that says when young we know anything so we have to work hard to learn and 
an expert in something and when older like already an expert in something so we can just keep doing 
thing over and over again and that makes us less creative completely irrespective of our cognitive capacities lb yeah 
we definitely get set in habits and we get set in patterns but once you recognize that about yourself 
can do something consciously about that right and you can go and learn new things you can go and 
new experiences this is one of the reasons that people travel for example you end up in a different 
and those times that travelling that away they expand in memory so you might have a week of vacation 
that week of vacation takes up so much more space in your memory of the year than the rest 
the year sc yeah yeah lb because you have new experiences in a different context they just automatic repetitions 
the your normal routine and so whether learning languages or having new experiences jostling yourself to do something new 
that opportunity for creativity sc so as a professional cognitive scientist would you sign on to the idea that 
surprising yourself and trying new things keeps you young in terms of your brain function lb there are definitely 
of studies that show that a use it or lose it feature true with languages so people who acquire 
second language are somewhat protected from and onset of dementia late in life but also true for any active 
that people keep up right so whether digital photography or something else that requires you to use your brain 
new creative ways that will help you stay active and i always tell people that the right time to 
other language is now laughter lb it does get harder as you get older but unless you have a 
machine and you could go back to when you were younger your only option is now and now is 
than any other time later sc i need to get some like language learning course to advertise on the 
feel good about that lb a great idea sc and not just time you have another example which speaks 
this point about colors about the light blue and dark blue lb yeah so a very simple example again 
language makes a distinction between two things it requires you to make a distinction between two things you get 
lot of practice distinguishing them so in russian there a single word that covers the entire spectrum of blues 
english so not a word that covers everything from the lightest blues to the darkest blues instead there is 
separate word for light blue goluboy and as another word for dark blue which is siniy and so russian 
have to call different shades of blue by these two different names and when you test their ability to 
blues that either fall in one russian category or in two different russian categories faster to tell the difference 
what they would call goluboy and what they would call siniy whereas for english speakers all just blue sc 
we can tell that different but it takes us longer to recognize the difference than it would a russian 
yeah in general this is true across languages you can test english speakers across the bluegreen distinction and things 
you would call blue as opposed to green colors that fall on either side of that boundary you will 
faster to tell the difference between than two different blues or two different greens that you would call by 
same name sc nothing spooky about that practice what used to doing lb practice sc yeah yeah i mean 
now bumping up against the big question which is how we talk versus what is real does language bring 
into existence or is it a simple representation of reality like i think even men and women even in 
united states label colors slightly differently right and certainly the evidence you just said russians and english speakers label 
slightly differently does that mean that we see differently are we perceiving the world differently and going to go 
beyond colors to much more deep and important concepts there lb yeah so of course all we can measure 
experiments is how people behave right so i can say does it take you longer to make this distinction 
not are you more likely to confuse these two colors in memory are you more likely to make an 
when asking you to make a distinction what i tell you from any of those results is what your 
of that color is right so if your question is do russian speakers see those colors as differently experience 
as somehow differently i tell you what anyone sees sc a problem a problem with consciousness in all these 
lb yes perception is a private experience so ultimately beyond our tools of measurement so all we can do 
say how efficiently can you make this judgement how likely are you to be correct if we stress the 
things like that and from that we can say well the brain seems to have an easier time making 
distinction than that we can also make measurements directly from the brain and say oh the brain of a 
speaker responds if you shift the colors from light blue to dark blue get a surprise response sc is 
like an mri machine or something how do you poke into their brains lb describing eg results where measuring 
very fast response that just kind of says something has changed right so like a surprise marker and if 
show you a series of blues when crossed the boundary from light blue to dark blue the brain of 
russian speaker a greek speaker for example will give that surprise response that says oh shifted category something new 
happening whereas the same series of colors will not give that response in an english brain because nothing the 
changing right so again we can tell that the brain is treating these things differently but i tell you 
people see things and anything about how anyone sees anything really sc right what was it was it the 
hypothesis am i getting it right lb sapirwhorf yeah sc sapir lb sapir sc sapirwhorf that basically said that 
language controls what we see how would you phrase the hypothesis lb there are many different versions of the 
so benjamin lee whorf died young and a lot of his writings were published posthumously so like imagine all 
notes that you sc oh no going to be burned lb but in his writings he says lots of 
things a very strong hypothesis might be that language controls thought and you can never have thoughts that are 
of your language another version might be that language is one of the contributors to how we come to 
the world and it might be a stronger influence in some domains where less information from the world there 
be a less strong influence than others but in general there is this interesting idea out there that says 
language is a straitjacket for thought maybe we think outside of the bounds of our language and i think 
is a particularly odd idea because you can always learn new ways of talking right and also to invent 
feature of a language you have to have at least partially the thought first and so it seems to 
that language be truly a straitjacket for thought but language can certainly encourage patterns and entrench us into ways 
thinking so that we even consider other options sc i mean i always thought of what about an instrumental 
of music i can think of that like in my brain but in the form of language so like 
most naive reading of that hypothesis be quite right lb yeah so wittgenstein makes this wonderful example or to 
to show that some things are very expressible in the language and others not so he says if i 
you the height of mount kilimanjaro if you know the answer you can easily express it in language but 
i ask you what does a clarinet sound like going to be really hard right sc yeah hard to 
right lb if you already know what a clarinet sounds like not going to be able to say very 
useful things that will really help you and so there are definitely a lot of a lot of mental 
that exists outside of the purview of language or is not as effable as other things sc and my 
is that the sapirwhorf hypothesis was popular and then faded and maybe getting a little bit of comeback lb 
was popular when whorf was writing people sc so when was that lb he was writing in the and 
a lot of his writings were then published after his death there was a collection of them published in 
but there really any research about it right sc just talk lb so one thing for the idea to 
popular right another thing to actually go and do experiments and one of the reasons is that all of 
people doing work in communities that were not just colleges in the us with english speakers englishspeaking sophomores who 
subjects sc who are test subjects yes lb all of those people using the tools of cognitive psychology or 
in general they were linguists or anthropologists they were doing descriptive work and so when they would come back 
their field sites and say i worked in this community and they do psychologists would treat that as like 
stories in travel journals they would be like well lovely that you had that sc a little a okay 
you had that experience but not science and but at the same time psychologists were completely shielded from being 
to discover any of these fascinating differences because they never left their labs and the only people they ever 
were englishspeaking sophomores and so if the only people you ever test you never see evidence of diversity so 
protected yourself from discovering any interesting phenomena right and sc i mean is there a time when that began 
shift lb in the finally there started to be a marriage where inspiration from field linguistics and linguistic anthropology 
filtering into psychology and then psychologists started collaborating with linguists and anthropologists to design experiments a relationship of building 
across those disciplines because different fields have different ways of knowing and different things they trust to be true 
trained as an experimentalist so i believe data i want things to come from a controlled experiment and if 
two columns of numbers i can compare nothing is true right lb but at the same time also come 
see how much of our interpretation of the data has to rely on a rich understanding of the context 
which you collected the data so if i go to a community for a week and do an experiment 
what i learn is the data that i got in the experiment and of what i learn is just 
there and seeing how people interact and how whatever practice trying to measure in this little toy experiment actually 
in the community and how it performs that gives me so much more comfort in interpreting the data and 
sure that not just grossly misinterpreting what the two columns of numbers were saying sc does that pose a 
for the practice of science in that harder to objectively communicate what learned in a journal article than it 
for some quantitative data lb well still an experimentalist so i always am at the end of the day 
a controlled experiment and doing statistics on the data so true but i think it is a really interesting 
for all of the behavioral sciences and all of the social sciences to think who our subjects of study 
so when talking about sc people right as a physicist i can avoid this problem but you yeah lb 
when talking about humans usually people will just test american undergrads and say discovered how humans do something a 
strange kind of human a very very unusual kind of human so how do you actually create a rich 
of the human mind in all of the different contexts that it exists and the incredible ingenuity and flexibility 
you see around the world in all of these different contexts that to me is the real cool stuff 
human minds do the more we constrain the set of people that we study the less actually allowing ourselves 
understand the real meat of what it is to be human and what it is to have this cool 
brain that can do all these things and is so flexible sc and even if language does not absolutely 
what we can understand so it does seem that the pendulum is swinging towards thinking that it affects how 
understand things and maybe in a profound way maybe not just colors and directions sc it definitely creates habits 
thought it lays down patterns that are easy to follow and then you follow those patterns in some cases 
creates foundations for whole realms of thought the domain of number is a good example of that of course 
english we have numbers everyone learns those numbers as a kid sc did we always have those in indoeuropean 
i guess the zero came late lb zero is very late yeah well the decimal positional system that we 
now for representing numbers i think comes to europe in the with fibonacci so he takes it from the 
world which took it from india the idea sc but counting numbers were always there in indoeuropean languages lb 
is a long time sc always is a long time i yeah lb we know about always because language 
a physical trace in the fossil record so when you go beyond the written record which is very very 
for the human race we actually can only make inferences about what might have been there so extremely unlikely 
always is true sc yeah i was exaggerating again helped me very good lb but there are lot of 
that have exact number words or have words that are just few and many some languages use a base 
system for their number system they use base six or base eight or base twelve or base sc yeah 
nuts lb eightyone is true i definitely know of a language that sc i think one hundred twenty was 
lb the babylonians had a lot of things that were based on and so you get from units of 
was a common thing in general body parts are good so twenty are common but then some people use 
different way of thinking about body parts for example they might use links on your fingers and so you 
some might use knuckles in which case you get sc okay lb some people for example a group in 
new guinea that has a base twentyseven that just starts with the fingers on one hand and goes across 
top of your body including parts of your face and your head and goes on the other side then 
you need to go above you just go in the other direction and so you say a second elbow 
time back the body part terms are actually the names of the numbers so if you want eight potatoes 
potatoes so languages have all of these different systems for numbers and some have exact numbers at all lb 
case where as you said zero came late in human civilization so there are millions of humans running around 
to think about things and it takes a very special one or a group of humans to come up 
this very useful innovation of zero that makes it a really good number system that you can better than 
roman numerals that the europeans had before certainly for mental calculation right but we all we all now completely 
it for granted you and i know the number system impossible to imagine not knowing it impossible to imagine 
ever not being in your language but someone had to invent it and not something a project for a 
sc no no no lb it took a really long time for that to come about and it happen 
very many places in the world but now we have it and so such ungrateful punks we take it 
granted like of course it always existed i would have thought of it even if someone but all this 
labor of all these people that is just built into language and now fiveyearolds have the cognitive skills that 
to be only available to a very few adepts even just five hundred years ago sc because of that 
of the builtin structure of the language they get to learn lb because now part of the language and 
is trained on it from early on you even remember learning it and completely ungrateful for it sc but 
notions like causality influence and you mentioned the billiard balls blame and intentionality these are all built into how 
talk also lb yeah whenever something happens you have to construe it in some way there is a physical 
that occurs but then you also have to think about did it just happen did someone do it sc 
fault is it right lb whose fault is it sc is it an accident lb yeah and there are 
many different ways that language allows you to construe or describe any given event for example let me give 
a famous accident when dick cheney went out hunting with his buddy harry whittington and shot him accidentally in 
face sc in the face lb yeah so you could say cheney shot whittington you could say whittington got 
by cheney you could just say whittington got shot leave cheney out of it altogether you could focus on 
manner so you could say whittington got peppered pretty good that was a headline from a texas newspaper cheney 
when he was apologizing said the guy that pulled the trigger that fired the round that hit so the 
that pulled the so he takes it take a very long time to shoot your friend in the face 
split second physical event you think pretty simple but he takes a split second event and breaks it up 
a long chain and he just happens to be on one end of that causal chain bush actually did 
better he said something like he heard a bird flush and he turned and pulled the trigger and saw 
friend get wounded in that description cheney transforms from agent to mere witness by the end of the sentence 
is a masterful exculpation sc yeah lb i give you those examples funny examples of linguistic wiggling but we 
to do this all the time whenever choosing a verb choosing how much time going to compress into an 
so i could say we built rome we cured polio well a whole lot of things had to happen 
lot of events a lot of time for any of those things so i can use one verb for 
extremely complex longstanding processes or i could use four verbs to say i shot my friend in the face 
always taking a perspective when choosing a verb and also taking a perspective depending on whether you say i 
the vase or the vase broke or it so happened to me that the vase broke shifting blame shifting 
languages choose differently how to describe events so in english for example we are not that careful about distinguishing 
from intentional actions so you can say things like i broke my arm where in lots of other languages 
say that unless a lunatic looking to go break your arm and you succeeded you would say something sc 
lb my arm got broken it so happened to me that my arm broke but in english whether intentional 
accidental common to say an agentive thing like he broke the vase i broke my arm i lost the 
book if you try to say lost a library in spanish people look at you and say why would 
do that sc why would you do that lb what kind of person would do that sc so in 
it would be different constructions for i lost the library book intentionally or i lost it by accident lb 
yeah if a weird person who intentionally loses a book but you would express it as something like the 
got lost or the book lost itself to me or something like that sc yeah lb because you intend 
do it but in the case where say you broke a vase by accident in english you would still 
i broke it normal if you say i broke it if you say something like it broke people think 
whereas in lots of languages you would have to use a different construction sc writers are taught not to 
the passive voice because it is less active weaker right lb yeah this agentive nonagentive is a little different 
a little different yeah lb passive active let me give you an example i love so take caesar romeo 
socrates drank the poison socrates was forced to drink poison he knew that he was drinking poison he had 
do it he was sentenced to death by poison right romeo drank the poison he meant to drink poison 
was intentionally drinking poison caesar drank the poison caesar thought he was drinking wine but his wine was poisoned 
intentionally drinking but unknowingly to him poison in english we can say he drank the poison in each case 
drank the poison romeo drank the poison socrates drank the poison there are languages were those three would require 
grammatical constructions because in those languages important whether someone is doing something knowingly whether doing something willfully whether volitional 
dhivehi for example this is a language spoken in the maldives you would use three different constructions for those 
different guys because they are circumstances that are importantly different and have to be marked grammatically differently in those 
sc and just like the ability to keep track of numbers and so forth i presume this does have 
effect on how we conceptualize the world a little bit this is probably full employment for you and people 
your lab to figure out do we assign praise and blame differently if we speak one of these slightly 
languages are we more willing to let things slide or are we more dodgy lb yeah well so let 
give you an example just from english we did this experiment right after the super bowl where janet jackson 
justin timberlake performed together and they had this very famous incident that became the first wardrobe malfunction sc right 
so the term wardrobe malfunction was born after that incident and the reason we chose that incident was we 
something that was saturated for people that they had seen it many times before and they knew a lot 
it seen it discussed in the news in case people remember in the final dance move justin timberlake reached 
janet chest and then for of a second one of her breasts was partially exposed on national television and 
was extremely scandalous sc decline of the west yeah lb yes the fcc tried to fine cbs five hundred 
thousand dollars for the indecency and people were so outraged it quickly became the most event of all time 
i assume they just had to sc so outraged lb go back and review it just to make sure 
were extremely outraged yet again so we thought well what if you take an event even this saturated and 
can see it yourself with your own eyes you can to the right so we have this sense we 
this expression in english go to the as if if you just see it with your own eyes have 
direct perception of reality right so we say okay well go to the tape for something that already seen 
times anyway could we still change the way people blame and punish the people involved depending on what grammatical 
we use to describe it sc okay lb and so we show the people the video we tell them 
unfastened the snap or the snap and then we ask much is he to blame and how much of 
five hundred fifty thousand dollars should he and not only do people blame timberlake more if we say unfastened 
but they also want to charge him more in fines alright sc so the rubber hits the road as 
yeah like they lb yeah so even though you have this feeling like can see what happened i can 
it with my own the way that we describe things the way we tend to describe this things or 
way things are framed for us by other people makes a real difference even when you can see things 
your own eyes sc yeah and presumably this pervades everything in ways that we even know i mean an 
thing to discuss is gender in language right there are ongoing questions about pronouns in english but other languages 
way more gendered than english is lb and some are way less gendered sc and some are way less 
so i mean one question is when i took german in high school i was told sure der die 
das that these genders but they have nothing whatsoever to do with the sex of human beings or anything 
that and i was always a little bit suspicious that there was zero connotation in the brain do we 
anything about how the existence of those different labels affects how people perceive the different things lb yeah so 
is coming back to the question you asked earlier about to what extent does language reflect reality or to 
extent is it creating its own reality i think this is a really wonderful example of how language creates 
that is completely unrelated to reality right sc yeah lb so we have these grammatical gender systems where every 
is masculine or feminine so chairs tables watering cans toasters all are either masculine or feminine and the amazing 
is speakers of those languages actually take those as meaningful right so if you ask even young kids for 
can you assign voices for animated characters so going to have a toaster be the star of this animated 
what voice should it have young kids who are learning spanish or french as their first language will pick 
boy voice or a girl voice depending on the grammatical gender of the noun adults will give you different 
of an object like a bridge depending on whether masculine or feminine in their language and if you ask 
of one of these languages is this word masculine in your or is it say it reflects some reality 
the sc completely different in a different language lb exactly language has intuited something that is otherwise invisible about 
object the sun is masculine because it is truly masculine and my language is simply picking up like it 
that french is such a sensitive language picked up on true genders of all these inanimate whereas once you 
bilinguals who speak two languages that have different gender systems then they start to see well this is just 
formal property of the and they say that so i think we believe the structures of our languages a 
more than we should we often believe that the categories that happen to exist in our language are the 
of reality but in fact lots of other categories are possible and those categories could be collapsed or they 
be refined lb and all of those are simply models so when we go back to gender for humans 
example if you have a language that requires humans to be either male or female in the language you 
to have he or she and no other way easy to come to believe that a necessary distinction and 
could not think of a human unless you put them in one of those two categories but if you 
a language that actually make that distinction lots of languages have any gender marking in that case not a 
it actually even occur to you as a thing to worry about sc yeah i mean only one of 
million different ways we could distinguish between people lb right yeah sc that we assign a pronoun to lb 
it is interesting that gender is one of the only things that languages mark on pronouns some languages will 
about age so there are a couple of other things that get encoded but gender is one of the 
things that you encode sc a big one yeah lb and you could argue that from an information point 
view other things might be more useful like you could encode height or eye color or education level or 
to curl twenty pounds whatever it is that you could want to know about someone but we focus on 
but also people often feel very attached to whichever specific way their language does gender so for example in 
people might be very adamant that you replace he and she with they because you have to have gendered 
and how could you speak a language that have gender what would pronouns even mean and i always point 
that in fact almost all pronouns in english are already genderneutral so i we they you lb in fact 
third person singular pronouns have gender and never heard someone say know what we really need to add more 
to the other some languages do that thai has different gender words for i hebrew has different gender words 
you spanish has different gender words for they plural right so you could advocate for that but just never 
someone say that people feel very attached to whichever way their language happens to be in the moment but 
things do can and do change sc do you think it is changing do you think going to switch 
a they third person universal pronoun do you think we should lb so singular they has existed in english 
a really long time there are lots of classical uses of it that people even hear as strange at 
so if i say anybody calls tell them not an indeterminate sc yes exactly lb oh yeah you can 
these examples in shakespeare and jane austen an old use in sc if you know the gender of the 
then you use he or she but if you use they lb yeah and so the use of singular 
is on the rise in english people like it they use it and so as it becomes more popular 
people continue to like it and use it going to sound more and more normal and the few cases 
there is some ambiguity or difficulty in parsing you know if singular or plural just resolve those with context 
time or people will come up with other solutions lb whether whether i would prescribe something is like they 
or i think it really depends on what purpose what goal trying to achieve so a lot of languages 
trying to come up with gender neutral ways of speaking because categorizing people into just two categories misses a 
of people who feel like they could cleanly be categorized into those two categories or sometimes because they feel 
it puts too much emphasis on gender and the first thing that you experience about someone is gender it 
implicit bias to creep in and so on but other languages are adding more gender so for example in 
the académie française this is the body that decides what is and officially part of the french language sc 
king of french yeah lb yeah they have just approved a whole bunch of new feminine forms for professions 
so the idea is that it creates visibility for the fact that there are female surgeons and there are 
soldiers and there are female bosses and there are female presidents right and so you could say a good 
because if there are women doing those jobs and you hear the feminine form it creates a norm that 
do exist in these positions of power but at the same time it has a potential to backfire because 
a lot of cases it matter the gender of the person matter for their job so if i say 
delivered the or something like that well if required to mark that a female statistician as opposed to a 
statistician does that allow you to start thinking about your gender biases about who can do math and who 
math is a female statistician a different job than a male statistician in the same way that actress is 
as a less prestigious job than actor or a waitress is seen as a less prestigious job than waiter 
the female actors i know in hollywood like to be called actors lb exactly because more prestige associated with 
male term and more pay associated sc but i know french very well are the existing french nouns implicitly 
marked and trying to add a female version of it so i can imagine women not wanting to say 
man doing that job so a sticky situation i know what where to go lb the forms for a 
of jobs the forms that exist are explicitly masculine forms and so the académie française has just approved the 
almost any profession can be easily feminized in french the way that french is constructed just that they approved 
official things that you could put in a newspaper for example sc so like you turn en into enne 
something like that lb yeah yes or add an e at the end to depending on the structure sc 
okay well i so this is a good place to wrap up i mean a scientist you describe what 
in the world how people talk how it affects their lives and things like that but also a person 
have some preferences how much do you either feel or need to resist the urge to be judgy to 
it would be better if we spoke this you know you appreciate a lot more than the average person 
the way that we use language affects how we think about things does it make you want to go 
talk this lb oh well i think of language as a tool and so i think that the way 
talk should serve the purposes that trying to achieve and so for me for example with respect to gender 
think it would be really great to have gender as something optional so when you want to include it 
relevant you include it and when you want to include it or not relevant you include it in the 
way that you do for almost any other personal characteristic so i can talk about you without ever mentioning 
height or your eye color or your religion or your profession and if i want to include that information 
i can do it not hard not forbidden but just not part of every single utterance lb and so 
think that system would be really nice so if i had to make a new language i would make 
language that makes it possible to not include information when harmful or problematic to include it and then to 
it when useful sc and in this language would time move from left to right or right to left 
lb well actually you know in english time move left to right or right to left in the language 
sc the language do some languages do it lb there so every time i say on the radio that 
lay out time from left to right in metaphor so we say tuesday is left of wednesday for example 
get a phone call from someone in the military that says we say and because in the military they 
this calendar this perpetual calendar that runs from left to right and everything is scheduled in that left to 
stream and in fact starting to become a linguistic metaphor so people when shifting schedules will say shifting or 
so it and some of my collaborators here at ucsd have started testing speakers of military english and in 
they do say things that speakers of nonmilitary english civilian english would find to be odd or ungrammatical but 
have a structured particular way of using left and right and there are metaphors that have come from this 
of this perpetual left right stream calendar sc well you already noted that for every rule we try to 
going to be exceptions and so we keep finding them lb yeah humans keep innovating the wonderful thing about 
human mind is we have infinite possibility in there sc i agree with that one alright lera boroditsky thanks 
much for being on the mindscape podcast lb thank you for having me been fun music there seem to 
modifications of spoken english forcing more on the listener wondering where coming from i have gribnuficitie my wife knows 
have of a a twentyfour year old graduate student may think i have fewer things or less stuff no 
unless they know something about grinuficitie up to himherit to go figure out something about gribnuficitie so my wife

thoughts jeff on my previous ramble just pointing out the seemily sudden loss of the use of in american 
everything people water cars trees wheat sewage peanuts etc are described by the of itthem i actually remember the 
time i heard this driving to work switched to an fm rock station to hear the of people at 
concert was less than fortythree years on the planet had lived in seven states in the us visited and 
to the local news in dozens of cities north south east and west i had never heard people referred 
by an amount i assumed the twentytwo year old on air talent was going to giggle and describe the 
of concert attendees in gallons or pounds maybe acrefeet but no now eightyseven year old refer to amounts of 
trees continuously i am shocked when someone uses to describe a group of things could your guest post something 
that might shed light on howwhenwhy everyone can rapidly dumb down in this way many thanks jeff i once 
of a quote supposedly written on a public restroom wall that time is what keeps everything from happening at 
in the matter of how we visualize concepts i have always wondered if anyone else visualizes the months of 
year the way i do i assume that most people visualize months as they appear in a calendar but 
see them on a horizontal line that runs perpendicular to my eyes from january to may then june through 
take a ninety degree turn to the left on the same plane before september through december turn back to 
original direction this zig zag pattern has always puzzled me jim wade so basically what you are saying is 
your own visualization of the months of the year has always puzzled you really make much sense to be 
especially since what describing is far from complicated to visualize hi an old psycholinguist i loved this episode you 
interested in learning a language something with which i have much experience my goal is to learn to read 
enjoy literature speaking is not my thing nor is travel but learning to read a language is an excellent 
for learning to speak the best way i know to learn to read a language is this pick a 
novel or whatever you like learn to type in your target language easy on your computer type the first 
of page one of your text into google translate which has gotten very good fairly recently look at the 
depending on how far your target language is from english probably be able to figure out happening if not 
do that again do not work at this try to memorize anything just pay attention your brain will do 
work after a few days begin to pick up a few words after a few weeks be getting phrases 
sentences after a few months or maybe a year or two if working on a harder language for english 
be reading the text pretty well without lookups somewhere along the way become curious enough and have enough of 
feel for the language that it would be useful to look at a grammar not a primer a descriptive 
and to use a dictionary now and then but all the way through just let your brain do the 
it will pleasantly surprise you enjoy watching your brain do its fascinating work never worry about what you know 
congratulate yourself on what you do know be stay motivated keep burning in front of you the vision of 
able to pick up a book in your target language and simply read it both easier and harder than 
people think you cannot get the whole job done in a month or two but on the other hand 
is no trick to it no harder than making a habit of walking around the block to improve your 
you can do it working now on polish and have used this technique with dutch italian and to improve 
german which was already not too bad aloha pohaku nezami looking forward to youtube videos yet to come maybe 
on why quantum physics make proper use of the english language the wave function does not collapse wowinteresting those 
people always know which way is north in their geography we mock the flat earthers but we are all 
flat earthers by heart now we drive by gps satellites which have to take into account the curvature of 
earth to calculate to inches which lane we are actually driving is that child on that island that follows 
tradition centuries old to know north any different from our child who knows how to navigate the iphone pingback
