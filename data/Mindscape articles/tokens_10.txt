sean carroll and today hopefully everyone is staying safe staying healthy still under lockdown quarantine social distancing and so 
sc what offering you today is a chance to be distracted a little bit by one of favorite things 
be distracted by lions and tigers and bears oh my mostly bears to be perfectly honest but what going 
be talking about are carnivorous animals predators in the wild and both how they hang out and how they 
out with human beings how they interact with us and how they should interact with us sc so my 
is dr rae wynngrant who is a large carnivore ecologist she studies again bears are her favorite thing but 
lions and other large predators and tries to figure out what their behavior is out there in the wild 
far they go when they go walking their mating habits and stuff like that as we will learn as 
learned this is not a gorillas in the mist or jane goodall hanging out with the chimpanzees kind of 
basically you want to hang out with the bears you want to live with the bears sc werner herzog 
notwithstanding you want to like touch the bears just enough to put a collar on them trace them to 
where going and then let them do their thing but an important thing because we want to be able 
live in harmony or as close as we can come to it with the wildlife around us and some 
that wildlife is dangerous some of that wildlife is big and has claws and teeth and can hurt us 
want to protect that as well so we need to understand it scientifically and what talking about today sc 
other thing to mention is that rae is going to appear on a tv special releasing this podcast monday 
wednesday april is of course earth day and for mindscape fans it is also the birthday of ariel and 
my cats but that is a coincidence that ariel and caliban were born on earth day more importantly national 
is releasing a special to celebrate the anniversary of earth day on april a television event called born wild 
next generation and rae will appear in there with a whole bunch of other people rae in fact works 
a fellow for the national geographic society as well as being a visiting scientist at the american museum of 
history sc so if you want to see more the pictures and the videos are always a hugely compelling 
of this kind of story the audio is great the audio conversation we had was very entertaining but if 
really want to feel yourself there out in the wild with the bears and the lions watch the tv 
and with that go music sc rae wynngrant welcome to the mindscape podcast rae wynngrant thank you for having 
happy to be here sc certainly a fascinating topic to talk about so i think that the tentative title 
came up for this podcast episode is rae wynngrant on bears humans and other predators and predators are sort 
weirdly alluring weirdly compelling right what is it that makes us so interested in giant animals that can easily 
us rw well you know i have a lot of different theories on this but they are so good 
storytelling right chuckle and stories are such an important part of human culture worldwide throughout history and the danger 
again like it just feeds in so well to stories and just charismatic i mean not every carnivore out 
in the world is the most charismatic animal but everything from bears lions sharks the really cool carnivorous plants 
fascinating they just are chuckle so i blame people who are being captivated by them they hooked me sc 
did strike me while i was thinking about this that our most popular domestic pets come from carnivores from 
dogs and cats there are bunnies and hamsters but nothing quite like a good dangerous cat to get people 
interested rw in fact i was just watching an old episode of cosmos with neil degrasse tyson where he 
how we domesticated wolves into dogs ages ago and why and how such a mutually beneficial relationship and it 
just i think that kind of story never gets old as well to really understand that we took the 
wild animals that could have killed us and turned them into best friend chuckle sc well certainly you count 
someone who is fascinated by these things i want to get into the science of it but let me 
first ask about your research process lots of pictures of you out there in the field with bears with 
and so forth so number one what do you do number two is it mostly studying the animals for 
own sakes or is it the interaction with human beings that you care about rw yeah great questions and 
happy to talk about myself chuckle so a carnivore ecologist ecology is a study of organisms and how they 
with their environment carnivores to oversimplify are meateating organisms and i have a lot of great images out there 
me handling some large carnivores because i do a lot of fieldwork so a lot of ways to do 
ecology i like to tell people that wildlife ecologists can be in the field in the lab in the 
all different ways to do this work but i choose to kind of do a hybrid of fieldwork and 
biology and then data analysis which is bringing me back into the office space sc yeah rw and my 
goals at this moment and since i started my career is to look at patterns of movement and behavior 
so usually when out there trapping use bears for an example trapping bears and handling them so that i 
attach a gps collar to these animals so i do not just go out into the wilderness and find 
and cuddle them for fun although i deny that it is extremely fun sc it can be fun rw 
it is extremely purposeful right and very very very purposeful and the only way to get a gps unit 
an animal is to capture that animal and put that collar on and so where most of those images 
from so a lot of photos out there of me with bears that are sleeping they have been sedated 
that i can do this work and that is probably the last time that i will come into physical 
with that animal for a year or two until i find them again to take the collar off and 
i probably interact with them again so really important for me to drive home to a lot of folks 
there that the best ecology is noninvasive not a good idea to get animals used to humans and habituated 
humans so really like sedating them for a few moments getting these devices on doing health checks checkups especially 
juveniles or babies and then getting out of there and getting that data analyzing those patterns and learning about 
animal from as far away as possible is the best method sc i mean there are other approaches right 
knows about jane goodall and living with the chimpanzees where almost more anthropology where really trying to study their 
by interacting with them so very good been very clear that in there to sort of attach some data 
device to them and then let them live their natural life and what actually trying to study rw exactly 
and jane goodall is a huge huge inspiration for me sc sure rw so in a lot of ways 
bow down to her and her early work but again she going to every chimpanzee population on the continent 
africa and living with them she was taking one to use as a case study to understand their behavior 
that we have to go into the other populations and do the same thing sc right rw right so 
of like taking one for the team becoming habituated to humans so that we can understand their biology their 
use that information to kind of make scientific conclusions for the whole species sc okay so i really want 
sort of put myself in as much of the shoes or boots of you when out there tracking the 
as i can i mean do you know exactly where the bear is going to be how do you 
it that is one question rw oh yeah i love talking about this stuff so probably some of my 
and most boring stories from the field are about looking for bears because the answer to your question is 
we do not know where they are going to be sc i thought so yeah rw if we use 
bears as an example i think hilarious because when i tell people that i study black bears almost everybody 
tell has a black bear story to tell me they went camping they saw a bear they grew up 
vermont and bears used to come into their backyards whatever it is so many folks have a bear story 
have actually struggled to find bears when i need to find them i know if like bad luck if 
have a curse whatever it is in my entire life i have never seen a bear on accident ever 
sc oh my goodness even i have done that rw ever never i mean i would love it so 
looking for these extremely wild back country animals a lot of the time i am hiking camping in the 
country for sometimes weeks on end setting traps and these are baited traps sc okay rw to lure bears 
the trap so that they will be captured i can tranquillize them put the collar on and then release 
so to be clear when talking about baiting a trap baiting it with things like a can of tuna 
something that is like yummysmelling but also appropriate bears ear a lot of fish so it is very natural 
them and then these traps are typically what we call barrel traps or culvert traps which are very large 
big enough to hold a couple of bears in them almost like a big cage sc oh okay rw 
the bear walks into the trap the food the baited food is at the back once it uses its 
to take the food a door closes on the opposite side and i check that trap twice a day 
make sure a bear in there for too long it is contained in there so it gives me an 
shot to kinda stick it with a jab stick with the sedative sc okay so not like a gun 
distance you have to get close enough to poke the bear literally rw yes quite literally and not to 
it twisted we do have tranquillizer guns those are typically used when a bear is in a tree and 
would say like when a bear is causing a problem sc sure rw like if they were having a 
conflict issue when a bear is in backyard going through their trash and then the authorities show up and 
goes up the tree when we might have to shoot it with a tranquillizer just so that we can 
it back down and take it and release it back into the forest but when it comes to me 
bears for the purposes of putting a collar on them really just like a syringe on the edge of 
long stick sometimes i can whittle that stick together myself and you just poke the bear in the shoulder 
is probably about the same as getting a flu shot and less possibly less painful in about five or 
minutes they fall asleep asleep for about an hour rw a way to measure them take their temperature i 
to use rectal thermometers i always try to throw that in there because people think amusing check the bear 
parasites so for ectoparasites sc but you also threw in there that you weigh them that sounds like an 
bit of effort there rw yeah only able to weigh these bears if working with a team so certainly 
when doing this fieldwork alone or maybe with one other assistant but if ever lucky enough to have a 
with me which is about half of the time we weigh the bear so when it is sedated and 
cold we have a tarp we all lift the many hundreds of pound bears on to the tarp and 
a big stick so find some type of big log or something nearby rope the tarp around the log 
have a scale that we bring with us it is all very makeshift but we weigh the bear in 
of kilograms right there in the wilderness sc so when the bear is in the trap is it sad 
it angry are these bears used to this kind of nonsense or is it an angry bear that you 
to deal with rw yeah certainly not used to it so very unnatural one of the things that i 
about bears is that they have any natural predators sc right rw in their environment so top of the 
chain apex predators themselves so found that they are not super afraid necessarily of being in a trap bears 
a lot of fear sc i see rw but they will get aggravated they want to be in there 
once the food is gone they want to keep on moving so really important just to be humane to 
sure that the bear have too much of a stress response to make sure that we are not keeping 
in there for more than a couple of hours i will also say big large carnivores do a lot 
resting so it is not uncommon to have a bear go into a trap get the food realize they 
out and have it just lay down for a bit and just take a rest in the shade sc 
that part has been preserved in the domesticated cat i can assure you a lot of that gets done 
yeah absolutely a perfect example sc and so then you put the collar on and a gps system is 
it or is there a more complicated apparatus involved rw no a gps collar so the same gps that 
might have in our smartphones a small device that hangs off of the collar it is very light many 
them are large in size but that does not equate to a heavy weight sc yeah okay rw so 
this lightweight collar that goes on the bear and that you guessed sends a signal to a satellite in 
space and the satellite sends a signal to my computer that lets me know the longitude and latitude of 
bear every couple of hours and so that data gets stored in a database and updated every few hours 
i have way more data than i would ever need of where this bear is going and looking over 
course of a year or best case scenario over two years able to really establish the home range of 
animal and understand where it goes and where it spends its time sc so not tempted to put a 
camera on there a little webcam on the collar rw i wish we could get that far i wish 
had that type of opportunities but we really we do a lot of trail cameras i will say so 
that i am associated with national geographic been introduced to all of these cool photographers who often accompany biologists 
the field and they set these great camera traps and they really position them amazing the type of images 
they get so maybe a carcass that they expect a wolf or a bear or a mountain lion to 
back to at some point and position this camera trap right there at the carcass and get these amazing 
i use camera traps absolutely all the time but when using them just to keep an eye on my 
trap and that is because from time to time i will set a trap and actually have nonbear animals 
in steal the food and go back out without being trapped sc sure yummy tuna fish in there rw 
i put camera traps out just to see going on and why i keep striking out chuckle sc and 
bears this is north america mostly doing this rw yup i do do work in north america eight different 
species around the world over four continents i study north american bears at the moment so black bears and 
bears and hoping some time soon some polar bears sc okay rw but of course brown bears are also 
parts of europe and asia and so a lot of the conclusions and the ecological information that getting from 
is useful in other parts of the world sc and so what is it that actually learning from these 
studies clearly their range but is it more behavioral is it more ecological rw yeah both both so i 
to do a lot of comparisons and compare the movement of bears that live in what call the back 
so areas very very far from human presence and compare that to the movement of bears that live in 
around areas of high human activity and finding some things that might seem obvious to people that back country 
will have a much larger home range so a lot of people will call that territory size bears are 
solitary animals so not going to find a mama bear and a papa bear hanging out together despite what 
might tell us chuckle by themselves and so they are also territorial and so they like to establish their 
territories so see really really big home ranges for bears that have that kind of space rw but for 
of a better word urban bears i want people to take that term too far because not in the 
but for bears that kind of live on the edge of the humanwild land interface finding much more condensed 
ranges much more overlap especially in areas where there are an abundance of food and resources i also love 
gps collars to look at where female bears den in the winter one of the coolest things about north 
bears i think is that they hibernate and that is awesome and figuring out where they choose to make 
den is really interesting there are some patterns that we see there sometimes we see female bears choosing to 
closer to areas of human activity and male bears denning further from human activity it raises a lot of 
are females doing that because the males have picked the best habitat and they have to go for a 
best habitat or is there something about being near to people that is actually a better place for females 
den especially when giving birth to cubs a lot of unanswered questions there but to me fascinating sc i 
plenty of colleagues at caltech who live in pasadena or altadena and get bears showing up to their swimming 
in their backyards all the time so at the bearhuman interface right around here i can believe it rw 
course there are sc and so interesting so when the bears hibernate they do it solo not with a 
rw right yes so again i like to often go back to stories because so sweet they always have 
very pleasant bear families and bear communities all hanging out and that is just so not realistic sc yeah 
bears are by themselves so one bear in a large part of the forest again they are they are 
close together even when hibernating in dens so the only time going to have more than one bear in 
den is if you have a female who has given birth and has cubs with her sc okay rw 
that i think is awesome that i think everyone should think is awesome is that females begin hibernation while 
and actually give birth in the den so in the ecology community we basically estimate that every bear in 
america ever been born was born in january that is just around the time we all give them a 
birth date estimate around the time that the females give birth in the den and then they give birth 
these teeny tiny little bears i mean black bear cubs at birth can be about a pound sc oh 
goodness rw and polar bear cubs at birth could be about a poundandahalf really really small and kind of 
and blind and they just a couple of them come out they nurse on their mother for three four 
five months until safe to come out of the den and by that time big and strong and able 
take on the world sc how big is a litter rw so a litter is typically two to three 
black bears two to three for brown bears as well but they can be big we usually see four 
more but depending on the region two or three is typical sc a little interesting to me that they 
out in families because since human beings do this inevitable temptation to say things like well of course mothers 
fathers stick with their children because they want to protect their genetic line and preserve it and so forth 
then every such generalization has a million counter examples in the animal kingdom why male papa bears want to 
their kids is there an explanation for that kind of thing rw you know we necessarily have an explanation 
it but it is in line with solitary wildlife species so the social animals i know if we stick 
carnivores the social carnivores do that so wolves will create a pack and they will the wolf dad will 
his wolf daughter off and teach her how to hunt and always protect her and a very strong family 
we see that with lion prides so a male lion at the top of its harem will have all 
different females but will make sure that no really going anywhere but with bears with mountain lions with other 
predators really just seeing very very different behavior kind of all for one oneforall a male bear will mate 
a female and probably never see her again and never see his offspring sc but is there some theoretical 
of what makes a species social or not in that sense rw not necessarily that aware of at least 
kind of this pack animal mentality and i think it also has a lot to do with how they 
how they eat and how they feed so if you look at bears so fortunate that they although carnivores 
are highly omnivorous right their diet they have a lot of dietary plasticity is how we say it in 
so they do great eating fish taking down deer in parts of the country where i study bears we 
them eating wild horses the farms of wild horses a lot of highly carnivorous predatory behavior but they also 
just as well eating fruit and eating root vegetables and nuts and seeds and berries and all of that 
of thing rw and because of that kind of less dependent on each other or on a group to 
food resources and survive mountain lions are obligate carnivores they do a lot of hunting they have to kind 
cache their prey away once they make a kill but they seem to do pretty well being independent i 
love to dig into more of the theory of why some are and some but at this point bears 
do their own thing one of the things i love about them because i love my alone time i 
myself a solitary predator sc bears are introverts laughter rw yeah like an introvert in a lot of ways 
just really like having my own space and so i can relate to them a lot sc well i 
this is it raises up a whole another set of questions that i was interested in asking you about 
are there carnivores at all predators at all in the sense that a carnivore something that eats other animals 
on the whole huge ecosystem more or less operating pretty well right those animals have to eat plants and 
plants have to exist whereas if you just eat the plants directly maybe things are a little bit more 
for you is it just a matter of efficiency i know of course far fewer predators carnivores than there 
herbivores but they are there in just about every ecosystem right rw pretty much yeah and we see a 
of issues when carnivores are removed from different ecosystems so they are important and i love that you were 
to acknowledge that we need as many carnivores in a space as we do herbivores and composters and all 
the others but they play a big role i love using bears as an example again they are really 
seed dispersers so we depend on bats we depend on other types of animals herbivores for our seed dispersing 
bears do a great job of that but they also distribute vital nutrients that they get from eating animals 
if we take those brown bears up in alaska that just go crazy eating salmon during the salmon run 
they poop all throughout the forest distributing vital nitrogen all throughout the forest that comes from eating those fish 
digesting those bones that allows the forest to regenerate and keep growing so the plant community is in a 
of ways dependent on carnivores eating meat and getting those types of nutrients especially nitrogen and distributing it pretty 
and wide sc so that makes sense in terms of the benefit that they get what is the benefit 
the carnivore of being a carnivore chuckle rw the benefit to the carnivore of being a carnivore well what 
think is cool and again i am not any type of nutritionist but protein goes a long way right 
we know that herbivores for example really have to spend so much time grazing so much time eating many 
them hibernate they have to make sure that able to access resources all year round and kind of a 
behavior right like very very driven by being able to eat however many tonnes of vegetation per day that 
need to survive whereas carnivores if they get a good highprotein meal they have to do that again for 
a day or two days so they actually are able to spend more time mating spend more time finding 
territories spend more time pooping and dispersing nutrients throughout the forest really really great for them to be able 
take that protein let it sate their appetite and then do all the other things that animals need to 
sc and sleeping yeah a lot of sleeping that gets done chuckle rw and so much sleeping see you 
why i love them so much like sc oh yeah sc sleeping resting laughter sc got it figured out 
just got it made sc right and how do carnivores get along with each other i read somewhere when 
about this episode that carnivores eat other carnivores but do they compete with other carnivores generally different species of 
rw so you bring up a chuckle you bring up a question that has been answered in some ways 
really depends on region and the way that different environments may change over time or might be changing in 
to human activity so for the most part yeah not eating each other right so we typically find carnivores 
each other if i were to just oversimplify because they want to expend too much energy sc yeah rw 
a mountain lion wanted to eat a bear it would have to fight so so hard and nobody has 
for that a little bit lazy and so way easier to find a nest of eggs to find a 
or a very young or weak herbivore to take down than to pick a fight with another big strong 
so pretty much why they do it but not completely unheard for a very very hungry carnivore to come 
a carcass of another one and maybe take a few bites i mean not totally unheard of because also 
and remind me of the other part of your question before i get too far sc oh sorry already 
it laughter sc but okay rw well i had an answer for it so going to get a little 
sc no just rw yeah they sc you know rw they sc why there do carnivores sort of carve 
domains of influence do they like say you can get this kind of like if there are wolves and 
in the same ecosystem if they attack each other do they at least compete for similar resources or is 
an unspoken agreement between them rw right and so where we find a lot of complementarity in these ecosystems 
i think this is so beautiful how nature often just kind of works together like a puzzle right and 
kind of has their own fit in the puzzle for the most part again things are going to be 
different if there is a change in the availability of resources for one carnivore or one herbivore then things 
really get messed up and pretty skewed and where we see some really interesting things happening in ecology give 
an example from my study area in the western great basin so kind of the area where nevada meets 
and the sierras where we have seen an increase in the black bear population over the last thirty years 
very rapid increase in the black bear population and a much slower increase in the mountain lion population rw 
the mountain lion population has remained pretty much stable increasing but not as not as fast of a rate 
black bears and mountain lions typically they are hunting deer they are hunting elk getting all of those herbivores 
seen as gotten more and more black bears that actually started to push mountain lions off of their kills 
when a mountain kills something and kind of stashes it away in a tree seen a black bear one 
a time kind of come in and steal that carcass from the mountain lion sc aha chuckle rw whereas 
they do that so actually seeing when we have collared bear and a collared mountain lion if we look 
our map actually seeing them interacting in space and time actually kind of having a face off over these 
whereas normally bears would just kind of take their fish take their eggs eat all the juniper berries that 
around dig up all their root vegetables and so this is atypical behavior from what we understand about predatortopredator 
and behavior and really really fascinating so a lot of us are questioning it because the climate is changing 
there fewer vegetation options for bears are there more people in this part of nevada and california so that 
restricting bears from going to places where they would normally get their rw really what is it about changing 
the environment and creating this kind of i talked about the perfect puzzle sc yeah rw that carnivals make 
seeing some disruption to that sc is there some relationship between being a carnivore and intelligence in a species 
you need to be a little bit quicker on the ball to survive in this kind of environment rw 
want to make too many generalizations because if we were to talk about what we consider some of the 
intelligent animals on the planet i think the top few would be herbivores we could think of a lot 
big whale species that are noncarnivorous we could think about elephants they are herbivores we can think about mountain 
they might eat some insects but primarily herbivorous but at the same time that predatory nature and the ability 
kind of understand like fear versus opportunity risk versus reward is really unique to apex predators like carnivores and 
i would argue a different kind of intelligence that is inherent in them sc and maybe sharks are an 
of a successful predator that might not be that smart rw there you go yeah there you go i 
have trouble talking about an animal not being smart because i feel like kinda disrespectful you know animals too 
yeah brilliant but exactly sharks are fairly impulsedriven and make a lot of mistakes so that would be a 
example sc but you alluded to the idea that the populations are growing in the united states for black 
for mountain lions is that because getting better at conservation rw yeah i as an ecologist as a conservation 
i love to talk about conservation success stories because often plagued with not working sc yeah rw we can 
about carnivores on the brink of extinction around the world all day long look at tigers look at lions 
at sharks like we were saying but in the united states been a lot of conservation attention to carnivores 
wolves as controversial as they can be wolves grizzly bears black bears polar bears mountain lions done a really 
job of giving them attention putting some policies and legislation in order to protect their habitats and for many 
these species it has worked if you went back years there were very few black bears in a lot 
spaces and been restored to a lot of ecosystems rw in at the end of the obama administration he 
able to take the sorry the louisiana black bear off of the endangered species list and that leaves no 
of black bears on the endangered species list anymore which is tremendous think of another carnivore think of the 
eagle back in the we were plagued with this information about how critically endangered bald eagles were their egg 
were too thin and they able to reproduce successfully and now bald eagles are soaring all over the place 
can go to parts of new york city and possibly spot an eagle really really incredible and had a 
of success sc what is the actual policy that is most helpful here is it just kill them or 
out of their territory or something else rw it depends chuckle typical science response it depends on the region 
depends on the dynamics of the area it depends on the species definitely the endangered species act and the 
species list has been tremendously important a huge piece of legislation that often and oversimplifying but often say anywhere 
this species is found is protected it also means you hunt the species for the most part right if 
the endangered species list it be hunted and that is a huge way this probably sounds really obvious but 
really great way to protect species rw many of these species on the list have become critically endangered because 
overhunting but also habitat destruction so if a forest that we want to turn into a ski resort but 
type of endangered species that lives in that area not going to be able to do as much development 
sometimes any development in those areas but also a lot of kind of tradeoffs for people and the economy 
need to happen if i take the louisiana black bear as an example down south the government actually started 
agricultural workers so farm owners to not farm on their land and to allow the forest to regenerate in 
areas sc okay rw for as long as the louisiana black bear was listed and it works so again 
people losing money losing their livelihoods they were actually getting paid as if they were farming actively they were 
just letting they doing active restoration of the forest but they were just letting their land do whatever it 
naturally leaving bears alone not hunting them and they were able to rebound sc i did a wonderful podcast 
while ago now with joe walston who is a conservationist and he actually had a weirdly optimistic take that 
human beings move into more and more dense urban environments it will become easier and easier to actually preserve 
amounts of natural habitats for wildlife and for different kind of species so he puts it in the language 
if we get past the bottleneck where killing off species too quickly we can imagine a future equilibrium where 
live in harmony with them do you think a realistic kind of prospect rw i absolutely do and i 
talking about it in a kind of different way because i fell into conservation biology and wildlife ecology as 
urbandwelling person always lived in a big city i was born in a big city i never recreated in 
for fun until it became part of my career and so often people will ask me like gosh how 
you live in new york city how can you live in washington and so happy to be able to 
the response like better for the environment in a lot of so urbanization has been some metrics developed to 
that the more urbanized we become as a human society around the globe the more wild area is able 
flourish rw and so a great idea what i find problematic is the way many conservationists and not mentioning 
guest on the show but the way a lot of conservationists kind of will gloss over the social implications 
it right and a lot of the kind of ethics about people who may choose to live rurally or 
particularly tribal lifestyles and not want to be urban so we want to necessarily suggest people like that are 
problem or a part of the problem sc sure rw but if people opt into living an urban lifestyle 
an urban lifestyle is rewarding for them enough job opportunity like we can kind of solve poverty in cities 
offers so much opportunity for conservation to work and fairly quickly just kind of getting off the land pretty 
shows that nature is able to respond really really well and it could be what saves the planet sc 
you seen the pictures of the coyote walking down the streets of chicago that everyone is now down in 
the wildlife moves in pretty quickly yeah rw yeah yeah the bears in yosemite right a protected area in 
yosemite especially this time of year is used to having a lot of visitors and bears are now coming 
of hibernation in parts of the mountains to no visitors so mother bears are able to kind of just 
free with their cubs and just use all different parts of the forest that they able to before all 
animals are so happy right now maybe not the tiger in the bronx zoo who got coronavirus but all 
other ones sc one of the things that joe walston did mention is that historically almost all of the 
conservationists and environmentalists came from cities those are the ones who sort of feel the danger of the landscape 
them disappearing more intently i guess something like that rw so interesting i did not know that and that 
me feel way better about my self sc yeah yeah not just you not just you rae but this 
big set of questions about how regardless of whether in cities or in the country how human beings should 
with these great animals right with whether lions or bears or whatever in your estimation should we sort of 
to rope them off keep them apart and leave them alone or will there always be these kind of 
zones where the occasional black bear taking a dip in pool in their backyard rw yeah this is a 
question and i have strong opinions sc please rw about it and i i guess i will start by 
that so important to me that humans acknowledge where we are and what land on right so even if 
are preaching that we should move towards more urbanization understanding that like right now in washington dc like understanding 
before this was a big city this was a place with bears and lions and wolves and a whole 
community so when we do see a lot of these animals kind of showing back up as the population 
increase as we see them like in the exurban spaces and the suburban spaces on the edges of towns 
cities to really understand that that is naturally and historically where they were meant to be rw the other 
say is that as long as we are responsible i think humans have a huge responsibility towards promoting humanwildlife 
bears are a great example to use when we talk about this because humans attract bears to where we 
if we barbecuing on our backyards if we throwing out trash if we leaving our dog food in the 
on the porch bears that can smell sense from over a mile away necessarily be interested in coming on 
the edge of town to dig in your trash rw so the more responsible people can be at eliminating 
to wildlife again it could be bears but it could also be raccoons it could be the coyotes it 
be the deer if you plant a yummy garden you necessarily be super upset that some herbivore wants to 
and eat it right you are creating human food resources in a place that is easily accessible to an 
the more responsible we can be the less selfish we can be i think the easier find coexistence and 
think the easier find living with increased population sizes of wild animals i often give talks about humanbear coexistence 
the places where i do my research and have people come up to me afterwards and say i have 
bearproof garbage can i make sure to be really responsible in this way in this way but i still 
bears in my rw and say things like do you have a bird feeder do you have a fountain 
a little gurgling water fountain in your things like that are still resources that bears need and especially as 
in the complexity of climate change for example where skewing when resources are available and the predictive nature of 
these animals are going to go for the easiest option especially in places that are their ancestral homes sc 
rw the other thing say is that goal myself included to have a vacation home somewhere so as urban 
we want to be when we are building our vacation homes and our vacation spaces in these beautiful areas 
gorgeous mountains and beautiful forest encroaching on wildlife habitat and so that has to come with the acknowledgement that 
might be there too sc well and also the acknowledgement that they are legitimately dangerous right if we want 
to survive and flourish etcetera and if we are going to have a world where there are overlapping regions 
do we need do at least the people who frequent those overlapping regions need to be better educated in 
to get along on a daytoday basis or literally what you do when you stumble across one while hiking 
yeah absolutely safety is super super important and again it speaks to coexistence i love i just i say 
good things about bears laughter rw i love using them as an example again when we talk about safety 
actually a really nonaggressive species especially if you talk about black bears right sc okay rw like black bears 
a whole bunch of fear but they also want any problems a lot of carnivores like we were saying 
they want to fight they are not interested in expending their energy on fighting much rather rest relax get 
meal hang out sc right rw and so it really takes a lot of triggers for a black bear 
a brown bear for a mountain lion for a wolf to attack you you really have to be provoking 
so just making sure that you can make your presence known if you come into contact with a bear 
back off you look away so you make eye contact with the animal that can be seen as aggressive 
okay rw you look at its feet you look above its head so not making that eye contact you 
back off if you are hiking i always recommend bear spray bear spray is just a great deterrent because 
spray essentially and it is extremely irritating to the eyes chuckle your eyes included and so it is just 
great way to kind of create a barrier between you and the animal so the animal says i want 
kinds of problems and able to just calmly make your escape sc i always see these rules or instructions 
what you see when you encounter bears and they seem completely different if a brown bear or a black 
or a grizzly bear and zero chance going to remember what to do chuckle depending on what kind of 
it is so the advice you just gave is pretty universal you think rw pretty universal and again what 
is that there is really different advice for whether you are encountering a bear or whether you are being 
by a bear if being attacked by a bear there are different sets of advice for what to do 
a black bar encouraged to fight it off if it is a grizzly bear encouraged to curl yourself into 
little ball and play dead until it is done messing with you if a polar bear sorry you might 
make it laughter rw but again sc important advice rw the advice for if you were on a hike 
you see thirty feet ahead of you is a bear that is when you stop in your tracks make 
look either really big or really small back away make eye contact and just slowly leave make sure that 
position yourself as not a threat to the animal not interested in the animal sc okay okay very good 
to know i did have a couple of extra little science questions just about what learned from your studies 
the bears rw sure sc we can basically study them in space and in time it seems to me 
pretty sparsely distributed right not like you said big bear cities is there some knowledge of how they find 
other dating is hard enough in the big city for human beings with all those sort of apps like 
there a procedure by which bears sort of do socialize on those rare occasions rw yeah so in terms 
mating they smell each other so female bears make sure to mark their scent male bears make sure to 
that scent and so they actually just they have such an incredible sense of smell that they smell each 
from really really far away meet up at the right times and then say goodbye forever chuckle sc okay 
and the only times that we might see bears congregate in the same area is if there is some 
resource that they need to fight over so again if you just think of those classic videos you might 
on youtube or on national geographic of bears at a river with spawning salmon and see a number of 
all together not fighting over one salmon so many to go around that they will congregate at the same 
each day get their salmon and then again be in very separate places for the rest of the day 
right and we are here among other things to mention that there is a national geographic special coming out 
week as the same week that this podcast is going to be released called born wild the next generation 
be in it and people can see exactly those images that you say of the bears hunting and hanging 
and so forth rw yeah and the great thing about this show coming out and i wait to see 
my colleagues were up to the other explorers all over the world who are going to be featured in 
show is that as much as i work with sedated bears chuckle when i have my hands on them 
are actually we filmed this in the winter when we were doing a bear den survey so actually working 
newborn cubs and so we never give any kind of drugs to cubs when that little so actually seeing 
bears active adorable cutie pie little baby animals who have never seen the light of day before we take 
out of their den for ten minutes just enough time for us to weigh them measure them sex them 
check their overall health before we put them back with mom so an amazing glimpse into the secret life 
bears but also the secret life of bear biologists and i wait for people to see it chuckle sc 
the bears so antisocial that not even worth sort of studying their social networks like do bears have friends 
enemies and nemeses and frenemies and stuff like that or do they just just keep away from the other 
rw yeah really i mean they are antisocial and people hate it when i say that i think it 
a lot of disappointment again because kind of we as humans are socialized to believe that they are just 
friendly and sweet and always out together and the protagonists of all of our stories but really they if 
pass by a fox in the forest not stopping to say hi chuckle they just keep it moving sc 
you have also this is a good segue also done research in africa on big cats lions in particular 
yes yeah african lions sc and their sociability strategies are completely different which i still am waiting for the 
unified theory of this but meanwhile collect all the data and figure out in what way they are different 
their sociability rw yeah they are so so different the studies that i always did were very similar to 
i was studying bears so i was looking less at their behavior and more at their movement patterns so 
my studies of african lions i was again capturing them putting a gps collar on one or two members 
the pride and really looking at how using the landscape and what landscapes using so if you think of 
huge african savanna a lot of us might want to think that lions are using every square inch of 
savanna but not true actually parts of the savanna that they completely avoid parts that they use all the 
and parts that they just pass through so my work has always been to just understand their movement which 
us understand their ecology and especially how we can protect the most important areas for those lions and if 
kind of landscape development is needed for the human economy where we can best fit that in in order 
still protect lion habitat sc yeah i understand why for conservation and ecology purposes you want to know where 
spend their time but as the physicist i want to know why they spend their time in certain places 
asking a lot of questions to which the answer is just not known but do we understand why lions 
hanging out in certain regions and just pass right by others or avoid them entirely rw yeah we have 
understandings and again every region is different so there is i actually have a colleague who is right now 
that something about the soil types of different parts of the savanna versus other parts that might actually be 
some of this habitat selection preference and a big question but a cool thing about science and a cool 
about ecologists is that one question leads us to another to another if i were to be super general 
course all about food resources and water resources the dry parts of the savanna where no fresh water going 
avoid those areas no herbivores going to the watering holes and so they have to go farther to look 
food but it can be more complex and it can also be seasonal right so in certain seasons lions 
over here in certain seasons lions seem to be more all over the place it really depends and we 
that lion movement and behavior might be different in parts of south africa versus parts of east africa versus 
of central africa rw so what i love about ecology is that we have some kind of basic baseline 
that we can generalize to an entire species but if you take one population one pride you can actually 
dig in and see some differences that then make you question everything sc well i keep coming back to 
social network question because you just mentioned differences and even though there are you studied lions but other kinds 
big cats and as far as my meagre understanding goes their social networks are just entirely different right there 
also very antisocial cats as well as very social ones rw oh yes absolutely so if we if we 
to a different continent and we can look at tigers that are not in these big prides we could 
to north america and look at mountain lions which are solitary or we can even stay in africa where 
about african lions and look at leopards which are on their own unless talking about a female so i 
just truly truly fascinating and i have never studied big cats other than lions so i am not as 
of an expert but it is so fascinating to me how these animal species that could have so much 
common and in a lot of ways do actually behave so so differently from each other sc yeah a 
of contingency and randomness in the evolutionary history that means that some things are selected for they work or 
a lot of things just might be accidents there might not be a reason why right rw yeah one 
the things that i love so much about learning about evolution and how it relates to ecology is that 
much is random right when i was a student i actually studied what we call the neutral theory of 
which is just basically questioning well what if all of this is just happening at complete random and a 
way to question some of the patterns or things that we think are patterns that we see in a 
community like why is this species social and this species we think we can identify some reasons but it 
have just arisen randomly and it just works for now and see how it continues in the future but 
to me that is a way to emphasize why we need conservation because we want to answer some of 
questions in the future we do it if we have these animals sc is so just a last question 
do you see as your hope for future end goal your equilibrium like how should we imagine living harmony 
be too much but at least in a mutually beneficial equilibrium with the big predators that talking about today 
yeah when i think about what i see as the future of conservation i often surprise people because i 
in a lot of human social issues so i truly think that conservation cannot be successful wildlife conservation cannot 
successful unless we eliminate poverty from human societies so so much of what we see as a threat to 
conservation especially at local and regional scales is due in part to the prevalence of poverty in different places 
when i think of a future conservation i think about equity for communities i think about economic infrastructure that 
help alleviate or hopefully eliminate poverty so that we can really have humans in a good enough place so 
we can have the best speakers and the best minds and the best strategies available to protect nature and 
nature to thrive sc a good thing i think that we should all shoot for rae wynngrant thanks so
