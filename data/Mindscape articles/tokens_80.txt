carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and as i said before one 
the major motivations for me personally in doing a podcast project is to be able to explore things other 
what i do for a living mostly physics a little bit of philosophy so the podcast lets me talk 
other scientists neuroscientists biologists chemists and it also lets me go beyond science talked to poker players and movie 
and musicians and so forth so podcast is definitely one of those examples of going well beyond my comfort 
sc ge wang guest is actually a computer scientist officially a computer programmer at stanford university and my comfort 
okay but his specialty is computer programming of music so he builds instruments that make computers into musical instruments 
puts on performances with laptop orchestras things like that ge wang has a famous ted talk where he demonstrates 
iphone ocarina you can actually if you have an iphone go to the app store download an app called 
which will turn your iphone into a musical instrument you need any extra hardware you blow into the microphone 
make beautiful music actually have a demonstration on the podcast today sc however ge wrote a book that was 
about computer programming or musical instruments but about the general idea of design artful design designing anything whether computers 
musical instruments but cups of coffee or pencil boxes or anything like that the general principles that relate form 
function the human needs and the possibilities of the technology or the shapes doing whether music or art or 
design i know nothing about this i think a cool and important topic so we had a great conversation 
this is definitely an example where learning new things i bring no special predilections or preexisting notions to this 
and therefore we had a lot of fun design is everywhere in our lives and thinking about it with 
who is also an expert in computer science and music was a great experience so go music sc ge 
thanks for coming on the mindscape podcast ge wang thanks sean thanks for having me sc now gonna admit 
away that this is going to be one of the more adventurous podcasts that done written a book about 
which is something i know nothing about not like even when i know nothing about things like neuroscience or 
i still have opinions about them and something i even have opinions about so hopefully have a wideranging conversation 
be able to guide me through the rough spots and so forth but start with the fact that in 
sense a computer programmer a computer scientist is that a fair thing to say gw that is a fair 
to say my phd and undergrad were both in computer science even though now an associate professor in the 
department actually in the center for computer research in music and acoustics ccrma or ccrma at stanford sc but 
the music department gw within the music department called a courtesy appointment in computer science so kind of really 
of in both places and neither places i actually know what i am exactly but i think fair to 
a computer scientist sc the best place to be not knowing where you are but you have to get 
know where you are i mean did the computer interest come first or the music interest gw you know 
some point those were both interesting i loved building things and i think the computer science eventually spoke directly 
that i could really realize things that i wanted to see how this works and then i always loved 
as just this sc did you grow up playing instruments gw i grew up playing the accordion at age 
sc wow hardcore gw and then my grandparents got me that and then my parents got me an electric 
for my birthday and that changed my world laughter sc are you one of these i know some people 
an instrument they never played it before and within minutes beautiful music is coming out and i am completely 
opposite of that i know gw i know about beautiful music but i love just playing instruments figuring out 
they actually interact and how they work and yeah some sounds will likely come out if you hand me 
instrument it may not be beautiful sc and at some when did you realize that the computer side of 
could have a musical component gw really towards the end of undergrad i was taking music classes taking computer 
classes and then i took the class at duke it was where i did my undergrad from professor scott 
actually now the vice provost of the arts at duke and i think been a lifelong mentor and i 
this computer music class and i heard music that was just like i hear anywhere else and felt and 
i really hear anywhere else except in the medium of the computer and that fascinated me sc were you 
a computer science major at that point gw yeah i was already computer science major sc okay cool and 
then you go to your phd and help write programming languages and things like that gw yeah so i 
having had that experience with electronic music and computer music undergrad applied to grad school in computer science but 
kind of looking for programs that did computer music and i was very fortunate to find well my advisor 
cook at princeton in computer science but he also was jointly appointed at princeton in music so actually was 
first joint hire across engineering and arts and humanities sc very difficult to do i know yeah gw yeah 
so i ended up working on things like yeah programming language for generating music called chuck and working on 
orchestras sc but writing a programming language that just sounds very hardcore are in there is it an assembly 
how do you write a programming language or do you write it in a different language and then compile 
so chuck was written in c and the way i wrote it was well i took a compiler class 
then i well i followed basically chapter by chapter of this textbook on basically how to make a compiler 
okay gw in programming language by andrew appel who happened to be another professor at princeton at the time 
i knew nothing about making programming language so i literally just followed the textbook but then i deviated when 
needed to and i think i designed it really backwards i designed it backwards i think and i mean 
in a good way in that i kind of wrote down on paper the kind of code i wanted 
write and i wanted to get the kind of music i want so i kind of said do i 
this thing to look and now i went back and see if i can actually do it by writing 
to kind of implement sc are you telling me that form follows function laughter gw sometimes yes form often 
function sometimes function follows form in a weird way sc right who was the guy who said that the 
time sc it was american architect louis sullivan sc louis sullivan okay gw yes sc yeah and of course 
to make a point but in reality like you say there are two things form and function that go 
and forth and so is it safe to say that designing this computer programming language is one of the 
ways you came into contact with that principle gw yeah i mean i really think too intentionally and consciously 
design at the time i just wanted to build things it was actually my advisor perry cook who said 
cryptic thing to me and said know ge whatever you make whatever you do do it with and i 
like i have no idea what that means sc one ever told me that before computer science gw right 
but it oddly made sense and perry still denies that ever said this he remember he actually said this 
me but i was like this completely changed the way i do things is things are not just pure 
things we are not purely functional creatures but we you say that you know anything about design but i 
beg to differ and i think we all have and cannot help but make aesthetic judgments on sc sure 
not just pleasing but beautiful truthful just and just plain awesome these are all i think aesthetic judgments sc 
good i mean i wanna get into that at some point but let me just back up a little 
because despite being a computer scientist despite having an appointment in music gw yes sc you write a book 
computer music computer music in there but you you took grander palette right you aimed for bigger fish gw 
so i so artful design well it took me three years to write it and i still know exactly 
about at least or any more i thought i did it has a lot of computer music in there 
i think it tries to address three questions and i would say they are what is the nature of 
and the meaning it holds in human life what does it mean to design well and to design ethically 
then how can this shaping of technology reflect our values as human beings so those are the kind of 
broader questions i try to tackle in artful design sc yeah these a pretty big questions gw yeah sc 
lot of very interdisciplinary and also very grand but like you say everyone has some kind of design sense 
gw yes sc like i say for scientists sometimes degrading philosophy i always tell them look you not do 
you can do it well or you could do it badly and if not educated then maybe you do 
badly then maybe design is the same way gw i love that i think i personally think absolutely right 
that just i think design is really you have an outcome or something in mind and you go about 
intentionally shaping or changing things to kind of achieve that outcome kind of putting the pieces together and making 
fit to actually get at some result or for a certain purpose and when you do that designing sc 
at what point did you go you have been designing of course computer programming languages and get into actual 
instruments and orchestras and so forth but what is it that made you think that the book you should 
should be about the idea of design rather than about these more specific examples of it gw a good 
i think a couple of things for one i think i was realizing what i was doing is like 
like art but also not like engineering exactly and not like art exactly right it embodies engineering precision you 
need to really get to the nuts and bolts of how you program or how you do software engineering 
how certain technique or technology actually works sc yeah and you build hardware things as well right gw from 
to time mostly a software guy but sometimes i dabble in hardware as well and like art a certain 
you can definitely bring into the things you engineer not just in how it looks but kind of how 
actually works and does the way of working actually reflect something you wanted to reflect these more i think 
and intangible qualities of something that we clearly care about if you just look at buildings right sc right 
people design buildings and if we just cared about the function all be content living in sc yeah gw 
clearly not so i think that we know to do think about buildings in that way but i think 
it comes to things like software tools games social experiences these i think just learning to think more aesthetically 
these things sc it reminds me a little bit i interviewed scott derrickson movie director for the podcast and 
was remarking to him that very happy with books and words and pages and also equations and figures and 
physicsy things so i could imagine in an alternate life being like a movie screenwriter or novelist or something 
that i imagine being a director because a million other things you have to worry about like the personalities 
the actors but also the design of the sets and the costumes and everything and he said which is 
of the obvious answer but what he likes he likes the fact that a little bit of everything involved 
it sounds like you were drawn to the fact that you were computer programming but in a way that 
that it was music and instruments and so forth design just became a necessary element pretty obviously gw yeah 
think right and i felt like design is really this universal thing that we all do but only more 
times do we think about design as kind of a discipline or a thing onto itself but i think 
designed we help but design but i well like anything else also possible to do well or do poorly 
right gw and really interested in how we can think about doing it well or doing it better sc 
archimedes or leonardo were gw yes sc even if they have called themselves that gw right sc is it 
or we just fooling ourselves to think that there is a separate discipline called design right we design so 
different things from music to teapots right are there common principles there gw a wonderful question i like to 
that the design be its own actually separate discipline actually i think just something that all of us do 
a certain universality i think that actually does pervade design really everywhere in artful design i think i try 
offer a few of them one is this idea that in looking at the motivation design is all about 
like what are you trying to do and then how are you gonna go about doing it and i 
also add why would you wanna do that so all these different dimensions that i think common to any 
and then part of this why i break it down into means versus ends gw and what i mean 
that is means as in means to an end i do this because i wanna achieve some of the 
gonna make this thing to open a can for so a means to an end but an end in 
the other side are kind of the more intrinsically interesting or valuable or beautiful things about a design form 
fit into that sc this is the idea we wanna all live in warehouses we gw exactly sc live 
an aesthetically pleasing space gw yeah aesthetically pleasing but also things with meaning buildings just pleasing great when they 
right gw but also buildings can serve as kind of symbols can serve as meaning for the people or 
the city that in and also i think a certain well for lack of a better word truth that 
can get at when we actually design things sc okay gw something that reflects who we are in kind 
our values and i think that for me is all kind of in this aesthetic dimension of design so 
is certainly this idea that make things look and feel but i think it actually goes much deeper than 
and that we is the even if building a tool is the tool making lives better does it speak 
your wellbeing and what are the values actually at play here sc yeah i think that this i mean 
i said since not an expert and i have no prior experience to the formal aspects of this way 
thinking i was trying to struggle with how to even grasp what the essence of design is supposed to 
there is an aesthetic component obviously but not just hanging art on your wall it is this functional aspect 
things right and so at the trivial level there is this marriage between doing things or having things done 
purpose and having them aesthetically pleasing but what pointing at is that not sure if another dimension or an 
movement in the same direction of meaningfulness and some connection with what it means to be human is reflective 
the best design gw i think exactly right i think this meaning it actually a principle in the book 
actually i was talking about ai and automation and i think the principles are twopart one it says that 
can be automated should be automated except in cases where if something cannot be meaningfully automated it should not 
automated so give you an example sc meaningfully automated yeah an example gw well for example this act of 
to play i we all like playing hopefully and to play i it does not matter how well i 
i just wanna play and i ever want that automated the whole point of playing is to do it 
right sc right you wanna build a computer program to play your video games for you gw exactly and 
a lot of things that are well experiential for example meaningful for us to do and it certainly i 
have a program or robot play in my place but the point of that possible but not meaningful and 
some level i think for all the automation coming into our world with technology i think humans at some 
still have to be the arbiters of meaning we have to determine what is meaningful to do and what 
we wanna do and that gets back to this question of intrinsically interesting about certain activities sc well good 
we have time here so unpack this a little bit because had philosophers on the podcast and will and 
of them alex rosenberg who i recently talked to kind of is skeptical about the idea of meaning at 
but i think an extremist on one side so go to the other side what do you mean meaning 
is is it just care about or is there something deeper do you personally delve into the philosophical literature 
thinking about these things gw not meaning per se but i do delve into some philosophical literature i think 
is really like for me actually not simplistic but simple in the sense that i think it is what 
value sc okay gw the meaning if meaningful to you that means you find some value and i would 
a more inwardly rewarding kind of a value sc okay gw the meaning sc so rather than more bling 
money or whatever like your soul gw right not the gw exactly more like your soul and play for 
i think is a good example of this it matters to me it may not matter to anybody else 
the value of play is so fundamental to something that speaks to this value of play is meaningful to 
in that sense so i sc and it is interesting to think about why play exists why through the 
of natural selection this came to be i have cats i grew up with dogs certainly other animals are 
playful in their own right does it serve some function or is that is that is it just an 
of other things that are useful gw well i have thought about that a lot i have no clear 
on that but it leads me to think about other things like food and eating i think a related 
to play like eating on one hand very functional we eat so we sustain ourselves so we die but 
we are at a point where we also eat for its sheer enjoyment and i think there and one 
we find we actually have this dual purpose of one is very functional one is very aesthetic and we 
spent a lot of time and energy thinking about and going about making food making sure there is food 
really cooking as an art sc right gw so sometimes i wonder where aesthetics actually come from the aesthetic 
play the aesthetic of food the aesthetic of really of finding these beautiful or truthful and do they arise 
evolutionarily more functional things i not an expert in this so i know if i can offer a good 
on this but i think about this all the time is that like where does remarkable to me that 
can experience things period and remarkable that we find things beautiful sc and even if we knew the answer 
the question of where it came from was it the fact gw exactly right sc that we find that 
and beautiful right i often end some of my talks when i talk about the big picture the book 
i wrote a lot of deflationary messages bags of atoms we live for a very short period of time 
compared to the universe but then you show a picture of the universe the hubble ultradeep field with all 
galaxies and the point is we took that picture right like we decided to spend millions and millions of 
to take that picture and not helping us feed ourselves or anything like that we just we had the 
and the interest in the beauty that was brought out by that gw thats exactly right and fundamental research 
theoretical physics for me i think of it more or less like science and engineering but more as really 
the humanities in a way right really getting at some fundamental truth about the world like with a capital 
or what is there sc yeah gw and also our place in it and so human to want to 
like that just a little bit sc yeah i completely agree tell my colleagues saying this but it does 
a lot to do with the humanity driven by curiosity not by immediate practical interest but as you point 
even the areas of discipline where you study that are driven by need to be practical interest engineering biology 
they still have this aesthetic component so maybe come back ground ourselves a little bit you got here through 
journey of music and computers and so forth so tell us about some of the design done in that 
yourself the making of different kinds of musical instruments orchestras and so on gw sure i make tools toys 
and social experiences with technology for musical purposes and i could give you a demo of one if you 
sc we would love a demo that would be awesome gw so this is an app i designed ten 
ago i started a company called smule still around sc okay gw a way to make music socially together 
people i stepped down five years ago but smule is still going strong i designed this as part of 
ten years ago and ocarina and an app for your phone you play it by blowing into it so 
okay before you play it is it coming out of that speaker gw yes sc okay so we should 
that in front of the microphone gw okay so how directional is this sc pretty darn directional so yeah 
okay so try that sc there you go gw you may have to edit you may edit part of 
app sc not really the same gonna all the message this is here gw okay sc yeah brought more 
than any other podcast guest had so far so this is awesome gw so holding my phone but not 
the usual way holding it like a sandwich and blowing into the mic from the bottom and using my 
on the screen to there are these four circles that expands contract when i press down on them and 
control pitch accelerometer in the iphone controls vibrato so if i hold the phone flat versus tilting it downward 
you can play all kinds of little ditty with this gw and a very physical use of the phone 
and you no hardware enhancement to the phone you put a pick up or anything like that how does 
on the phone get registered gw so i am blowing into the microphone in there there is actually a 
software program tracking the strength of how hard blowing into the microphone when you blow in the microphone not 
do it here but we get and from there you can just basically do an envelope follower and see 
much roughly how much energy is in there and then you map that to sound being generated on the 
sc okay gw and pretty much it and then mapping the interaction from the multitouch and the accelerometer to 
parameters in the sound synthesis sc and this is called ocarina it is very much like that existing instrument 
the ocarina gw right this is an instrument been around in various forms for thousands of years actually and 
of the more i would say one of the simpler instruments to start playing the interaction really is you 
into it and there is a few holes you can hold down to control pitch and to answer your 
question yeah this is no addons to the phone the part of the design was say can we design 
that required constraints that require no additional components and in a way and i talked about this in artful 
this is insideout design this is actually a function following a bit of form and the form in this 
being your phone sc yeah you have a phone what are you gonna do with it gw gonna do 
it what are the things on the phone and what makes sense and if you go through this exercise 
well a piano is like a little too big and the interaction you have the keys you have eightyeight 
or guitar or drums these are but a four hole english pendant ocarina is about the same size as 
iphone and also the complexity of interaction is comparable sc about the same yeah gw so that was kind 
a perfect match gw a perfect match and so this backwards say we designed backwards from really the end 
and we design backwards from the medium in this case the medium was the iphone and all the things 
sc but you had in mind number one you wanted to make a musical instrument gw yes sc and 
two you had an iphone available and our listeners can go download this on the app store gw yeah 
is available look for smule ocarina and actually another component to ocarina as well sc okay gw this is 
social component a lot of visualization and here actually seeing this double helix graphics coming out of actually southern 
playing ode to joy someone who calls himself a belted biscuit sc belted biscuit a classic gw who is 
person i have no idea a classic sc an undiscovered genius out there probably across the street you know 
physical space matter gw yeah but you know roughly where coming from amazing grace from london adam sc okay 
and all you know who these people are the app is designed for you not a weird social network 
so all doing is other people are playing and we can listen to whatever playing gw yeah all it 
sc when i play it that means they can listen to me i might feel bad gw when the 
is kind of taking in these little snippets and then a few interactions and sending those up to basically 
server and then when listening they kind of randomly get served something in the recent past sc okay so 
quite in real time gw not quite in realtime no sc so this morning when i was just trying 
make it work at all and not really completely succeeding that is not probably sent today anywhere gw that 
was not but you can turn this feature on and off but kind of anonymous listening to say in 
social system identity matter about physicality blowing to the phone to make music and about this little sense of 
you have with someone if like countdown coming from you would be like is that and the app gives 
no answers on that but it does want you to ask that question sc yeah cool and is there 
is probably not a fair question is there followup do you do people make orchestras do they join together 
not in this app no followup and i think this i think of it as a logical end here 
is not a tool to study it cannot help people make music for me not sc not a social 
gw not a social network a place to feel a little connected with and the end and so that 
that sense to me it goes back to this like an end in itself i just want people to 
connected not here to serve another purpose beyond that sc what i thought was a really good point about 
fact that say two hundred years ago but maybe even more recently than that what families would do in 
leisure time is create music together gw right sc and we almost never do that anymore we listen to 
and maybe just so easy to put it on the record or play spotify or whatever or pandora i 
mention pandora my my podcast appears on pandora now maybe too easy or maybe a skill are we just 
to really really good musicians so far that embarrassed about our own skills that you wanna bring it back 
ability to get late at night instead of watching tv we can play music together gw yeah i think 
goes back to this question of meaning and values i think musicmaking to me is a value something that 
think does a person good and i know why and i think probably a lot of different factors changed 
relationship with music making technology really is the thing changed it over the last one hundred years before household 
to get music there was no broadcast there was no internet there was no recording you had to be 
music you had to listen to music where it was made and if you look throughout human history never 
a civilization or a culture been without either music or dance so music has been with us and of 
we find flutes made out of bear femur and human bones even kind of dating tens of thousands of 
so music has really been with us but only really in the last years music has for better gw 
for the better it can be recorded it can be disseminated over long distances and then we can capture 
musicians that really speak to us and always have their sound and i think a good part of it 
a possible side effect and a possible downside is that we might be making less music than ever before 
maybe i know i refuse to believe because we hear people that are so amazing that we are intimidated 
think sometimes they even inspire us but i think really just now we just have so much that we 
do that so much easier just to fire up a video game which i do and i love playing 
to just watch a streaming video or whatnot and all things i love to do sc yeah but the 
out there with a lot of music and i know i get your desire to not think that because 
by people who are better than us but i bet that a lot of people who used to think 
could sing and now we can listen to aretha franklin and freddie mercury and go maybe not as good 
or playing the piano or whatever gw well i think that it gets back to well to this idea 
think of the intrinsic value of making music again i think play comes back not making music to be 
making music because it enriches you and just to learn amateur musicianship was a good thing i hope it 
is to learn an instrument just because you wanna learn and i think for this your intrinsic worth of 
how to play the piano play the guitar and if you have a favorite song you wanna know to 
that song are you doing this so you can be on stage performing for thousands of people not necessarily 
think that could good too but i think if you take everything else away just making music for yourself 
really awesome about that sc i would say the same thing about making art doing paintings this is something 
most people do but not that hard you can paint badly compared to an expert but okay the activity 
can be rewarding gw exactly sc so do you think that the kinds of things designing will help bring 
the actual personal creation of music to people gw the hope is to help people realize that this intrinsic 
to doing this and i think what they do i know for example i think the apps that things 
do well certainly the apps on mobile phones they are i think of them as educational tools at all 
think of them more as personal expression windows for people to you wanna lower the sense of inhibition and 
people to feel this joy of making music to play in all sense of the word play an instrument 
also just play gw the things like laptop orchestra and things like chuck the programming language for music those 
i think for perhaps a different audience even though they overlap somewhat and those are more i think on 
different side of research what kind of tools can be built and what kind of instruments can be built 
orchestras of laptops and humans sc yeah tell us a little bit about the laptop orchestra project was there 
than one or is there a laptop orchestra gw yes now there are more than i think i would 
probably more than seventy worldwide and most of them in academic institutions the first one of its kind really 
at princeton and while i was a grad student this was started by my advisor perry cook and dan 
still a music professor at princeton and been exploring how we can design instruments but also design instruments that 
some of the things we love about traditional instruments one how they emanate sound if you were to play 
violin in a room the sound naturally come from a pa system it comes from the artifact itself and 
certain sense of presence and intimacy that comes with that kind of sound sc different concert halls have different 
right different sounds gw a feeling exactly and so been looking at different ways to build speakers that capture 
sonic intimacy and this eventually led to the laptop orchestra and this started at princeton as the princeton laptop 
or plork in i graduated in and started at stanford and then started the stanford laptop orchestra or slork 
the idea is that in the laptop orchestra we have computers of course we have humans and also we 
these hemispherical speaker arrays now they look like the dome of and actually made out of diameter wooden salad 
with holes drilled into them and we put speaker drivers in them and the whole idea is that we 
each salad bowl with a computer so that the sound that the computer is making comes out locally to 
being played and then you have that multiplied by and you can really have have an orchestra that can 
a wall of sound sc but the physical playing is tapping on the keyboard of the laptops gw it 
today designed more than probably two hundred different instruments and some of them are tapping on the keyboard uses 
mouse some of them or using things wiimotes game controllers used this thing called the gametrak which is like 
it was made to track your hand in space it was made for golf games sc oh okay gw 
so tethered to this base on the ground and you have to wear gloves that the ends of the 
are attached to and that so it gives you the six degrees of freedom for where your two hands 
sc a little bit theremin like gw you can make theremins out of it yeah so you can basically 
can move your arms around your hands around and you can translate this gesture into sonic gestures so anything 
can get our hands on can become a potential interface for music making in the laptop orchestra sc now 
i ask another unfair question is the music good gw sometimes laughter gw been trying to make good music 
always trying to make music interesting that kind of challenges or asks questions about how we make music this 
being about a different way you think about creating an instrument or performing music and certainly to the best 
our ability we try to make music good but the music that might be a matter of taste as 
sc well or is it just first remarkable you can do it at all and down the road people 
start putting it to more artistic uses gw i think definitely exploratory yeah definitely in the early stages but 
of that i think has to do with the medium of the computer itself as a thing you make 
out of and perry had these principles when designing computer music instruments often making the piece not the instrument 
and foremost sc oh okay gw you kind of figuring out what you want the piece to sound like 
it sounds exhausting laughter every time you wanna make a new musical piece you have to make new instruments 
actually exactly what we end up doing is that we have like something like two hundred instruments now on 
orchestra we have just about that many pieces and we generally create general purpose instruments that can be used 
a number of pieces but we would think about what is the specific piece and what is exactly the 
instrument that we can craft to play that piece and so we have these very specialized instruments and i 
that speaks to the medium of the computer possible in a matter of days sometimes to actually have an 
and actually prototype an instrument and you have a piece of music that never heard before sc and this 
not supposed to bring music making into living rooms this is just exploring a new kind of music that 
could imagine playing in a concert hall and people coming and listening to gw i think right yeah this 
a different way of thinking about how to make music this less about selfexpression something like ocarina is trying 
do this more like researching how we make music together with this new medium of the computer sc have 
there been collaborations with professional composers or musicians gw yeah plork has done quite a few of these and 
has played with zakir hussain the amazing tabla player and so percussion and done some amazing things sc do 
travel is there a tour gw i know if a tour there was definitely a few concerts a few 
ago that featured them and really kind i think born out of curiosity like how do what kind of 
are possible the medium is very different so you probably get different instruments out of the medium and because 
instruments are different the gonna be different and the way you perform so this cascading cause and effect yeah 
at every stage sc right gw you design attributed to marshall mcluhan that shape our tools and thereafter they 
so the laptop orchestra is that by the shaping things in every stage the end result is gonna be 
really different sc well i was gonna ask about the technological aspect here the role of technology it seems 
technological if making a laptop orchestra or an ocarina out of an iphone but in some sense every musical 
is technology right been technology all along in what sense are we exploring new music spaces because the technology 
allowing us to do that gw well the medium first of all exactly right every instrument is a technology 
vibrating strings or vibrating columns of air i think for computer music exploring the very medium of the computer 
and the thing that sets that apart perhaps from other mediums is that well one programmable and two in 
well i think of traditional instruments really like form follows physics right sc yes exactly gw but with the 
for better or for worse have this completely compartmentalized way of thinking about instruments like the input what do 
want it to sound like those can be very different and then a mapping layer in the middle then 
map the input to the output and you can change the input without changing the output vice versa in 
this always work well and you want it really design everything in a we call it in a more 
kind of a way but kind of the difference is that this medium is something that for better or 
worse frees you from the physics the physical kind of nature of things and into rules that are more 
in a more virtual realm i suppose sc yeah interested also in how much we can formalize this right 
you can do so now that you have a when i was a i was an undergraduate this was 
first laptop era the when ibm pcs and macs were everywhere and i definitely programmed our little ibm pcs 
make i would call them noises more than musical sounds but a very natural thing to do so then 
much after done that can you step back and say here are the i know mentioned laws of technology 
intellectualized is this versus just kind of playing around and learning things gw well a great question and it 
goes broader to this whole idea of what principles can we capture about designing things in general more specifically 
this is where design and really computer music design well not entirely formalizable but i think more formalizable than 
if you say it i think some middle ground and if i were to go back to aristotle he 
something like the following should not expect more precision than a topic naturally sc right actually i love that 
in your book i was exactly thinking that should is there the right answer to design but aristotle was 
not the kind of thing you should be looking gw i think sometimes valuable to say things generally or 
a broad sense and so design is really in this tacit dimension in between engineering precision and really full 
to kind i think there are things we can say but there are more lenses to think with than 
to follow sc right gw and so perry for example in computer music design had these principles first one 
instant music subtlety later sc okay good gw a way to think a great way to think about how 
design an instrument and he had a coffee mug that makes music and you really pick it up and 
sensors on it enable you to start making sound and music immediately but over time you can learn his 
sc the artful way to drink your coffee gw exactly so i think the principles in artful design really 
inspired by principle which to me said that there is a level of specificity in precision but only to 
extent it makes sense and if we expect too much if we try to formalize it too much it 
loses something of its essence sc i should mention that there are a lot of principles in your book 
oh yes sc not like three principles laughter gw true sc at the end of the book it closes 
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten pages of principles with fifteen principles per page so 
lot of principles it is hard to remember do you remember all these laughter gw no laughter but i 
when a situation arises sometimes a way to think about it it tell you what to do but it 
you the principle of automation it says that there is this membrane we can look for beyond which it 
sense to automate and on the other side we should really be confident about what we need to automate 
what we ought not automate and i so design is as much of how to automate or how not 
as it is figuring out where that little boundary is and i think really a responsibility of the designer 
well sc have you worked on the automation of the composing of the music do we have artificial intelligence 
scores for the laptop orchestra gw occasionally we have had algorithmic components and generative components i think still a 
open problem but also goes back to the question of meanings like do we wanna do and if i 
i remember this conversation i had heading to grad school and this is before i i was on my 
to princeton and someone asked me you doing in grad and like going to computer science but really doing 
and like what do you wanna and like wanna write a program for the computer to generate to make 
yeah gw right and that person asked me the sc terrible question gw and i was like i have 
answer for and so instead of actually working sc i am sorry it is actually a very good question 
comes in a terrible place gw a terrible question a but i think it really changed the way i 
about things and i am really glad that person asked it i could not answer that i think the 
realized so if instead of actually trying to build the most amazing algorithmic composition system i want to make 
tool with which others can actually get their hands dirty and build things themselves and if they wanna make 
algorithmic composition system they can use chuck the programming language to do it so i have kind of taken 
step back and designed something like framed it completely sc more facing yeah gw a framing issue sc it 
me a little bit of in chess and go artificial intelligence not only is better than the best humans 
comes up with new strategies i wonder if someday a much harder problem whether artificial intelligences be playing music 
ways that humans never thought of or kinds of compositions we yet hit on gw i think it was 
in chapter i think a fellow colleague at stanford actually i capture this moment she asked me we have 
musicians really ai that play and i said mean as well as like and a philosopher so i gave 
a kind of tongue in cheek answer which i happen to believe which was think the day we have 
musicians have that day when we have robot laughter gw right i think and she said so that means 
maybe on that day the ai will have understood something more subtly human and i think right like i 
what that really means but i think robots need to it again comes out to the question of meaning 
sc well even in the very most basic kind of pattern recognition tasks which computers are getting very good 
still really easy to fool them just by putting things outside of their normal context right gw right sc 
just saw this morning for some reason someone showing a photograph of a bus on a road and you 
the computer what it is and it says a then you just in photoshop rotate the bus and ninety 
and it says now a gw correct sc it say a bus in ninety degrees it has no background 
for that gw yeah and some things i mean for things like go or chess and image recognition there 
kind of what might be considered correct answers and there are a lot of things i think in life 
we value to have no correct answers like art music there are things that just problems to be solved 
much but things that we clearly care about sc you wanna do gw you wanna do right sc right 
maybe this is not a perfect segue but you wrote a book and number one a book you write 
opera you write a musical piece sc so you chose to write a book a conscious decision and secondly 
graphic book but not mostly hand drawn but photographs and overlaid text and so forth and i noticed on 
cover page on the title page it says that you ge wang are the author and designer of the 
gw right sc so what made you think that a book was the right way to do this after 
so much sound in your work and there is no sound in the book and then what made you 
that this graphic way of doing it was the right thing gw a great question i am still wondering 
sometimes myself but really glad i did it this way as a photo comic book and well i think 
book about design so i felt like i really wanted to very clearly and intentionally design it and the 
think design is really how you connect the medium to the message and it absolutely changes how you write 
book so actually i started writing what i thought would be a more conventional book sc yeah three hundred 
of words and text sell gw yeah i was like gonna be great with some and i thought actually 
have a lot of photos so i was like it should have more photos and figures than and then 
was like if some things easier to talk about if talked about not so formally but also with visual 
and also more of kind of a conversation what if the pencil bag could these things i think about 
books that i grew up with including the adventures of tintin in chinese by the way i was born 
beijing and i i grew up really reading tintin and then i was like if half the book was 
comic gw at that point i was like know sc so yeah do that once you say that yeah 
so and then the whole then it was this commitment to just like is this book really about and 
that sc and it seems to fit the idea that what your offering is not the single grand unified 
to what design is but more of an invitation and a conversation and a set of ideas that work 
in interesting ways right gw thats the hope yes and the aim yeah sc i mean having pictures of 
in the book talking to us using thought bubbles and speech balloons invites a conversational kind of response to 
book gw yes i think i wanted to make it feel like a kind of a facetoface conversation and 
also wanna feel like there for you through this inferno of design and kind and also i think a 
to kind of offer certain truths in a more informal way sc yeah and a little more accessible gw 
accessible yeah sc anyone who sees not a graphic novel not a a graphic text comic book do you 
call it a comic book gw i i just call it a comic book yeah sc photo comic book 
gw photo comic book sc kind of an interesting genre these days i interviewed clifford johnson who is a 
a string theorist who did a graphic novel based on physics and string theory and been these famous examples 
graphic novels about philosophy history and so forth a growing genre it sounds like gw i think so i 
comic books and one thing more i can say about the fact that this is a photo comic book 
than a drawn comic book is that for me design may reach for the sublime and the subtitles like 
and search and supply may try to reach for the transcendent but i think feet must be grounded in 
life and i think the photo aspect is to say this you have to parson this extra aesthetic layer 
how stylistically drawn but rather to say this i mean it has own aesthetic of course but these moments 
i think very different for a comic book of spiderman i prefer it to be drawn fictional and that 
my mind a different place to go but aesthetically if not drawn but photographs be very strange if the 
comics were photo comics then be wondering acting as spiderman under the mask and you kind of start thinking 
these but here nonfiction sc right and you want it to be gw i want it to be grounded 
you want it to be real so everything describing is a thing you can take a picture of gw 
sc right and since an author kinda tempted now to write a more graphic comicbooky physics book but you 
the designer of the book how does it work what is the actual process what program are you using 
make these pages gw i think i horrified pretty much everyone that discover how i actually did this i 
this in an old version of omnigraffle which is an outlining program i was using since grad school to 
figures for my papers and i got sc nothing like familiarity when it comes to technology right gw nothing 
familiarity yeah so every page in the book and of which there are and many many pages that never 
it into the final book and each one of those is a separate file in omnigraffle and learned to 
a lot of these little tools of commonly used speech bubbles and other things if i can incorporate images 
this kind and i pull up those pages when i need to make a page and i think i 
at least after a year or two i got pretty fast at doing this and it really felt like 
is yeah it feels good sc i mean maybe this is an impolitic question but what does stanford think 
this the university not the press gw i think i know i hope they like it so far people 
really supported me actually this book was supported by both the school of engineering and the school of humanities 
sciences which to me is i felt like symbolically awesome this is a book that is at these intersections 
one or the other but an other sc right right and was it very different in your personal experience 
the sense that been doing so much music and now you are being a visual artist in some sense 
always been drawn to the visual arts and also really the combination of the audio and the visual and 
interactive and always taken photographs so just kind of a hobbyist amateur photographer i guess sc just the audience 
is an audio podcast you see it but way beyond just a set of pictures of you talking with 
graphs i mean you really obviously put a tremendous amount of effort into the design in terms of background 
and fonts and angles and things like that so it been a lot of fun gw it was a 
of fun it was a ton of work and there are over one thousand six hundred photos in the 
one thousand three hundred of which i either took or a few of them i generated and there are 
a few drawings in there and the others came from public domain creative commons and shoutout sc i rely 
wikimedia when i write my books gw so good laughter sc and it helps in your other design work 
for the audio stuff you also care about the visual presentation right all a part you emphasize the human 
of design and visual creatures as much as anything else gw yeah i think trying i think trying for 
to speak to all as kind of all that we are visual creatures we are creatures that care about 
that have a sense of goodness and justice and all of these things and so whatever those things are 
make us who we are i think design has this potential to address at least and they aggregate hopefully 
of that sc and even an ethical dimension where do ethics and morality come in to this discussion gw 
for me i think of design as like what is the function of the thing and then what is 
else beyond the function of the thing ethics fall for me into well strange to say it falls into 
more of the aesthetic dimension of design sc okay gw if we think of design as simply like what 
the pragmatics and what are the aesthetics and as in aesthetics is everything beyond the sheer functionality and for 
i think the ethical dimension of design is well i think the argument from the book goes is all 
choices really just making this cascading series of decisions about what to build how you build it and who 
and all of these and if all about choices then these decisions they have implications for people that use 
the users and if the case then yeah making decisions as engineers as designers well tantamount to actually taking 
anywhere else in life if we believe that then we as designers and engineers be held to the same 
ethical framework as we would anywhere else and so the argument and then the next part of the argument 
to say but just is no recipe to be moral or ethical and in sc at least we agree 
what right one is gw exactly and i think actually that we agree is why we have ethics is 
values come into conflict and we gotta try our best to apply different lenses to this to see how 
can what does that even mean to resolve it right sc so in some senses like we said about 
earlier you not do it you can do it badly or you can do it well and likewise you 
to have ethical dimensions of your work when designing things you can just pay attention to them or not 
exactly right and first law of laws of technology neither good or bad nor is it right and sc 
it has an effect gw and it has an effect and you can not pay attention to it but 
mean it have an effect nor does it mean free from responsibility you a company say we built this 
however people use it is not our sc not thinking about any specific companies laughter gw no not any 
companies laughter sc certainly physicists historically have done that we did the atomic bomb and chemists and doctors these 
are facing up against the same thing recording this only a week or two after it was announced that 
claims to have genetically engineered a baby and science there obviously but clearly an ethical dimension as well gw 
so i think for engineers i think to really be not just capable engineers but actually human engineers that 
you have to consider all of these dimensions and if you build something useful that makes money but exploited 
or done harm in the process i think the thing is aesthetic not beautiful not truthful and the other 
i will say is i think the world right now currently thinks of ethics largely as this kind of 
on technology but i think i wanna offer an additional way to look at it and i agree that 
should be constraints but what of ethics is really values and what if those values are not the leash 
the foundation of what you make in the first place like that should inform what you build how you 
it and much more proactive than to say built this thing how can we make sure it does no 
okay gw at the end of the day do no evil is a rather low bar laughter sc i 
a terrible thought to think like i can do all this cool stuff if it for those pesky right 
right but if you think about it in the other direction like what are my values what are things 
find awesome and why do i find the awesome and then you can get so excited about building something 
kind and the ethical considerations are kind of built in from the getgo and not as this checkpoint that 
have just like aesthetics you an aesthetic is not something you can slap on at the end nor is 
some module you install into your system just to make it ethical suddenly it work like that sc do 
different do they come to your teaching at stanford when you talk to your students is this part of 
course on design gw absolutely so started using artful design as a textbook and in fact at some level 
think it was written as a textbook a very strange textbook sc no exercises i see any problem sets 
there are no problem sets and there are what i call etudes kind of sc true gw that people 
try to do yeah right not problem sets but they do try to put some of the ideas into 
and designed a new course in this coming winter quarter in called design that understands us and in this 
actually gonna look at the shaping of technology but really in this full broad spectrum broad perspective way and 
here gonna bring to bear really the aesthetic dimension the ethical dimension i wanna look at everything from social 
to artificial intelligence to instruments to toys to games to really anything that we find in our everyday lives 
you one of the things i mean maybe to close this up maybe this is a good final topic 
title is artful design the title of the book but then a subtitle in search of the and sublime 
in a different color and underlined and then since designing it these are not random choices right why is 
the word you chose there gw i think it reflects a certain optimism that as builders as engineers and 
itself is something that can be more than a problem that it can be something that is beautiful truthful 
be just can be ethical and i think when you talk about those things really talking about kind of 
closer to the transcendent and for me the sublime is kind of this window into looking at the transcendent 
think you were talking earlier about how at the end of your books we are just kind basically just 
molecules and these insignificant things in this rather unremarkable in the grand scheme of things rock and sc yeah 
part of our solar system in this arm of this one of hundreds of billions of galaxies and beyond 
who knows out there and i think you know more than i do but we sc none of us 
very much gw none of us know very much but yet nonzero we exist and if you think about 
small we are but also that actually here and we are experiencing things i find that to be miraculous 
that gives when i think about that sublime because it reflects a certain truth a truth that i also 
incredibly beautiful sc well i i mean how careful should we be because using words like sublime and transcendent 
miraculous that are often associated with something beyond the natural world are you mean to imply that or are 
just taking it as part of the human condition gw the human condition sc we have this inner feeling 
is hard to articulate but we feel it right gw i think sublime for me is that the natural 
is that is that this just insane like why do why are a truth out there that we clearly 
not fully understand we even know how to frame it perhaps why are we do not understand how we 
into being or if a purpose and and i think the universe is preposterous to quote in a really 
terrifying but also in just an exquisitely amazing and beautiful way and i think actually the natural sublime is 
in front of this huge canyon and you feel this both a sense of awe and this twinge of 
right well i think if you think about the universe for example yeah i think i get both of 
feelings but not the kind of fear that makes you run the kind that makes you sc right gw 
it makes you reflect and i think technology back to technology in search of the sublime is getting at 
same thing that i i know i think for me like the arts humanities fundamental research and science is 
trying to get at in different ways is get at this truth the truth of things and both out 
and also in ourselves like who are we and so human to wanna understand ourselves just a little bit 
than before and that was actually my question for you and i know if an answer for this is 
i really see a difference between out there and in here but both seemed really hard to do and 
was gonna ask you harder or is there like even sc very very quick to say that physics cosmology 
like that are easier than anything involving human beings because precisely the success mode of physics and cosmology is 
we reach for the simplest manifestations of the natural world right it mean easy in any objective sense still 
they seem even harder than they are because we can make so much progress so quickly that led into 
abstruse realms of equations and phenomena that our everyday life does not equip us to deal with but we 
still figure it out and now figured out about physics is amazing even given how much we whereas even 
we figure out human beings still a little bit sketchy right complex systems are the hard systems to understand 
as far as we know we human beings are the most complex systems in the universe to date gw 
love that you are a physicist philosopher humanist all of that in one sc well ge wang thank you 
much for this conversation this was great and i was wondering if maybe we could end by you playing 
out on the ocarina if you have a tune ready gw oh yeah i play a little here sc 
usually have musical accompaniment music pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast ge wang on artful design computers and music three 
daily great episode pingback monday musings knightly builds this brings up a question or few had for a long 
and would be very grateful if you could answer when a string of a musical instrument vibrates it creates 
fundemental frequency as well as i believe only wholeinteger multiples of that frequency called overtones why does that happen 
why are those limited to whole integer multiples is that in any way similar to electron excitment or the 
distribution associated with the double slit experiment why are computers able to produce sound without its associated overtones great 
by the way happy to see the amount of depth you manage to put into mindescape what is design
