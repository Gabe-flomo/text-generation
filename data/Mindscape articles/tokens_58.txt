we have adam rutherford all the way from the united kingdom adam is a geneticist by training but become 
an extremely successful science communicator it seems to me sometimes like every professor of science in england or the 
of the united kingdom also has a column in the guardian a radio show on the bbc etcetera at 
adam does all of those things and also the author of a number of very interesting books he has 
brand new book out which i tease him a little bit on the program i love the title of 
book which is called humanimal the idea behind the book is to relate human beings and how we are 
how we behave to other animals right human beings are animals just like everyone else we think special sc 
are ways in which human beings are different from other animals for example other animals have podcasts at least 
host podcasts as far as i know someone in the comments sure is gonna correct me on that misimpression 
it turns out maybe it be surprising that actually very difficult to pinpoint what it is about human beings 
make us special our brains are big but other animals have big brains we use fire but guess what 
are birds that use fire for purposes of their own other animals use tools other animals use versions of 
so we learn a lot about human beings in our relationship to the rest of the world by looking 
studying the behavior of animals sc and of course adam is also a geneticist so we just study behavior 
also where human beings came from and perhaps because a professor perhaps because a science communicator perhaps because written 
on other topics as well such as synthetic biology and the origin of life adam is a great talker 
who has a lot of opinions about lots of different things so compared to other episodes of mindscape this 
is not as focused on the original theme that i had in mind but i think a feature not 
bug i think a good wideranging rambling conversation where we talk about what life really is how genetics works 
genetics is misunderstood in the public the role of the second law of thermodynamics to what it means to 
alive all sorts of interesting things come up in this so this is a more synthetic than focused episode 
mindscape but good we should cleanse the palate every once in a while with something exactly like that sc 
certainly a lot of fun to listen to i think this is gonna be an entertaining as well as 
podcast so go music sc adam rutherford welcome to the mindscape podcast adam rutherford lovely to talk to you 
sc so a geneticist by training the most recent book though has to do with more the intellectualcultural evolution 
the human species but i know that you did write a previous book that was more biological strictly speaking 
that right ar yeah exactly right in fact so the last book which was called a brief history of 
who ever lived was the application of genetics to human prehistory and human history so the whole premise was 
suddenly given ourselves access to this new historical source which is our dna and the book is well the 
half is about some sort of refiguring human evolution through prehistory and how that has revolutionized our understanding of 
trajectory to here from there and the second half of that book is about using dna as a sort 
historical source to sit alongside the more traditional ways of knowing the past which is archeology and paleontology and 
paper trail and just the things of history ar so very much a book about genetics genetics as a 
source a historical source which is different to those other ones because one that everyone has it is the 
of all humanity the slightly bombastic title chuckle sort of metaphorically true because within every cell of your body 
contain the entire history not just of your family but of our species of our greater family groups within 
evolutionary tree and ultimately all life on earth ar so that was a brief history and there was a 
line in the final chapter of brief history which sorta triggered me thinking about what the next book was 
be and you know this as a writer that sometimes you just get something a seed gets planted and 
shake it and it was it was a line chuckle well you know talked about films before we both 
pop culture and i quote films all the time in my work mostly for my own amusement i sc 
author must keep the self amused otherwise the point of writing a book ar exactly exactly but it has 
to the stage a sort of diseaselike stage for me where quoting things without necessarily realizing when doing it 
i wrote this line which was is special which is another way of saying that no one and i 
it off to my editor and when i got the feedback from the first draft she said like the 
you quoted that film in the last chuckle and i even realized done it do you know what film 
is sc i do but only because i have watched your video ar laughter yeah so from the incredibles 
where you revealed this yeah ar sort of slightly pleased and slightly embarrassed that done this but anyway the 
is that it was that idea of human essentialism of human uniqueness of our incredibly anthropocentric view of the 
where do we position ourselves now with this newfound information about genetics about our cultural evolution about the evolution 
our minds this whole trajectory of science over the last several hundred years has been to inch ourselves back 
nature having spent a long time thinking of ourselves as separate from nature you know this as a cosmologist 
first steps were heliocentrism rather than thinking sc yeah the copernican revolution happens in every subfield of science at 
point ar exactly and for us for the biologists it was just a concept of evolution which of course 
solidified by darwin in and that was the key step that was the copernican version for biology that puts 
in nature part of nature everything done since then has cemented our position in nature and yet a paradox 
do have this sort of conundrum position which is that we accept that we are part of nature an 
we have the same dna the same cell structure blah blah blah and yet the two of us are 
miles away over the internet just managed to get this to work sc and it worked flawlessly the first 
because such advanced creatures yes laughter ar listener it really laughter sc but good so i love the idea 
the most recent book confess i love the title and i know that the title went back and forth 
it ended somewhere unfortunate in my point of view humanimal right ar yeah sc is the title of the 
recent book stated out here ar in the uk called the book of humans and sc that makes sense 
sure so my american publishers the experiment which is a great little publishing house based in new york they 
to try something different and then they suggested this to me very late in the process so very shortly 
publication and my initial response was chuckle not really into neologisms it just jell with me and the first 
was the cover they showed me the cover with this design on it and it did make sense because 
was a sort of blending of the words but the second thing it was a single word argument that 
editor said which was chuckle and i went yeah yeah yeah i see what done so i went with 
gone with it laughter sc i will i mostly want to say good things about your book i will 
one other thing about the american version which is that british you write as a british person does with 
these funny spellings that you folks use chuckle and someone clearly did a global search and replace turning color 
into color color which is too bad because at one point you were contrasting the british and american ways 
spelling things but both the american way in the book ar we spotted that that is corrected now laughter 
okay good not just my hallucination anyway so a wonderful sort of puzzle of a book because on the 
hand yeah obviously we human beings are different in some way and the book does a wonderful job of 
out how hard it is exactly to identify that way because we have so many similarities with animals but 
we get there i do wanna give some chance to talk about the previous book or at least the 
therein in the sense that lay the ground work for understanding who we are in the animal kingdom by 
about our genes our dna what learned how diverged from other primates and so forth so what is the 
big picture story of humanity over evolutionary time ar right so a great question well a great question at 
point in time a particularly great question right now because the whole field has gone through a massive a 
revolution which is ongoing so a revolution that we really anticipate was gonna happen and all predicated on two 
the first is that we simply understand genetics better now than at any point in history and just the 
of science the way the code translates into a lived life our fundamental biology we know that better than 
any other time and all posthuman genome project which was sort of nominally complete in so step one but 
second thing is that we invented the technology the ability to extract dna not just from you and me 
living people but from people who have been dead for thousands hundreds of thousands tens of thousands of years 
that gave us access to this historical source in people who in the past we had scarce remains of 
most of our understanding of evolution was based on paleontology so old bones ar and they are still valid 
are very very useful pieces of evidence in understanding the story of how we got from there to here 
limited and the genome is the richest source of data is the richest data set that aware of in 
universe and so having access to that unlocking that meant that all of a sudden we just suddenly had 
amazingly rich data set it started with neanderthals in soon after that we had discovered in a cave in 
just a little finger bone of a teenage girl and a single molar tooth which is not enough to 
this is a different type of human enough to say a hominin sc are these the denosovians denisovans ar 
exactly yeah denisovans sc denisovans by the way when you say neanderthals what do you mean is we got 
dna is that right ar yeah yeah so first discovered in the first named in the always identified as 
separate species from us they do look a bit different to us big barrel chests much more muscular slightly 
brows heavier eyebrows bigger nasal capacity so they were legitimately classes of different species to us during the era 
morphology being the primary determinate which still in back in svante group managed to get the full genome out 
a neanderthal specimen and in doing so we suddenly went well okay not only do we have the whole 
but we can tell immediately a big outstanding question from human evolution which is what is the relationship between 
sapiens and homo neanderthalensis ar we can calculate using dna when our species diverged in time which we now 
is around years ago which roughly fits with what the bones told us as well and what the trajectory 
africa or into europe neanderthals are primarily european or eurasian species whereas homo sapiens started in africa and but 
and this is the really exciting thing the evidence is unequivocal that there was what geneticists euphemistically referred to 
gene flow events sc such a sexy term ar i know chuckle yeah not really a great chatup line 
is it but you know genetics is fundamentally about sex and families but we introduce all of these terms 
make it sound so boring unbelievable but yeah so when we got the neanderthal genome in we then have 
evidence that there were gene flow events between homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis and we we could identify bits 
the genome in living people which we now know are derived from neanderthals and so i know you and 
can tell from looking at you that you have european ancestry as do i basically all people of recent 
ancestry have approximately to neanderthal dna which we can only tell by having the full neanderthal genome ar now 
throws the whole field of sort of species definitions of taxonomy into disarray and this appeals to me because 
of opposed to taxonomy in many ways phrase which i think is very elegant and very accurate is that 
suffer as a species from the tyranny of the discontinuous mind we obsessively try to put things in neat 
listen with apologies to you and i say this in public but never to actually a physicist that talking 
laughter biology i get physics envy because in general i think of physics as being quite reductionist and that 
boxes are quite neat biology is just a science of exceptions incredibly messy every time we come up with 
rule the first thing you do is look for exceptions to it and there always are sc yeah ar 
homo neanderthalensis a different species from homo sapiens well yes because we decided it was the species definition says 
two separate species are organisms that cannot reproduce and make fertile offspring sc what i was taught ar right 
looking at you sc but they did that yeah here we are ar looking at the fertile offspring of 
neanderthal and homo sapiens mating admittedly to years ago and that says well either the species definition is wrong 
neanderthalensis and homo sapiens are not separate species or what i think not sure it matters sc yeah ar 
i think that it inform the experiment that you have to ask which is fundamental to the scientific process 
we wedded to a definition to such an extent that it stops you asking what these creatures did rather 
what they are and i think that a lot of science is slightly paralyzed by that obsession with holding 
to what a thing is i suppose in planetary physics that the equivalent is the pluto story sc pluto 
yeah exactly and my mind was changed by reading mike book about it mike was a previous podcast guest 
my attitude was you know been a planet in the text books just keep who gets hurt by calling 
a and his response was helps organize our understanding of the world gonna go out there and look at 
stars and the planets around them and it will be useful to future generations to have a definition for 
planet and and in his mind there are no definitions of planets which would include pluto without also including 
of other things so i think that made sense to me the question is what is the usefulness to 
as scientists ar i think that is exactly right but it is how it informs the question that asking 
example which i wrote about in an earlier book when i was writing about the origin of life and 
historical obsession trying to define what life is i argue has actually fundamentally hampered the experiments to determine what 
origin what occurred during a biogenesis when chemistry became biochemistry and the reason for that is because for a 
time since the beginning of the century people have been thinking about what life is rather than what life 
and as soon as you start looking for the fundamental bases of what life does rather than trying to 
it down and say this is the sort of platonic ideal of a living thing or a planet if 
or a species if talking about homo sapiens or homo neanderthalensis as soon as you sort of release yourself 
the shackles you can just ask a much more interesting question which is what is the common behavior of 
cell of every single cell which says this is what a living system is rather than this is what 
living system does i do go on sc this is deep philosophical waters that we could potentially wade into 
not sure how i feel about this attitude to be honest because i look at people who have argued 
the definition of life and i agree with any of them and one of the reasons i agree with 
of them is because they almost always include the fact of natural selection and biological evolution and my attitude 
a physicist is like if i took a bunch of atoms and one by one made a cat out 
them a sterile cat that it could not possibly reproduce made that and walking around and meowing and never 
reproduce there is no biological evolution and natural selection involved but you possibly tell me the not alive sc 
so i think that there is a even though frustrating and occasionally unhelpful nevertheless value in having these debates 
how we should draw the lines knowing that they could always be adjusted and we could always learn new 
and we could always do it better ar i think right but not just playing to the audience here 
playing to the interviewer here i think there is a better understanding of what life does rather than what 
is and it is a basic physics principle and i think that biologists have really misunderstood or paid attention 
basic physics and it is the second law of thermodynamics because what life does is that it temporarily no 
contravene i have to get my language exactly right here i just gonna sc yeah gonna hit my other 
buttons here laughter ar no it contravene your sc you ar especially thermodynamics are nonnegotiable they are nonnegotiable sc 
have laws right ar but the analogy i used in that book and used in lectures and tv programs 
life is the only thing that has sat at the table in the casino continuously for the last four 
years we reduce negative entropy that is what living systems do and until our cells are ordered states until 
die and then they submit to the will of the universe that work with you sc you know all 
but the process of keeping our bodies in homeostatic order i also have antonio damasio coming up on the 
overall increases the entropy of the universe the way that i like to put it is that not that 
either contravenes or even temporarily resists the second law of thermodynamics life is an expression of the second law 
thermodynamics it relies on the second law of thermodynamics if we were in thermal equilibrium there be any life 
is one of the ways in which entropy increases ar right well i deny that and i would be 
to deny that in conversation with a physicist but what that sort of slightly philosophy of science context says 
a metabolic way and this is where i think important for informing your experiments as a biological researcher at 
lab at the bench is that it says that life is a process of extracting energy from its environment 
utilizing that energy and that is a manifestation i mean this is all from schrödinger right this all sc 
and i completely agree with what you just said i think it is important i think the biologists always 
it very seriously ar you see a darwinian to my core i think it is probably the most powerful 
that ever come up with it is difficult to conceive of life in the rest of the universe that 
in a darwinian process not just say that that is not the case but just i my imagination is 
rich enough to imagine a nondarwinian process but further than that i think what underlies darwinian processes is especially 
considering the origin of life is a metabolic process is extracting useful energy from the environment and talking about 
because we were thinking about taxonomy and categorization i think inherently important in this regard because gotta think about 
an organism is doing at the origin of life which then puts you in a particular position on earth 
so you say well one of the classic questions is is a flame a living organism because it behaves 
a very similar way in terms of extracting energy from the environment as a source it needs it can 
continuous if you feed it is that a living thing is a crystal a living thing and this is 
idea that schrödinger investigated because capable of reproduction no i think so it looks a bit like it has 
of natural selection the information that is being transferred from generation to generation that modified though and so piling 
things on top of each other if we need a sort of framework in order to understand what life 
rather than what life is i think you have to start with the basics which is energy extraction from 
environment natural selection comes after that ar why this is important is because biology is so ridiculously complicated that 
try and break down the processes of genetics and cellular mechanics and metabolic pathways and stuff like that and 
hard to break the circle because got dna which encodes rna which makes proteins and proteins do stuff and 
proteins many proteins are involved in making dna in order to continue this cycle so how do you break 
deadlock sc how could it possibly have started also right ar exactly now got a reasonable model of how 
information process started well actually it probably it looks like it started with rna rather than dna which is 
simpler but less robust molecule and can store information the concept of the original gene which is simply a 
thing a unit of replication but no one ever thought to say that process occur unless you have metabolic 
ar the whole concept of the primordial soup or the primeval soup which was first formulated in the first 
of decades of the century by two by haldane and by oparin in russia a very sticky name for 
which i think is part of its successes as an idea in the in there is the classic ureymiller 
where miller was a phd student who asked to do this experiment where he sealed a bunch of simple 
water carbon dioxide methane in a sealed tube put volts across it and just let it stew and his 
urey said give you two after four days the whole clear liquid goes brown they extract it and full 
amino acids amino acids being the building blocks of life and everyone goes created ar a really important and 
experiment that but it do what life does the thermodynamics of that chemistry is over once that is reacted 
is no incentive for that reaction to continue and what life is is a continuous chemical reaction a chemical 
which is sustained and has been sustained for four billion years without break so the concepts of the primordial 
and the ureymiller experiment interesting they tell you where life came from because they replicate what life does ar 
concepts like people say we need a bolt of lightning so we need some energy source well not powered 
lightning some people darwin talked about the warm little pond and if you got the chemistry right on the 
of the earth heated by the sun or whatever then that is a possible way to think about how 
chemicals become more complex chemicals or in modern parlance how chemistry becomes biochemistry except not powered by the sun 
one thought to say what does life actually there are no well there are ponds powered by the sun 
a later development in evolution powered by metabolism powered by proton gradients by extracting energy by putting energy on 
putting high energy things on one side of a barrier and low energy on the other side and letting 
run from one to the other and how all life is powered sc so the audience should know in 
they figured it out already that also written a book about the origin of life laughter ar yeah we 
this conversation at all but this sc not very good at planning but okay we adapt to our environment 
conversation ar i think interaction of physics and biology is perfect sc it is in fact we could go 
about nothing but this but i some interesting stuff about humanity that i wanna get to ar yeah sc 
yeah the end point of these billions of years of biological evolution but at some point regardless of opinions 
the usefulness of categorizations and taxonomy something that we call homo sapiens so for the nonbiologist out there just 
us the rough guide to when did human when did we first have homo sapiens and what made us 
from the other great apes that related to like what is the distinction there ar okay so having dissed 
gonna adhere to it now for the useful purposes of this conversation sc there you go ar so anything 
the genus homo we refer to as human so this is a genus that emerged a couple of million 
ago the oldest is homo habilis which literally means handyman so we wanna why we call it that and 
have been a few maybe somewhere between five and ten depending on how you define them versions of humans 
the last couple of million years we are the last remaining member of that family the last remaining humans 
go back years and got homo neanderthalensis which is the neanderthals got the denisovans which have a designation as 
separate species but almost certainly were as much as homo neanderthalensis was ar and then earlier versions such as 
erectus homo antecessor homo heidelbergensis and they all have different characteristics some derived some new they all reflect adaptations 
local environments which is how evolution works and then oddities like homo floresiensis so the funny little hobbit creatures 
small meterhigh humans that have only been found on flores so far but just last week another possibly new 
of dwarf humans was found nearby another island near there and so all of those are categorized as humans 
we put them into the genus homo ar now homo sapiens itself the earliest versions of homo sapiens until 
two years ago came from the rift valley and were about years old so particularly from ethiopia and we 
thought of east africa being the nursery of humankind in that sense late it was some fossils that had 
found in the century in morocco in a place called jebel irhoud were redated and they came out as 
minimum of years old and they are also homo sapiens so now beginning to think of homo sapiens as 
a sort of a panafrican species so a species possibly made up of multiple locations of slightly different versions 
homo sapiens from around africa ar now so we are fundamentally an african species and then something significant happens 
years ago probably around years ago which is a small band of them migrate out of africa and that 
the population from which the rest of homo sapiens is derived the language as with the taxonomy is deeply 
here because we talk about migrations and we generally we think about migrations in modern terms people going from 
to there or deciding that gonna move from this place to another place in evolutionary times talking about migrations 
have taken thousands of years so we talk the out of africa event is an event that takes thousands 
years migrating at the rate of a mile per ar a slow diffusion more than picking up states and 
thousands of miles away ar yeah exactly so one of my lectures is about time scales in science in 
and how people like you think about time scales as billions of years as a heart beat people like 
think of years as being a flash in the pan much happier with hundreds of thousands or millions and 
got the quantum physicists who are talking about time scales which are unimaginable unimaginably small so that scale of 
i find that one of the biggest problems in the sort of popular discourse of human evolution is recognizing 
rate of change which is immensely slow in terms of human appreciation ar so there was the out of 
event taking tens of thousands of years homo sapiens then spreads around the world so we move out of 
some go east towards europe sorry west towards europe those are the ones that have the gene flow events 
the neanderthals some go further east and they have gene flow events with the denisovans and generally we spread 
over the world and by years ago we are everywhere apart from the overlapping conversation ar yeah that really 
until about years ago when during the last ice age so much of the waters of the oceans are 
up into glaciers and so sea level is much lower what is now the bering straits was just land 
land between siberia and what is now alaska and there is a movement of people across from what is 
siberia into what is now alaska and then the seas rise years ago and that population is cut off 
they are the founding indigenous people of the americas we now know with great certainty because of genetics that 
the preeuropean colonization populations of north and south america are derived from that original founding population around about years 
yeah so the basic story how we got there sc and one of the things i just it sort 
chronologically belong here but i wanna forget it one of the things i learned from your book is this 
from twentyfour pairs of chromosomes to twentythree pairs of chromosomes and how that separates humanity genus homo from the 
great apes and could you just explain to the audience what that is and maybe speculate a little bit 
what that meant for why special ar yeah yeah a really good point and a point that comes up 
quite useful in having arguments with creationists to the extent that the pope john paul ii used this as 
of his argument as to why evolution was correct and a sort of basic facet of biology our genes 
organized into chromosomes which are long stretches of dna which arranged during a certain point in the cell cycle 
those iconic structures which look a little bit like i know xs i talk about them as being like 
socks so if you take a pair of socks and pinch the middle kind of a lot what chromosomes 
like and they are discrete packages of dna which vary in size the ones we are most familiar with 
the x and the y so me and you have one x and one y the y is the 
and that sort of shriveled piece of stunted chromosome whereas the x is a sort of magnificent beast of 
chromosome women have two xs and we have an x and a y in general ar we have homo 
have twentythree pairs of chromosomes you get one set from your father via the sperm and one set via 
mother from her egg so we have fortysix in total twentythree pairs so you got two pairs of two 
of chromosome two pairs of chromosome blah blah blah blah all the way up to and then you either 
an x and an x or an x and a y if you are genetically typical ar all of 
other great apes of which there are four so gorillas bonobos chimpanzees was that four yes and subspecies of 
of them all of those have twentyfour pairs of chromosome so fortyeight in total and a few years ago 
worked out how that changed so our common ancestor with chimpanzees and all the other great apes had twentyfour 
but at some point probably seven or eight million years ago there was an enormous chromosomal disruption during probably 
individual and normally chromosomal disruptions like this are fatal but this one and two bits two chromosomes in our 
fused together and made chromosome two for us so our chromosome two is the fusion of two ape chromosomes 
have stuck together at some point and instead of killing that individual which is typical in situations like that 
gave birth to the the rest of humankind sc crazy to even imagine that it kill that offspring it 
such a large disruption of how your dna was organized ar yeah there are very few chromosomal abnormalities of 
sort of scale which are nonlethal syndrome is one example so having three chromosome mostly those are what they 
translocations mostly those translocations either result in profound serious diseases like cancers or just lethal early on during development 
after conception but for reasons that we understand this was a massive chromosomal translocation and fusion which resulted not 
lethality but in the birth of our genus ar the reason this is important biologically is because basic high 
level biology which teaches us about how sperm and eggs are made and how the process of the shuffling 
our genes as we have sexual reproduction occurs and it requires the two individuals to have the same number 
chromosomes because the chromosomes line up and they swap it over with each other if got a different number 
chromosomes then got a massive disjuncture you swap evenly and a lot of the reason why we think that 
different numbers of chromosomes or why we be able to reproduce with chimpanzees ar having said that and this 
a reference to what i was saying earlier about biology being a science of exceptions a paper published a 
of years ago described successful hybrids between species of equids so horses horse to horse type species who had 
ranges of between sixty and and i remember this paper landing on my desk because it was i looked 
it and it was one of those moments where the first reaction is and the second reaction is so 
this is one of our basic rules sc you say anything with definitiveness in this whole field ar no 
you you and we know how that works so there a current model of how that could possibly be 
case sc i mean it seems that that first offspring to have twentythree chromosomes had to mate with somebody 
somebody with twentyfour and the twentythree won out at least in some subset of the offspring ar yeah so 
this is another aspect of the sort of language that we use because we have sort of such a 
association with things like sex and reproduction and to a certain extent the basic mechanisms of biology i think 
we make generalizations which make a lot of sense but actually necessarily reflect the time scales involved so yes 
mutation had to happen once but more that we have to think about it conceptually as an event rather 
a sort of singular event at the same i mean i struggle with this i struggle with this on 
grounds that it did have to have i mean it happened once but at the same time can we 
a trajectory back to that individual well probably not but what we then begin to look at is the 
within that mutation occurred and how that was transferred within a population and it becomes a sort of ancestral 
ar another example of this which is one that many of the listeners will be familiar with which is 
birth of eukaryotic life so life is divided into in our taxonomy three domains which are bacteria archaea which 
very similar to bacteria but different enough to be sort of a different category different domain and then everything 
and everything else is eukaryotes and eukaryotes includes us and blue whales and fungus and all plants the fundamental 
between the bacteria and the archaea and the eukaryotes is that we have this subcellular unit called the mitochondria 
the energygenerating where all the electron transfer chain that we were talking about earlier in terms of energy generation 
now what we now know and sort of a deeply heretical thinker called lynn margulis came up with this 
a theory in the and it is unequivocally correct now sc we now know right yeah ar exactly was 
it this was an event where one cell got inside another cell which happens a lot but normally the 
that gets inside the other cell gets consumed as food but somehow this resulted in the stable transfer of 
cell becoming inside another cell and that resulted in the single birthplace of the origin of all life that 
that archaea again the evidence says this is an extraordinarily unlikely event and it may have happened many times 
it only appears to have survived once and again it becomes a sort of singular node on the evolutionary 
of life and a node from which two billion years later me and you having a conversation i find 
conceptually hard problematic chuckle sc well yeah it did take a long time and exactly because rare and sure 
the thing was also rare it seems likely to me that it only happened that once once it happens 
gonna be evolutionarily adaptive if gonna be good then gonna spread and that seems to be what happened rather 
it happening separately all over the place so it seem that crazy to me ar yeah but evolution is 
creative over long time periods but also incredibly conservative and so we notice just from the way that the 
code is constructed so without getting too technical about this we have four letters of genetic code but in 
arranged in triplets and the triplets encode individual amino acids of which we have and all proteins are made 
those twenty amino acids in different orders the three letters of the genetic code are not evenly not equally 
and a good evolutionary reason for that so the first one sort of determines what type of amino acid 
is gonna be is it gonna be hydrophilic or hydrophobic the second one is more specific than that and 
third one has some redundancy in there so you have in the genetic code in the way that we 
those four letters into triplets there are sixtyfour versions but only twenty amino acids so redundancy in the code 
allows this third letter of a triplet codon to change without fundamentally screwing up the amino acid if you 
the first one right if you take a standard protein and change one amino acid from being hydrophilic to 
the chances are broken your protein sc yeah ar but if you take the same amino acid and change 
third codon from an a to a t or whatever then you may be just the difference you may 
just encoding the difference between blue eyes and brown eyes or the subtle differences between me and you and 
evolution the genetic code is conservative in that sense it has this it has this builtin mechanism which is 
it allow it allows experimentation but it allow experimentation which is sort of radical but what talking about are 
great transitions in evolution and they do appear to be radical things things that are sort of insanely radical 
huge chromosomal shifts or like one organism swallowing another and not eating it but instead taking some of its 
sc creating a life together yeah and making it matter ar yeah sc yeah no no i get that 
i think this actually remarkably enough reminds me of the conversation i had with edward watts who was a 
of ancient rome and history is the same way as you described evolution long periods where more or less 
much happening and then suddenly something dramatic changes i was asking about the wellknown great man theory of history 
we give so much credit to these individuals when obviously many more people we know about also played a 
and his answer which i thought was very insightful was most of the time the great individuals matter the 
thing would have happened but at these crucial periods where things are on a precipice when near a transition 
there could be a huge impact to a very small number of people acting in the right way and 
think that the same story could probably be told genetically rather than historically ar i think right and spent 
lot of time thinking about this and wrangling with my desire to tell the true story of how science 
and how what we commonly refer to as a scientech revolution in the last four or five centuries and 
course that view the whiggish view of history that you can draw a line a straight line as historically 
science between i know aristotle all the way to through darwin through faraday through einstein and to hawking and 
things are easy to do do they represent how science and how knowledge is actually transferred well probably not 
the same time and i think about these as nodes as well darwin is my man right and that 
a nodal event stuff was different on the of november one thousand eight hundred fiftynine than it was the 
before there was a radical shift well a post hoc radical shift between the publication before prepublication of the 
of species and afterwards was the idea in the air well definitely he conceive of evolution i mean people 
talking about evolution ar his grandfather erasmus darwin was a key proponent of thinking about evolution lamarck who in 
uk at least we kind of mock for getting his theory of evolution wrong acquired characteristics the whole idea 
giraffes have long necks because during their lives they stretch to reach the tallest branches and that characteristic is 
on to the next generation well you know he was a good scientist he had a theory and it 
a theory that was based on observations and it was wrong and really unfair to mock him for that 
france they mock him they have a lamarck day and i think right sc i actually while reading your 
was wondering if we could imagine the alien species which did evolve through lamarckian means like going to work 
would make their children stronger as well as themselves ar yeah well i think that is perfectly plausible i 
it would take much imagination to come up with that and actually a darwinianlamarckian process and we forget i 
about it in the last book but darwin answer all the questions of evolution in he got the ground 
revolutionarily right and spent the next one hundred sixty years trying to disprove him and basically failing at every 
he was pretty lamarckian about many aspects he know genetics he know about genes he know what the unit 
selection was that come until the and what we refer to as neodarwinism and he thought that there was 
for acquired characteristics being passed on at least in plants from generation to generation and again a sign of 
good scientist to come up with ideas which subsequently turn out to be incorrect sc prodarwin here on the 
podcast as a matter of official doctrine chuckle and so even prolamarck he was a good scientist scientists should 
allowed to be wrong but all this talk of turning points and phase transitions brings up something i wanted 
ask about because we have clearly a turning point when homo sapiens comes on the scene roughly years ago 
that a fair number ar yeah sc but then there is this even more mysterious turning point or years 
ar yeah sc where we change that much biologically you make the point in the book that if you 
a year old homo sapiens up and gave them a shave and put them in nice clothes you maybe 
tell on the streets certainly not the streets of los angeles that they were in any way unusual but 
is this more cultural intellectual cognitive shift not sure how to put it just years ago ar yeah no 
right and this is the paradox this is the subtitle of the book is how homo sapiens became most 
creature and i think a useful way to think about it because we do have this weird stasis between 
ago and say years ago where we change physically we really change genetically very significantly none of those big 
shifts that we just talked about in terms of going from twentythree to twentyfour chromosomes or whatever none of 
happens there is definite genetic change but not so much that all quite clearly the same species and clearly 
of interbreeding but then there is this sudden emergence and evolutionary timescales talking about so sudden meaning tens of 
of years of what we might refer to as behavioral modernity so the things the characteristics that we recognize 
ourselves and so they are things like high levels of skill in terms of tool making in terms of 
dexterity and manifested in the archeological remains in the way that tools became much more sophisticated in the way 
we are clearly in control of manipulating fire which is a very important step in our evolution something that 
thought was sort of quintessential to humans ar but also we see the emergence of things like abstract thought 
that manifests as art so we have the cave paintings we have the earliest examples of figurative art so 
like the löwenmensch the lionman of hohlensteinstadel which is this just beautiful statue carved out of a tusk of 
man with seven stripes down his left arm which we think might be tattoos we think that they had 
kits at that time but it has the head of a cave lion now beautiful a work of art 
in whatever manifestation thinking about it but it also shows aspects of behavioral modernity it shows that the mind 
it was not substantively different from our minds today it shows creativity it shows the ability to imagine a 
a beast that does not exist it exist in isolation so it must be part of a series so 
shows immense manual dexterity the selection of the tools required the selection of the material required it shows some 
of totemic importance of lions at that stage ar we can only guess as to what those things meant 
the important thing is it shows that the person behind the creation of that thing was fundamentally no different 
terms of their cognitive abilities to us and we see that earlier we see the we see flashes of 
flashes of things that you might call art or abstract displays of thought but from about years ago we 
it continuously and we see it all over the world and so people have referred to this as the 
revolution not keen on that phrase i think revolution should take i think they should take twentyfour hours or 
week or something rather than years chuckle but we see the lionman and then we see these venus figurines 
over europe which they tend to be smaller little amulets of the female form often with very exaggerated sexual 
so people have speculated that they are to do with sexuality or reproduction i sort of care because we 
the mind of someone else the joke i make in lectures is hard enough to know the mind of 
actually married to let alone someone who died laughter years ago so they might have been toys they might 
been dolls maybe they were totemic reproductive symbols we know sc to me i think we actually underappreciate maybe 
appearance of these artistic figures in the following sense not only the carved figures but the cave paintings we 
so used to doing this this is very human making art but there had to be a first time 
it happened and kind of amazing we think of even our closest relatives in the great apes as making 
of themselves i think ever happened so is there any idea of what caused it do you know there 
to be as we said any physiological change going on ar no and exactly right we see any manifestations 
this creative process in any other organism apart from homo sapiens with one caveat which we can talk about 
just a minute and that is weird so why would that be and the truthful answer is well we 
sc right ar so the speculation on why the cognitive not gonna call it that the transition to behavioral 
is important as a concept is because it represents a big shift in our evolutionary trajectory which appear to 
modulated by genetics by physiological or genetic change but in fact is an evolution which is predicated on social 
and so one analogy which i quite like is that if we think about our biology as being hardware 
our culture as being software then what we have gone through in that transitionary period is shifted so much 
the emphasis of our biological makeup from hardware to software so the hardware fundamentally change but it is in 
interaction of software in the cultural domain how we interact with other organisms in the same species as us 
has fundamentally changed and formulated the basis for all of the creation of these things we can speculate reasonably 
i know being able to carve a flute or make the best possible tools or paint a megalosaurus on 
cave wall we can speculate that that is an attractive characteristic because that is something that other members of 
tribe will look at and say the guy who does the megalosaurus cave paintings and therefore a successful person 
therefore from a reproductive sense we might wanna reproduce with him ar and so a characteristic which is gonna 
passed on through the generations the fact that not necessarily genetically encoded i think is really important and this 
really the key idea in the book the emergence of social behaviors the transfer from hardware to software talked 
that for a few years now stuff that jared diamond has written extensively about and darwin talks about it 
one thousand eight hundred seventyone in the descent of man why it happened and the mechanism by which it 
in terms of how our populations were structured well brand new and an idea which emerges out well two 
centers so basically ucl which is where affiliated and also harvard so a guy called joseph heinrich at harvard 
kind of remarkably unsexy in its genesis ar it seems to be determined by population size so when we 
these things mathematically and this corresponds with what the archeological record looks like it appears to be the case 
as population sizes increase you see a simultaneous expansion in these sort of creative artifacts what it looks like 
we see this sudden expansion in the complexity of the archeological record and what the mathematical model suggests is 
this coincides with our population is suddenly increasing in size and so this is kind of the key idea 
transition is how we talk about it and all to do with information transfer sc right ar so we 
very uneven distribution of expertise in humans unlike all other species you know physics i know biology if you 
to get your car fixed you take it to the shop if you wanna know how to do a 
that you know how to do what do you do you ask someone who knows how to do it 
mathematical model suggests that if a population size is above a certain threshold then the transmission of that information 
with great efficiency and when your population is below a certain size threshold then it occurs with great inefficiency 
sc is it population size or density ar probably a combination of both of those things so the way 
described it it sounds very academic and very mathematical but it actually kind of makes a lot of sense 
an age before writing stuff down where you can record things and therefore pass on that information on wikipedia 
in a book the ability if the guy in the village who makes the flutes if you wanna know 
to make a flute you come to me right but if only ten people then all gonna learn how 
make the flute from me and all got to learn it really accurately in order to pass that unit 
information flutemaking into the next generation if the population is very large it means that inefficient transfer of flutemaking 
can pass to many many people and that can be passed on and that can be a continuous unit 
can transfer both horizontally and vertically through the generations and that coincides that population expansion that transfer of information 
whatever the unit of information that appears to coincide with the sudden emergence of things like figurative art of 
complexity and tools and it happens all over the world ar only talked about europe and the sort of 
paintings we have a very eurocentric view of evolution changed in the last couple of years the earliest figurative 
was the lionman now a banteng painting in borneo and that was only published last year and about the 
date but the overlap the error bars point to borneo being older we see it in african populations we 
it in the middle east and as populations grow we see a sudden expansions in the indicators of behavioral 
ar we also see the opposite in one particular example which has some cultural sensitivity and that is tasmania 
until the last glacial maximum or years ago tasmania is attached to mainland australia and there were people indigenous 
are throughout those joint islands the seas rise as the glaciers melt tasmania become separated becomes an island got 
evidence that they were seagoing indigenous people of tasmania was seagoing and that transfer between tasmania and mainland australia 
an isolated population for the last years ar now what we see in the archeological record is very interesting 
at a time years ago we see a sort of standard level of complexities of tools a tool set 
is in the few dozen by the time european colonizers arrive in the century on mainland australia the tool 
for indigenous people of the australias has gone up at a standard rate and is now in the hundreds 
the tool set of the indigenous people of tasmania has dropped to below we see specific examples of this 
is the loss of things like finetooth bone harpoons and it looks like the people of tasmania had returned 
being foragers on the sea front rather than hunting for fish beyond the barrier using harpoons and got records 
that from history such as james men as they were arriving in places like tasmania said that the indigenous 
expressed shock that they were hunting for cartilaginous fish we see the disappearance of cartilaginous fish bones in the 
record ar talking about this it does have cultural sensitivities not saying that not making any judgement about the 
the indigenous people of tasmania during that evolutionary trajectory just the fact that they did not continue to develop 
in the same way that mainland in australia indigenous people did which was based on constant interaction with other 
travel sharing of information rather than a very isolated population sc very consistent with the point that geoffrey west 
on an earlier podcast that innovation happens not linearly with population but with some higher power you innovate more 
more quickly as the density of interactions gets more and more vivid and vibrant and i think that it 
speaks to this question of whether or not scientific technological intellectual progress is a story of a few geniuses 
something more collective because certainly if you just listed the great breakthroughs there would be a few geniuses who 
the credit but only in retrospect only because they were embedded in these larger communities of thought and that 
human beings lived before the industrial revolution and yet most good ideas in some sense happened afterward and i 
that this is not that we human beings have gotten better but the environments that in have changed dramatically 
i think exactly right and so we do legitimately say that darwin was a genius and newton was a 
and rosalind franklin was a genius and those people in which changes pivoted those nodal events in the history 
science or the history of thought the environment in which in is the stew from which they are allowed 
emerge though i think a difference between the myth of the genius and the myth of the sort of 
lone genius those two things are slightly different i do think for example that darwin had both well grit 
by being extremely wealthy and therefore not having to work sc it helps ar it certainly does but he 
out that theory over twenty or thirty years after being on the beagle so he go to the galapagos 
see the finches and go shit chuckle he went back home and spent years working on pigeon bones and 
to literally hundreds of people to ask for bits of information where he was carving out his one big 
it was that intellectual environment that enabled him to see further to have that which pushes him from being 
of the great scientists into what i argue is the greatest scientist and we forget that alfred wallace came 
with exactly the same idea in far less detail at exactly the same time wrote to darwin and said 
idea out in indonesia at the and darwin yep got it sc my idea yeah chuckle ar and in 
announced it together so a year so darwin was ill and wallace was absent but it was presented at 
linnean society together which i think befits the quality of the idea and it also reflects the nature that 
is an idea that is in the air right sc right exactly and i think part of the lesson 
how these developments happen but i want gonna have to come to a close pretty soon so i want 
go too far in the spirit of your book just been talking about things that make human beings special 
of the point of your book is to say that many of the things that we think make us 
are in fact found there in other species of animals so we talked about tool use and art and 
forth but tool use in particular you just have a wonderful selection of examples of tools being used by 
animals that takes us down just a little bit of a path ar yeah yeah sure yeah so one 
the themes of all of my work and i think particularly exemplified in this last book in humanimal is 
not really into uniqueness theories not really into triggers talked about nodes these events where things flow into them 
then the world blossoms out of it or new knowledge blossoms out of it i like to revel in 
complexity and the sophistication that is actually how science works and actually how evolution works and one of the 
that we are really prone to do is to suggest that there are individual things this is the thing 
made us human and people for hundreds thousands of years and continue to this day to have successful careers 
was darwin said was fire tools and other people have serious people have said that it the pyrophilic ape 
that it is fire that is the determining factor in switching us from being the earlier versions of ourselves 
the versions that we recognize today other people have suggested hallucinogenic drugs ar it is all of those things 
none of the above and i think important is to recognize that having the biological framework to manipulate fire 
speak as doing or the physical capability and the neural capability to carve a stone something that dolphins will 
be able to do because they need their four limbs to paddle so fused together they hold things they 
never carve a hand axe they will never carve a flute dolphins will never be able to manipulate fire 
because they live in the sea chuckle and that means that their evolutionary trajectory is fundamentally different to ours 
yeah ar i think very good at recognizing the sort of cosmic happenstance the environment in which evolution happens 
i think very attracted to looking at behaviors that look familiar to us because we do them and then 
see an animal doing it and then just automatically saying the chimpanzee does this we are closely related to 
therefore this is an evolutionary behavior which we have inherited from our common ancestors the we just know that 
yeah ar often very hard things to test tool use used to be thought of as uniquely human we 
know because we watch nature documentaries that loads well all the great apes and loads of other primates use 
sticks wooden and stone tools we now know that the corvids and other birds are sophisticated tool users in 
tool use we are obligate tool users which means we function without tools and we now think that around 
of animals are obligate tool users which sound like a lot one in but that is literally thousands of 
more interesting than the number is the range so lots of mammals do it we do it other primates 
it sc in fact dolphins do it you mentioned dolphins ar yeah ne example of dolphins using tools which 
think is of fundamental interest because the mechanism by which the transfer of that tool skill looks more like 
way that we do it which is that we talk to each other and and what doing now sharing 
the example in dolphins is wonderful a pod of bottlenose dolphins in australia in shark bay in australia have 
studied for decades were observed doing something peculiar a proportion of them about of them were observed doing something 
which is that they would swim down to the sea floor and sort of work a sponge onto their 
which is their beak well initially the researchers know why they did this chuckle but then when they went 
with them it was observed that they were using these sponges as protection for when they were foraging on 
sea floor because rocky and you wanna scratch up your beak because that can get infected and bad ar 
this is an example of one animal using another animal to hunt for a third animal relatively rare we 
do that sometimes but that is unusual in itself the story gets much more interesting in the when it 
worked out why only a proportion of the dolphins were doing this which is only females do it so 
males have ever been observed sponging like this and that is difficult to explain you see any differential sexual 
between the males and the females who are sponging and who but hard to understand why something which clearly 
benefit is only being done by females there are lots of obvious jokes to make at this point laughter 
it may be the males are idiots chuckle rude to male dolphins laughter ar but a on top of 
when the genetics of the dolphins that are doing the sponging behavior was looked at not particularly closely related 
all the females that are doing this not mother and daughter not sisters so this looks like a behavior 
is spread laterally that is being either learnt or taught and there is a sort of academic distinction between 
two which a bit fuzzy on and not that keen on what the distinction is but one of the 
i frame the book is that we lots of animals learn but only humans teach which is not nuance 
that it looks like this behavior within the sponging definitely a learnt behavior it may be a taught behavior 
have to remember that most organisms spend almost all of their time unobserved by us ar and a third 
that emerges from this which i just think is wonderful you can look at the pattern of behavior of 
sponging behavior in the dolphins that do this and we can check their relatedness via dna which also means 
can sort of trace back through time an evolutionary pedigree of where that behavior actually started and it starts 
a single origin talking about single origins again it looks like it was six generations ago generational time in 
dolphin in a bottlenose dolphin is around about twentyfive years so that puts it to an individual female in 
century who we refer to as sponging eve who i know one morning got up put a sponge on 
nose it seemed like a good thing to do sc a lone dolphin genius ar i know one hundred 
years later well not all of them all of the females are doing it and the males have yet 
catch on a wonderful example it demonstrates so many things about the cognitive abilities of different animals the transfer 
information between individuals within that group but i think more than anything it tells us something terribly important which 
the best thing a scientist can ever say about anything which is really sc right laughter and also a 
thing to contrast not only with human beings but with other toolusing animals i mean you have the wonderful 
in your book of the birds that spread wildfires intentionally darwin and others thought of us human beings as 
animals that use fire but clearly not true ar right it turns out a few animals are dependent on 
and utilize fire in various capacities chimpanzees in fongoli in senegal have a sophisticated understanding of the regular the 
wildfires they will stay near fires which are very dangerous and capricious they will cruise in as soon as 
fires have gone out and foraged for semicooked organisms there are beetles that head towards fire with infrared detectors 
their bodies because they will plant their eggs in recently burnt logs ar so there are plenty of animals 
more plants that understand that fire is part of their natural ecology but the idea that essential for humans 
very powerful for a number of obvious reasons one it allows us to keep warm as we migrate away 
the equator so that facilitates us moving around the world two it has social importance to this day that 
two meters from our sc there you go ar on which half an hour ago my children were sitting 
independence day now gone to bed chuckle but also an external stomach eating is a risky business because our 
are very close to on our faces in general and so near to our eyes if got your head 
in some food spending a lot of time eating which increases the risk of you being eaten so if 
can spend less time eating then that potentially increases your survival so we predigest our food by cooking it 
spend less time chewing we spend less time eating because it is semidigested before we even put it in 
mouth so all of these things are essential parts of our development we are obligate fire users so this 
that we are the only organism that can create fire anew is different from saying that there are lots 
organisms that are dependent on fire sc yeah ar now that was a robust and good and interesting important 
until about i think it was december so my editors hate me for constantly updating books after the deadline 
passed overlapping conversation sc not gonna stop yeah ar i just need them to stop for a year so 
can catch up they just do it but it was the publication in the scientific literature of the description 
three types of australian raptors so hawks that hang around on the edges of savanna fires in western australia 
up burning twigs fly over natural or manmade fire barriers and drop them in dry areas of brush and 
they go and settle up in a tree and all of the little critters the mammals and the lizards 
run away from being burnt to death run away from these bush fires and into the mouths of the 
who have basically flushed them out now the raptors do this they flock there are hundreds of birds in 
different species so far that identified that do this and it in fact explains a lot of spontaneous fires 
occur over manmade or natural fire barriers sc yeah chuckle natural but not unintentional ar not birdproof is what 
are sc yeah chuckle ar i think another really interesting point within this which is this is published in 
scientific literature in aboriginal australians have known about this for maybe thousands of years fire raptors fire birds form 
of various dream time ceremonies some people have even speculated that this is a behavior that humans might have 
from the birds i think speculation sc very poetic i like it but yeah i buy it chuckle ar 
same if it were true this is an example of cultural transmission between species which is relatively rare but 
lovely idea i think supportable using the evidence at hand but what it does show very clearly is what 
referred to as indigenous expertise knowledge iek this is something which has been known for generations maybe hundreds maybe 
of years amongst one population for which incredibly important it gets written up in the scientific literature in and 
all sort of gulp at it because it is an incredibly cool thing sc yes ar a ridiculously cool 
but it just shows that proper engagement this is work done by bob gosford in australia proper engagement with 
with indigenous expertise results in much richer science sc right and i think one other example i wanna get 
the table while listing ways in which not as unique compared to the rest of the animal kingdom not 
using tools that we find on the ground but examples gonna correct me i hope but in your book 
think a kind of chimpanzee that not only uses spears but sharpens them when they go hunting or even 
to war with each other ar yeah sure so a lot of the great apes do this we know 
some orangutans sharpen a straight stick select a stick so another example of the thought process involved in choosing 
right stick which also corvids do as well got a way of identifying good stick for making a tool 
than a bad one and in fact a good experiment which shows that if you put so the caledonian 
in particular if you put a goodlooking hooked stick just out of reach behind a bar but you put 
not so attractive stick in reach the corvids the caledonian crows will use the first stick to fish the 
stick out so sort of meta tool use and that shows too that is complex cognition required to do 
the fongoli chimps the same ones i was talking about a minute ago in senegal they will take sticks 
they will create spears out of them sharpen them with their teeth strip them and they do this for 
specific slightly grim reason but then again nature care what we think which is that they like to eat 
babies and bush babies are nocturnal sc bush babies by the way are not human babies that are sleeping 
bushes they are a form of animal a tiny little mammal ar yes sc just so the audience knows 
an important clarification they are no less cute sc they have the big eyes yeah ar got the big 
because nocturnal they often sleep in holes in trees hollowed out holes in trees and this has been observed 
times if you strip away if you reach in and pull away the bark in order to get to 
bush babies they wake up and they run away and much lighter than chimpanzees they scamper off to the 
of the trees and the chimps get them ar the fongoli chimps take spears and what they do is 
sneak up in the trees and they will jam the spear through the bark having been sharpened with their 
and they basically kebab them and they will remove a bush baby on the stick and they will eat 
straight off the bone grim but effective sc nature ar exactly nature does not care what you think a 
good example of tool use for specific purposes for hunting again we have taken this to extraordinary extreme levels 
terms of our sophistication and tool use a darwinian phrase which i talk about a lot in the book 
lovely phrase which is he talks about humans differing by degree and not by kind ar now such an 
phrase but one that i can test in some circumstances i think cultural reasons for that darwin was right 
the where the question of whether humans had evolved from earlier apes was still very much being debated and 
he uses this phrase to say well there is continuity in whatever we look at between humans and earlier 
so we differ by a degree and not by kind i think that sometimes true in the contemporary age 
no longer debating that with other scientists and most sensible people now that we are established as evolved creatures 
can be more honest about the fact that there are some things which differ by degree and there are 
things which just are so fundamentally different that they look like they are different by kind the best example 
what doing right now speech communication sc symbolic manipulation of ideas representations ar we see that in any serious 
in any other organism attempts to teach great apes particularly coco in california died last year i think are 
absurd experiment and say much more about us than they about gorillas but even so coco had i know 
few thousand words but i do what a threeyearold does naturally which is to construct a syntactical grammatical sentence 
had no grammar yeah ar yeah and i use the example of the fact that grammar is a rulesbased 
that we continually violate the rules and kids say cute things all the time because they learn these rules 
they apply these rules to other words which actually turn out to be incorrect because we follow the rules 
example i used in the book is my daughter says rather than we swam sc blame her for that 
punish her yeah ar no you english is a stupid language a ridiculous nonrulesbased language but the fact that 
does that intuitively means that there is an innate grammatical framework which is part of the complexities of the 
the mechanics the anatomy of being able to speak combined with an enormous mainframe of processing power in which 
is an inbuilt facility i think that is not different by degree i think that is different by kind 
right and so just to wrap up here mentioned a couple of times that some of these transitions that 
point to as revolutionary cusps or turning points or whatever actually spread out over thousands or tens of thousands 
years presumably a million years from now future historians are gonna be saying the same thing about our ongoing 
revolution in the use of language and information that in the middle of right now not at the end 
it would you even dare to speculate a little bit about the future and where going given that still 
ourselves up by our bootstraps with this newfangled technique ar yeah well no is the answer to that and 
do with the time scale question so it is singularly the question that i get asked most in public 
are we still evolving now two ways to answer this the first is yes we are because evolution simply 
change over time and as long as we keep having children by sexual reproduction our children are genetically different 
us and that it is the constraints of difference and natural human variation the question i think most people 
really asking is are we evolving under the constraints of natural selection now the answer to that is there 
two ways to answer that the answer in evolutionary time scales is yes because got really clear examples over 
last years if you want which is a blink of an eye in evolutionary time scales of natural selection 
measurably in human populations all over the world there are regional adaptations in human populations which have allowed us 
become so globally successful ar a really fun example we always talk about is milkdrinking most europeans can process 
after weaning after been nursed but most people in history and most people on earth because the enzyme that 
a particular sugar in milk called lactose the called lactase basically switches off by age five in most people 
years ago or years ago a population in europe who were pastoralists already developed a mutation a random mutation 
meant that they could continue to process lactose into adulthood and that is why me and you can drink 
an interesting sideline to this which is that in the last couple of years and my next book is 
race and genetics which is now finished and will be out next year neonazis and white supremacists have taken 
genetic truism as an example of their own superiority of european sc of milkdrinking ar yeah milk chugging is 
thing and so you go on youtube and you look at milkchugging nazis and all got their tops up 
quite drunk and pouring gallons of milk all over their faces which is well a weird thing to do 
all europeans are lactosepersistent which is the condition that the evolved the derived condition that talking about they have 
to notice that lactose persistence also has independently emerged in pretty much every population that has had pastoralism as 
of its evolutionary trajectory and that includes the tutsi in rwanda the khoisan in south africa southern africa middle 
camel farmers a semiserious point that i like to make but then again we look to white supremacists for 
understanding sc not the only thing they have failed to notice so yeah ar that is true that is 
why did i mention that what were we talking about laughter sc we were talking about the future and 
the time scales are hard to get right ar oh yeah yeah right so the milkdrinking thing is a 
good example of recent evolution and local adaptation which natural selection quite the right way to think about it 
is selection but what we refer to as gene culture coevolution so our cultural behavior which is farming pastoralism 
influenced the selection of a random mutation in our genes so those two things happening at the same time 
roughly the same time which has caused that ability sc and it seems like that is the future in 
sense that now that we can not only store information in words and books and so forth and use 
to manipulate ourselves and hand it down to other people and now we can even manipulate our genomes the 
evolution of our genome will necessarily involve coevolution of what happens through natural selection and what happens through our 
information processing and gathering and sharing systems ar yes definitely true but what i think is apparent is how 
distributed these things are so the main drivers of evolution are how many children you have and how young 
die what we know very clearly is that since records were first taken about infant mortality in the century 
were very clear patterns about lowest levels of infant mortality were in northern europe mostly scandinavia and the highest 
were in western africa now two hundred years later or one hundred fifty years later the infant mortality has 
all over the world at pretty much the same rate the highest levels of infant mortality are still in 
africa and the lowest levels are still in scandinavia and america and the uk surprisingly are somewhere in the 
which i always find that a weird stat ar so that uneven distribution of this main driver of evolution 
the world may mean that there is selection in those areas but not universal we do see glimpses of 
selection or forms of selection in different populations that have been studied the technological question i think is really 
people have asked me if the advent of in vitro fertilization has shifted our trajectory the estimates are about 
million babies since since louise brown in was born have been the result of in vitro fertilization and that 
a decent chunk of people five million people if you saw them at a festival think a lot of 
less than a thousandth of the global population so relatively small but also massively unevenly distributed a very very 
technologicallybased process and so i think the answer is probably no probably not a significant contributor ar another example 
begun to manipulate the germ line of a very few diseases that have been approved so this is precrispr 
which is this new geneediting kit which i think is gonna prompt a revolution if it done already but 
chosen to eradicate a particular type of disease a mitochondrial disease where they have a separate genome we take 
mitochondria from a third individual a third adult and replace the mitochondria in children who are gonna have this 
lethal disease now again we have eradicated we have changed the direction those children would not have made it 
adulthood they would not have reproduced and that mutation would have died with them we have replaced that using 
sc yeah ar has it changed evolution almost certainly not because a tiny proportion of people for whom this 
been applied and it will never be very many people because it is a mercifully rare disease from an 
point of view i think at the point where the question is not whether we should do it whether 
do it right if we are capable of doing this then you have to ask yourself questions about why 
wanna do this rather than why you would crispr may change that we saw just before christmas what i 
is probably the greatest violation of biological ethics that i have experienced in my lifetime which was the announcement 
the birth of two girls in china who had been genetically edited via crispr by a chinese not really 
reproductive scientist at all to at an attempt to make them immune to hiv sc right ar it the 
mutation they checked he checked that it was the right mutation before it was implanted into the mother and 
that it the right mutation but implanted them anyway it is an ethical and moral violation the likes of 
i seen i think in my lifetime sc it be the last one ar it be the last one 
think it may have had the effect of unifying the community including china which is traditionally not as accessible 
terms of openness about what actually doing he was a rogue element and i think will spend the rest 
his life either in jail or the rest of his life gonna be that long right he be the 
one but well at least talking about it sc yeah yeah ar is it gonna change our future history 
think anywhere near understanding the genome well enough to actually say sc check back in five hundred years and 
what new things learned ar i would love to know where got how we got from here to there 
i will let the audience know one last thing which is that new book contains a long and highly 
section about sex that we get to talk about here lots of i think the motto is plenty of 
sex going on everywhere in the animal kingdom so the idea that sex is just for reproduction is not 
very good one we get to talk about it here but i want people to know in the book 
yeah like i say in the lectures i set out to write a book about weird animal sex it 
is a book that contains a lot of weird animal sex sc what can you do determined alright adam 
thanks so much for being on the podcast ar sean thank you for talking to me today it was 
complete pleasure i love having these longform conversations where we can really get stuck in sc alright good luck 
the book music the australian dolphin seemed to pass on a lamarckian trait to subsequent female generations evolutionary no 
really intriguing hi sean i am a fan of your show and i am a taxonomist i have thought 
some time that it would be good for you to have a taxonomist on the show to talk about 
sciences of taxonomy and biosystematics which are foundational disciplines in biology that are woefully underfunded and often misunderstood i 
that this current episode with adam had such a misunderstanding and highlights the need for you to have a 
on your podcast while you talk about one definition of a species ie biological species definition popularised by mayr 
is not the most widely accepted today by taxonomists and does not work for many organisms you can read 
paper by kevin de queiroz wherein he describes the various species definitions and the idea of a unified species 
ie species as independently evolving metapopulation lineages in this concept a number of criteria can be used to delimit 
and any single criterion eg populations not interbreeding is not necessary but may be sufficient for the recognition of 
species a crucial idea within taxonomy that was missed is that a taxon is an hypothesis your example of 
neanderthalensis is a good example of how new data eg dna can lead to changes in species taxonomy that 
have been previously based on only one kind of data eg morphology this is not a flaw of taxonomy 
rather the process of taxonomy it would be great for you to have a taxonomist on your podcast to 
this and talk further about modern taxonomy phylogenetics species discovery etc i would be happy to recommend a few 
that would be great to have on cheers tim fantastic conversation seriously mind expanding know how he does it 
often sean gets just the right interview for an intellegent audience great stuff just finished i love the idea 
presented that it was the flow of information that contributed to the changes in us sapiens leading up to 
years ago another book we are and how we got by david reich described the flow of genes in 
populations his thoughts were that north africa was a fertile area in last several years allowing for people and 
to intermix leading to who we are of cultural and knowledge mixing adds another element to the story i 
all the mindscape podcasts but this had the additional benefit of combining it with another regular podcast of mine 
presented by adam it was great to hear him answering the questions for a change and i loved the 
ranging nature of the conversation the ability to explore topics indepth and in this way is such a benefit 
the podcast medium keep up the great work sean i always get adam rutherford muddled up with tim harford 
great presenters on bbc radio tims hosts more or less in case wondering really looking forward to this podcast 
reading humanimal cheers hi sean a undergraduate physics student and regular listener to your podcast i just completed a 
of all episodes of mindscape yay and think that an interesting topic for you to do in the future 
be let the judgementeye rolling toward the firstyear undergrad commence psychoactive drugs a topic equalparts science philosophy and culture 
with the right interviewee i think be right up your alley research that was once widely prohibited for very 
though usually absurd reasons is now for the first time in history being conducted and the departure of the 
and medical categorisation of psychoactives as either medically useful or illegal and dangerous has begun anyway love the show 
looking forward to next episode ps a few recommendations michael pollan robin carhartharris hamilton morris i listen to all 
podcasts from bbc radio four and love them love his great sense of humour that comes through on the 
cases of rutherford and fry and i love podcasts what a treat to have my two favourite podcasters come 
fantastic comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts
