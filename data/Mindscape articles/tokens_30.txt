the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today is one of those episodes that brings you a guest 
people have been hoping and expecting to get on the podcast for a long time that would be max 
cosmologist and physicist professor at mit known max for a long time in addition to being a physicist also 
of the cofounders of the foundational questions institute which we talked a little bit about with its other cofounder 
aguirre a few podcasts back and also a cofounder of the future of life institute as well as a 
author and public speaker max sort of made his bones physicswise by studying the largescale structure of the universe 
the cosmic microwave background worked with some of the largest and most important experimental projects as an analyst as 
theorist taking the data from these projects and asking what we can learn about the universe but his interests 
very broad worked in the foundations of quantum mechanics and most recently been interested in artificial intelligence his most 
book is called life being human in the age of artificial intelligence and we will talk a little bit 
his most recent work in creating artificial intelligence that acts like a physicist sc but his previous book was 
our mathematical universe and that put forward a theory of a very very big multiverse a bigger multiverse than 
cosmologists ever think about one in which all mathematical structures are somehow real so that will be the focus 
most of conversation working up to from our universe to the multiverse why you would think that what it 
means the big cosmic questions that we like to dig out teeth into here at the mindscape podcast remember

pleasure to be here sc now of the many things known for the multiverse is certainly one of them 
just wrote a book on quantum mechanics in many worlds so one of the very first questions i get 
give to you what is the multiverse what is the relationship to many worlds what are all these words 
mean mt so before we start talking about other universes be clear on what we mean by we mean 
of space when we in astrophysics say we actually just mean the spherical part of space from which light 
had time to reach us so far during the billion years since our big bang and huge it has 
to the power of seventyeight particles in it and huge numbers of galaxies but certainly not infinite and if 
call that our universe or observable universe and space goes on for beyond that which is what the simplest 
of what created our big bang predicts the inflation theory then there are other universes just like it i 
that level one sc so but other universe in that sense it means more of the same but further 
out of contact with earth mt exactly there just could be other people living on some galaxy one hundred 
light years away when they look around they see us because light from us reached them and someone might 
that theory you have that earth exists with sean carroll is just philosophical sc unprovable yeah mt but all 
of the same space and then if you take seriously this inflation theory the simplest versions of them actually 
that space just big and much bigger than we can see but actually infinite and moreover that the distribution 
stuff in space started out kind of randomly from place to place which means that no matter how unlikely 
is that the particles would have started out in such a way that sean carroll and max tegmark would 
along billion years later and have this conversation the probability zero since it happened and that means if you 
the dice again an infinite number of times it will happen again somewhere else and you can even crudely 
how far you have to go until you get to the nearest copy of this universe about a googolplex 
where a googolplex is one with a googol zeros and a googol is one with a hundred zeros after 
mt it sounds pretty crazy but actually much less crazy that what conclude if you take this inflation theory 
because it actually says that there are parts of this space most likely which just really far away and 
we get there but where the laws of physics you would learn in school will be the same but 
would you learn in history class would be different because basically the particles started out differently so things happened 
but where you might actually learn things in physics class too i call that a level two multiverse and 
way you might get convinced to take that seriously is if you both trust people like alan guth and 
linde who say that this inflation thingy happened and you also take seriously the idea that the laws of 
might have more than one solution for what a uniform space can look like we know the case for 
it can be solid ice or a liquid water or steam string theorists say the space we live in 
be like that too except there might be more than three maybe more than a googol ways it could 
this is a pretty general phenomena in physics if you have some complicated equations they can have multiple solutions 
inflation is such a violent process that it just create a lot of space but really sort of jostled 
around so violently that quite possible that it created not just lots of one solution for how space can 
but huge amounts of many different solutions and we might be tricked into thinking that the solution that we 
in is the only kind because all we ever see but that will be just as dumb a conclusion 
if some fish in the caribbean concludes that all water is in liquid form because all seen if it 
up to greenland it would see icebergs and realize that so level two multiverse more diverse sc actually let 
dwell on something about the level one multiverse because i think it does get glossed over a little bit 
one multiverse just imagine space is infinite the universe is open and this is something that cosmologists have contemplated 
since been doing the expanding universe right and just from that one idea it more or less follows that 
infinite copy of people like you laughter mt almost i would say sc almost mt you could still have 
idea which newton and einstein originally flirted with that maybe space went on forever even euclid thought two thousand 
ago but there was only stuff in a small region of it and then the rest is just as 
void where nothing was happening but inflation torpedoes that idea because it says actually all of the space is 
with stuff in it and also not just the same thing piled over and over again but it starts 
kind of randomly in such a way that all initial conditions get realized somewhere so i agree with you 
you put together these two ideas infinite space and that you do all the possible initial conditions for them 
really forced into this conclusion that everything gets realized which is quite shocking laughter when you first contemplate it 
because long before if you trail onto space we get to that other conversation between sean carroll and max 
a googolplex meters away but you get the other ones where interviewing max schmegmark and max pegmark about his 
playing and also some other variations of our lives and some people really like that sc and this is 
conversation that been had in the right this is not like modern superduper crazy cosmology the idea that open 
universe could have been taken more seriously years ago mt yeah and it was pretty violently attacked even before 
anyone who listens to this if you go to rome go to campo fiori and a statue there with 
bruno who was burnt at the stake right there the year for talking about an infinite universe with other 
systems and so on sc for doing a bunch of things including that historians who wanna nitpick about exactly 
reasons mt sure sc his tongue was cut out and he was burned at the stake but that was 
one of them mt but i would argue that chuckle there were no scientific claims who should get burnt 
the stake sc okay but good so level one already has some weird philosophical implications and this many copies 
me and level two is that also many different versions of the local laws of physics far away mt 
just to add to that i think important to remember that the things that we were taught to be 
of physics as fundamental the more we study them we realize that a lot of those are actually not 
and information is more just part of your address in the sense that if you have a tshirt one 
which has the theory of everything on it which hopefully you shawn will discover one day right chuckle would 
expect to have a big eight on there and if i ask you the eight and like eight the 
of planets in the solar that will be pretty weird because be like there are all the other solar 
out there too with two planets five so the eight telling us anything fundamental about space telling us something 
our address in space sc right you think that the average temperature of the air on earth is a 
quantity of nature mt we sc and environmental mt we but we did think for a long time that 
number one thousand eight hundred thirtysix was kind of fundamental how many times heavier the proton is than the 
right oh fundamental and then a lot of our string theory friends tell actually they have a googol different 
and in one of them they can probably come up with another one where that number is so maybe 
just part of our address in fact there are so far thirtytwo pure numbers that found dimensionless numbers with 
that seem to describe everything we in theory can try to predict about our world maybe all just part 
our address also sc yup all right good we need a level three multiverse then clearly mt yeah so 
one comes not from studying the very big out there in our physical space but from studying very small 
the elementary particles they were all made out of where in this princeton grad student hugh everett came up 
this incredibly radical suggestion earlier people had already realized that electrons for example and other subatomic particles seem to 
schizophrenic in a way in the sense they can be in many places at once and people had really 
over backwards to try to explain that away for example the danish physicist niels bohr said basically there are 
questions not allowed to ask about nature chuckle mt as a swedish person i am honorbound to always make 
of the danes and i think hamlet was on to something when he said something rotten in the state 
but everett said no bs actually going on is sure these particles can be in several places at once 
that means that since we are made of those particles we can also be in several places at and 
instead of just freaking out and having a stiff drink he continued thinking through what it would feel like 
it were really were that way and he realized that i make a measurement of a particle in two 
at once and in advance decided that if here gonna go for a drink and if in the other 
then gonna watch netflix instead mt what gonna feel like is that there are gonna be two different versions 
max now and one has a drink one watches netflix and gonna be unaware of each other and gonna 
to them that there was just something random that happened they discovered the particle was this way or that 
and then life went on and we actually have known for many years that things seemed to be kind 
random in quantum physics and he said that is the explanation everett said randomness is just the way it 
subjectively whenever you get cloned so to speak and people still argue fiercely about this as you sc i 
know yes mt over a hundred years after quantum sc mindscape listeners know mt but i think important to 
that this weirdness is so fundamental it has nothing to do necessarily even with quantum mechanics if we just 
across the river here to the mgh hospital they have a cloning device purely classically where they just sedate 
and then they make and actual copy they put all these atoms together in exactly the same pattern and 
told in advance that the next day one of you is gonna wake up in room one and the 
gonna wake up in room two the next morning both of the seans wake up and they go out 
the hospital room and look at the number on their door right what do you predict that gonna experience 
you predict that gonna experience a one or a two what would you say sc i would say i 
an argument for this but you know mt gonna feel random to you though right sc yes exactly mt 
gonna be nothing you can do to predict your subjective future experience although the doctors would claim there was 
random that actually happened all they did was cloned you i think personally that everett was onto something here 
likely that the yet again our reality is really bigger than we thought and that there is nothing truly 
actually happening in nature and the things that seem random come from us having been cloned in this sense 
even if this probably sounds even weirder than the level one and level two when you look at the 
of diversity you get in this which i call the level three multiverse actually smaller or no bigger than 
other ones just that you get all of the same parallel worlds sort of all over again in a 
way sc you get them much faster in some sense i mean happening all the time in this room 
the universe is just branching off in pieces mt yeah and in some way also more connected to some 
those parallel branches because if you are upset that you got a parking ticket you might realize that another 
that actually was identical to you up until maybe ten minutes ago and quite recently only branched out so 
can take more solace maybe in the fact sc does that make you feel better really mt ah it 
the pressure off to get things right all the time sc it make me feel any different but for 
or for worse but you know mt it does i reflected a lot on this before my first son 
born i was hoping things were gonna go well and then i started thinking i have to try to 
my emotions with my scientific views because what i even mean when i say hoping if there are parallel 
where things are gonna go great and things where gonna end in tragedy right so then maybe what i 
maybe what really hoping is that gonna be in a parallel universe where things go well with this birth 
then i realized no stupid because gonna be in all of them sc yeah exactly be a version of 
in all of them mt maybe i mean that i hope the probability of i hope that in most 
gonna go well but also bs because if really smart just a number you could calculate from quantum mechanics 
fraction of the worlds it goes well so how can i hope for something for some fraction being large 
saying hope that pi is bigger than or something either it is or it sc but this is just 
free will question these would all be questions in a deterministic newtonian universe where you just know what the 
holds is there still the possibility of hope mt so i think in the end i ended up kind 
where you are it feels pretty cool to be in this universe and sometimes useful to have those heuristics 
hope even if you know kind of on thin ice when you say things like that sc hope comes 
imperfect information mt yeah sc okay so level three the everettian multiple worlds of quantum mechanics and separate from 
level two cosmological multiverse where things are different and the typical speculative theoretical physicists stops at three but you 
not be stopped gonna go on gonna say that a level four mt right so of course most people 
go to level one giordano bruno got burned and not just on the job market but literally become more 
since now that we can see so far with our telescopes and since inflation has caught on even level 
has gotten a bit more normalized and moved from the ridicule to taken seriously albeit controversial even level three 
to see how gone from being first utterly ignored to being violently attacked to being actually regularly voted as 
of the top interpretations if you talk to people who study quantum foundations so sort of respectably controversial in 
sense that people argue about it at conferences rather than just in bars right the level four on the 
sc sorry we now raise a whole other issue which gotta get right so i personally would put a 
possibility on level three really existing than on level two i think that better reason to believe in the 
multiverse than there is in the cosmological multiverse and i maybe very roughly for everett and for the cosmological 
do you have different credences yourself mt with at the risk of being boring i think i would agree 
you on this because there are fewer assumptions behind the everettian one really all you need is to assume 
just the shorting of equations of how they are in my office with no little footnote to the ifs 
buts and this is not valid when someone observes it which not gonna define for you just equation boom 
to get the level two multiverse you really need to assume both inflation and some fundamental string theory that 
multiple solutions like string or loop quantum gravity and neither of those two are things that we that we 
be anywhere near sure of at this point sc okay good just checking so we can get on to 
four now mt yeah so level four this is an extremely unpopular kind of multiverse sc this is your 
to convince me mt very few people who take it seriously sc you have listeners ready to be convinced 
yeah so the idea here is so the way i got into this was first of all by just 
fascinated by the effectiveness of mathematics in describing the physical world so well and many people in the physics 
especially theorists like you sean will say our universes is really accurately described by mathematics approximated at least maybe 
exactly described but then you have to ask what is the difference really between being perfectly described by math 
just being math after all mathematicians they also have this language of mathematics that they use to describe mathematical 
like the cube sphere like some calabiyau manifold whatnot and what modern mathematicians have increasingly done is trying to 
out everything but just this brute formalism where they just described different kinds of mathematical objects you can make 
type of mathematical family tree which i had fun doing in my book all these different mathematical structures mt 
are the integers here are the real numbers the complex numbers here is here is this threeplus onedimensional pseudo 
and manifold you can go on putting things with all sorts of weird names but all the fundamentally the 
kind of thing things that can be described purely abstractly with mathematical symbols and no human sort of baggage 
if you look at the math that way at math space in that way that there was this very 
question which is why would and stephen words stephen asked why would god breathe fire into one of these 
and make a universe for them to describe and not others or what breaks the symmetry why is this 
one supposed to describe our world different from all the others so the level four multiverse comes from this 
radical conjecture that actually there is none of that math metaphysics laughter mt there is no special fire breathing 
or whatever all of these mathematical objects exist in exactly the same sort of way and we just happened 
be living in one of them one of them complex enough that parts of it can feel subjectively where 
on there and so studying physics or to just break it down to plain english what really saying is 
we live in a mathematical structure a mathematical object which is something which has only mathematical properties and are 
have to stop and say well that sounds completely nutty what do i mean you see the moose here 
we have a moose on the table in front of us a little moose doll mt yeah i was 
a gift today sc not a true moose mt what what do i mean this has only mathematical properties 
sc look at sc made of cloth has colorful garb mt squishy a little bit blue and moose like 
those properties i just described sound very mathematical at all but when we look at it sean through our 
eyes we see that actually a blob of quarks and electrons and what properties does an electron have it 
the property minus one one half one and so on we physicists have made up these nerdy names for 
properties like electric charge spin lepton number but just we humans who invented that language of calling them that 
are really just numbers and you know as well as i do that the only difference between an electron 
a top quark is what numbers its properties are we have not discovered any other properties that they actually 
so the stuff in space all the different particles in the standard model written so much nice stuff about 
your books are all described by just by sets of numbers what about the space that in what property 
the space have i think i actually have your old nerdy nonpopular right laughter sc my unpopular book yes 
space has for example the property three a number and we have a nerdy name for that too we 
it the dimensionality of space the maximum number of fingers i can put in space that are all perpendicular 
each other the name dimensionality is just the human language thing the property is three we also discovered that 
has some other properties like curvature and topology that einstein was interested in but those are all mathematical properties 
and as far as we know today in physics we have never discovered any properties of either space or 
stuff in space yet that are actually nonmathematical and then it starts to feel a little bit less insane 
maybe we are living in a mathematical object not so different from if you were a character living in 
video game and you started to analyze how your world worked you would secretly be discovering just the mathematical 
of the code right sc yeah an intelligently designed environment but yes mt it is yep i guess we 
talk about the probability that we are living in a simulation also later but if that is in fact 
case that living in a mathematical object then what about the other mathematical objects that happened to also be 
defined why should we get on our high horses and say they exist as much as ours can maybe 
stillborn because not complicated enough or whatnot but you could say the same thing even about those other less 
kinds of the universe anyway so the level four multiverse in a nutshell simply math space space of all 
objects that exist and if this is true the first prediction it makes is that all the properties of 
universe even the ones we yet been able to understand to do with intelligence and consciousness for example should 
also succumb to mathematical description sc but just to be clear maybe it sneaked under the radar there we 
imagine the space of all mathematical structures but making the extra statement that all equally real and we just 
in one of them is that fair mt right sc the level four multiverse mt right i really wanna 
out as much human baggage as possible from this and that saying that something is real or not what 
it even mean laughter sc i think it means something mt well it means something if you have this 
of very pagan kind of idea that this moose is real made of stuff real right but then we 
and looked as physicists again and just made of all the stuff is just these elementary particles and what 
their properties all mathematical so you what is there here really beyond all these mathematical properties yet to be 
i have a lot usually when people start trying to persuade me of things beyond that it starts to 
very much like some sort of new agey thing they just want there to be something fluffy and the 
and nonmathematical they think mathematics is cool enough or they say things like i believe just i object to 
derogatory use of the word sc sure i will definitely go along with that but i do wanna maybe 
should be phrased as a question can we sensibly distinguish between the idea that our universe is just a 
structure and that all mathematical structures are equally real no matter what you might mean by the word but 
least no difference in the level of reality between ours and others otherwise not really a multiverse mt right 
are two separate questions there first of all does our universe have some nonmathematical properties or not we know 
if you had gone back four hundred years and had galileo on your podcast then it would have seemed 
course it has nonmathematical the only stuff that we could even predict at all with physics was motion galileo 
throw a hazelnut then a grape and he could tell you that gonna move in this parabolashaped y x 
but he tell you why the grape was green and the hazelnut was brown that seemed nonmathematical he predict 
the grape was soft and the hazelnut was hard because that seem nonmathematical it was to do with the 
nature of stuff right but then we got equations which helped us understand light and colors and even that 
of reality succumbed to the mathematical description and then we got quantum mechanics which explains now why the grape 
soft and the hazelnut is hard and gone from having a situation where the whole world seemed just mostly 
and the only thing we could predict about it was motion mathematically to a situation where we can actually 
math to almost everything except maybe intelligence and consciousness the final holdout sc well i did have a podcast 
with philip goth who is a panpsychist and the name of his book was literally he says that galileo 
an error in making things too mathematical now plug your book mathematical which says the opposite so people can 
both books and decide which one is more persuasive sc i changed the title in the last second from 
to mathematical because i thought saying would be very arrogant like you say solar it sort of implies that 
only one right sc true mt whereas if you think seriously that there could be other universes this is 
mt okay wait but we got distracted because you were making a sales pitch for something i already agree 
namely that our universe is mathematical but what about the others the reality level of the others mt how 
you make this jump from saying there so one mathematical structure which happens to be existing also physically this 
how do you then get to the much stronger conclusion that all the other mathematically ones also have a 
existence so the first part i call it mathematical universe which is that our external reality out there which 
believe exists and will continue to exist even if we all died that it is purely mathematical and sorry 
call that the external reality hypotheses that exists and then i have an argument for why it should be 
but then a separate logical step which you raise here how do you get from that to the idea 
actually all the other ones also exist i probably bore you with getting into that too much in this 
but what i argue in the book is you basically just have to add a you can take some 
structure and just study it very carefully what are all the properties that it has right sc mmhmm mt 
you can say this here is this thing gonna be selfaware it has information processing like this and if 
smart you can figure out how ai works and consciousness and whatever you could figure out even how the 
some cells where parts of this will subjectively experience themselves in there and you might find one that looks 
like ours you might find some other ones and then you come to this question of if gonna claim 
this one here that corresponds to our universe exists physically also and some other one sc yeah mt what 
you actually mean by that positing that there is some additional property that this has which has nothing to 
with the math which is whether it exists physically or not somehow but there this is nowhere to be 
in the math a little bit like if you try to convince somebody that they have a soul and 
ask you does my soul weigh i measure its existence with these particle and you say and then they 
you does the soul actually push my particles around and make me act differently and like the soul has 
effect at all on your particles but it still right then you say that making yourself a little bit 
vulnerable to razor mt they could just say gonna take everything you say sean and just shave off the 
part it have any additional explanatory i feel that so just that someone might say that the soul there 
like a little fairy dust been sprinkled on but that it really add anything explanatory you could say the 
thing about this idea that this extra magical property that a mathematical structure has called physical existence but it 
any effect on the mathematical relations it hold within it at all and i can ask you does that 
anything about whether these two lines that are parallel are gonna cross or and you say it have any 
on whether this self aware object here is gonna experience x or mt like so it has no effect 
any other relations in there that to me also is just as vulnerable to razor now it sounds like 
philosophical bs really that has no consequences on any other mathematical relations and i would just my guess is 
we it is just philosophical hogwash and we should just accept the fact that regardless of whether something is 
computer simulation or exists in some other way all that matters about it is how the what the relations 
within it what determines how it feels like to live in it so there you have it basically a 
universe and if this leads very naturally into this question about whether living in a computer simulation also because 
and i were arguing about whether in a simulation right now and like no way because this moose here 
feels real right mt physically real and if we were in a computer simulation the moose would not feel 
how would you respond to my argument sc yeah a dopey argument right mt claiming that my argument is 
the same argument but the way i experience the moose max the computer game character here has only to 
with what the mathematical properties are of this computer simulation has nothing to do with whether being simulated on 
mac or a windows machine or a unix machine just internal mathematical properties of this simulation that matter i 
say the same with the mathematical structure all that matters are the relations in it not whether some philosopher 
that sort of made of real stuff or not sc so i certainly delete forget whether i buy it 
not irrelevant but i understand the argument that it is absolutely a simpler idea to imagine that all mathematical 
exist than to imagine that we can conceive of all mathematical structures and we are one of them a 
of information that goes into pinpointing which one we are which happy to get rid of but then i 
and at the risk of getting a little bit technical here it would seem that to make sense of 
idea you need some kind of way of comparing the different kinds of universes the different kinds of mathematical 
so many that look like this some many that look like that and i would also think that once 
had that way of comparing far more universes that look like ours and then explode into chaos a second 
then to keep up this very very specific obeyance to the laws of physics so your theory make a 
that all gonna cease to exist within a nano second mt as both my brain would a very good 
i think the answer is no for reasons explain in a sec but first of all totally open to 
possibility that this idea is wrong and very interested in testing it in various ways i think to me 
idea is more of an inspiration for a research program to try to find more mathematical regularities never gonna 
any if we look for them right if we say consciousness is off limits because not mathematical not gonna 
any equations that might actually help explain and say in terms of your question about whether the most generic 
we should expect is just random weird stuff taking place i have a suspicion that just like in at 
in cosmology when we study infinite spaces and so on we stress out a lot about the socalled measure 
to which things exists sort of more often or to a greater extent than others but there is something 
similar to that unsolved problem here and i think it has gonna have a lot to do with complexity 
some sense maybe very simple mathematical structures that are simple to describe get more weight if you were just 
bored and simulated different universes on your future super computer the simpler ones would get a lot more attention 
the more complicated ones because they could be evaluated much faster right mt i sometimes wonder this is a 
quarterbaked idea but if the reason why our universe seems remarkably simple when you look at the fundamental laws 
have to do with that that simplicity is very much favored and if true then we just expect that 
past has been simple but we should also expect the future should be kind of simple because much more 
to write to define a simulation algorithm or a mathematical structure where suddenly a pink giraffe appears randomly in 
office right then to just specify the standard model that we have today where probably not gonna happen sc 
that you i mean sure as far as that goes yes if there were an additional principle that would 
favor simplicity you might be able to account for our universe simple enough a little complicated but a simple 
you might hope for that but i do worry that another metaphysical principle that you are just trying to 
mere moments ago gone away from the pure pristine beauty of everything mathematical exists all there is to it 
so first of all i try to be very humble so not saying i believe that nowadays universities exist 
job as a scientist to belief stuff happy to make bets though sc one has credences a good basis 
and second whether you feel that something is frivolous and full of extra assumptions are complicated or not depends 
lot on what you mean by simple many people criticize any kind of parallel universe as being wasteful because 
waste a lot of atoms buy this idea that space is infinite or bigger than we can see because 
my gosh all these extra a different perspective is that simplicity be measured by how simple the mathematical equations 
it turns out much easier to write down some physics equations than to actually give us this big space 
then to write inflation that makes a really small space which is exactly as big as we can see 
then magically stops sc yeah mt and the same thing seen in quantum mechanics where it turns out to 
much easier to have this schrodinger equation that just has all these parallel worlds than to add in a 
of extra stuff supposed to get rid of all the parallel worlds and i feel in the same sense 
the levelfour multiverse is actually simpler we were joking about a tshirt earlier when you write down the theory 
everything right so if you did that two thousand years ago oh boy would you have to have a 
font have to say now living in a system as a blahblahblah and then this is what the garlic 
like this is what a watermelon and this is copper and the periodic if you just fast forward a 
bit they they have to specify the whole periodic table they could just write down this equation for qcd 
chromodynamics and three numbers and from them you can compute the principle the whole periodic table and books full 
numbers about how atoms shine light in different colors and stuff mt so more simplicity now and then i 
by going to the leveltwo multiverse you even have to write down numbers like proton electron mass ratio of 
thousand eight hundred thirtysix because that have to go on the tshirt your address you find out if you 
know where living you go measure that now you know what part of the leveltwo multiverse in and the 
multiverse economizes even more because without it you have to put on your tshirt at least the equations for 
theory or a loop quantum gravity or whatever the correct quorum gravity is you have to put that in 
levelfour multiverse you could just wear a black tshirt with nothing on it because all of the mathematical structures 
and you can try to catalog with a future computer program exists and kind of all to it sc 
want to dwell on this too much but it sounds a lot to me like library right jorge said 
this library that literally contains books with every possible sequence of symbols and somewhere in that library are all 
works of shakespeare and the bible and for that matter every book ever written in the future right the 
is finding them the problem is that the card catalogue is the same size as the library most of 
books are utter nonsense mt yeah and another problem really no structure in it there is no sense in 
simple books are more important than complicated books so the average generic book is just pure garbage so different 
mathematical structures is actually very hard to write down the system of axioms and the theorem that are even 
at all so the great mathematician david hilbert one said that mathematical existence is simply freedom from contradiction and 
turns out to be it is really hard to do that so some people like to say that know 
exists if you kick it and it takes sc yeah chuckle mt mathematical structures are a lot like that 
if plato for example was really interested in regular shapes and he discovered that there are five of them 
the platonic solids the cube icosahedron etcetra right and no matter how hard he tried he just make up 
sixth one there just one he could make up names for them but he make up more so in 
sense mathematics kind of kicks back he discovered the dodecahedron made up of twelve pentagons and thought that was 
cool that they tell anyone they thought it had magic powers and see it sometimes in art museums in 
corner of some paintings discovering that shape was a little bit like when we discovered the planet neptune felt 
it was out there all along and how we found it so this math space is much more interesting 
library in the sense that a lot of stuff in it but but actually not the case it just 
exists not like some people sometimes criticize social sciences for being very loose and looseygoosey about things mt if 
just take some random mathematical structure and just add one more axiom to it often like pops the balloon 
the whole thing just collapses to nothing sc so would it leaning on simplicity quite a bit and also 
to the idea that everything that we do see in our physical universe is just running on some computer 
in super advanced civilization is that simpler or more complicated mt i would actually bet against the fact that 
in a simulation not because i think impossible but because i think less likely so nick bostrom bostrom as 
call him in swedish popularized this so called simulation argument and what he basically said was building ever better 
one day be able to have much more simulated minds than real minds so therefore we should expect ourselves 
be a simulated i claim that that argument is actually flawed in the last step and you can see 
sort of start falling apart already by just taking it one step further suppose you agree with it so 
there is some sort of basement universe with actual physical stuff but not in there in one of their 
simulations nothing prevents us from making the same argument again in our simulated world gonna have more simulated computers 
gonna do doubly simulated minds and outnumber us so therefore doubly simulated and that we can do it again 
simulated now simulated a trillion times are you getting a sinking feeling at this point sc laughter well i 
go ahead and finish the argument is it just that we should be infinitely simulated is that the argument 
what the simulation argument logically implies that basically infinitely simulated which already feels a little bit fishy and i 
i had the flip side of that argument mt uhhuh sc which is that according to that logic the 
majority of beings should be in the lowest resolution simulations right just the easiest to make and a bit 
win but empirically we see i mean easy for us to make simulations and so we could easily have 
resolution than what we see around us therefore some logical flaw mt i like that too and there was 
an interesting paper a while back where they had tried to look for evidence that simulated like finding weird 
and things sc they find any by the way for readers out there mt yeah but i think where 
argument goes wrong very interesting what saying is you should have this basement reality it has some laws of 
in it where real stuff and in that basement reality if you can there make the argument that most 
in there are gonna be simulated sure now onto something maybe but we know that in the basement reality 
if we conclude in the end they were simulated then we have immediately violated that assumption and we have 
idea in that case what basement reality actually simulated in so the thing that would matter the only thing 
could make this argument work is if you knew for sure that you were in the basement reality so 
can make some statements about actually probable sc yeah but just to be very mt and then you sc 
on board with the idea that maybe maybe not everyone listening is on board on your side here life 
a simulation would be just as real as life in the basement reality right i mean you could simulate 
no substrate dependence the people in the simulation could in principle have all the hopes and dreams and consciousness 
you and i have mt i wanna be humble here i mean there are many people who think that 
is something mysterious about intelligence thinking that it can only exist in biological organisms such as us that exists 
of in the basement reality but i am not to respond to that viewpoint i call it carbon chauvinism 
the other you can only be smart if made of carbon atoms i think in fact exactly the opposite 
carbon chauvinism is giving us the whole ai revolution the opposite of carbon chauvinism is the idea that intelligence 
consciousness are all about information processing and it just matter whether the information is processed by carbon atoms in 
and brains or by silicon atoms in technology or some other kind of particles in technology and if you 
that that all about information processing then of course an entity in a really good simulation with the right 
of information processing is gonna feel the same way they would feel if that information processing happened on some 
substrate right and just like they will have no idea of knowing whether this simulated on a mac or 
machine or linux machine they will have no idea of way to tell whether actually simulated at all or 
in an actual physical universe that has those laws sc and so would you say so not to put 
in your mouth tell me if this is accurate possible conceivable that we are living in somebody simulation so 
people who buy that the response that i and a response that i think unlikely for the following logical 
sounds like saying you think unlikely but you would be interested in caring if you thought that it was 
mt oh totally i agree with all you said i think we might be i have not seen a 
argument for why we are and i think a little bit of evidence experimental evidence against since it seems 
the quality of this one is a bit higher than it would need to be although sometimes when i 
attention to politics but that aside if you still have a lingering doubt that you are simulated the advice 
pretty clear just live a really interesting life so those running the simulation get bored and shut you down 
how do we know interesting to them this is the question also flip it mt but you seem to 
doing it right since you been turned off yet sc as far as i know the thing about being 
a simulation is they can always hit a save point and shut down the simulation and start you up 
later who knows how many times happened in our lifetime right mt indeed indeed sc the clock in our 
need not be the clock in their universe this is where it gets scary but turn it around if 
simulation theory is true then there are super beings in the basement reality who have built a computer and 
simulating mt and then the intelligent design that you despise so much is true sc right exactly but then 
about the other way around what about us building simulations with ais in them i had bellehany mitchell in 
podcast recently a bit of a skeptic about ability to reach human levels of intelligence at least near term 
in principle but how close we are what is your feeling to how close we are this is kind 
what doing these days doing more ai than cosmology mt yeah my research group here at mit been doing 
research for the last bunch of years and so if you look at minority papers published in the ai 
and ai conferences sc and by the way is that more a response to the state of cosmology or 
state of ai or the state of max mt oh a good question i think a little bit of 
the first actually ever since i was a teenager been just really fascinated by the biggest questions the bigger 
better and i remember thinking back then that the biggest mysteries of all were our universe out there and 
universe in there in your head so i spent the first twentyfive years of my career around the outer 
super exciting and in recent years just felt ever more intrigued by the second part and i realized that 
only that this pace is picking up so much that really fun now but also that we physicists have 
lot of contribute to that field in ways we can come back but to get me back on track 
asked a question before you asked that sc sorry what is your statement what is your feeling about the 
of the progress mt more interesting than what i think is what ai researchers have said across the world 
recent surveys which is that most of them guess ai will succeed within the matter of decades to get 
which is an acronym for artificial general intelligence which means ai that can do all intellectual tasks at least 
well as us super intelligence is something way beyond that in turn are we is that actually gonna happen 
course a lot of people who dismiss it and say about it not gonna happen ever because impossible because 
is something mysterious and all those people say about information or barking up the wrong tree maybe right i 
guess that wrong and just as in any field you have a genuine scientific controversy about how fast or 
things are gonna be but i think it will be a mistake to dismiss it that possible sure we 
many embarrassing examples of scientists being overoptimistic of how quickly things are gonna happen remember when you and i 
both starting grad school fusion was forty years away sc oh yeah mt still forty years away sc but 
the other hand we thought never know the density of the universe mt yeah now we sc hard to 
the future mt times squared times ten minus twentysix kilograms square meters and gone for about the age of 
universe from arguing whether ten or twenty billion years to arguing about whether or so progress and so very 
to say something is impossible when on a planet with a lot of smart motivated people for example earnest 
one of your physics heroes father of nuclear physics famously said that this idea of getting nuclear energy moonshine 
you know how long it took from when he said that in a lecture in london until leos lard 
the neutron chain reaction sc it have been that long a decade mt less than twentyfour hours sc oh 
mt so we have to the bottomline i think is you just have to have an open mind it 
happen in decades it could be a bit sooner it could be take much longer but i think if 
few decades away that already makes it arguably even more urgent than thinking about climate change and your retirement 
this is gonna be a much bigger deal obviously if it happens if some human you like very much 
about your least favorite politician or unscrupulous business tycoon has this and can use it to take control of 
and impose what they think is cool on you you might not be so stoked about that right sc 
sorry just i want that to go by too quickly for the people out there this is the worry 
artificial general intelligence that it will give either the ai itself or the people controlling that ai some version 
super powers that will be hard to control for the rest of us and therefore we should worry a 
about ai gone wrong mt right and i think the reason i decided to start my ai book life 
a little fiction story was exactly of this hollywood gets us worried always about the wrong thing always robots 
have to have something they can film because a visual medium intelligence itself can confer a great power why 
it that humans have more power on this planet than tigers is it because we have sharper claws or 
biceps no smarter and that means of course that if someone can amplify their intelligence with vastly stronger ai 
can confer enormous power on them they can pretty quickly outsmart others on the stock market and out patent 
and out argue them on your blog and whatever and have a lot of influence mt and is that 
or bad well that entirely depends on how controlled and with what goals i think like any technology of 
ai will be a doubleedged sword people sometimes ask me if against ai or for it i usually counter 
asking them if about fire are they against it or for it a dumb question the interesting question is 
can you do to get the upside of fire but not the downside it turns out a lot that 
can do why we have fire extinguishers and fire escapes and we teach our kids to not blah blah 
blah mt that to me is the most interesting question important question of our time i think how are 
gonna harness this technology to make sure it gets used to cure cancer and lift people out of poverty 
help life flourish like never before hopefully not just during the next election cycle but for billions of years 
maybe not just on this planet but throughout much of our universe it could be awesome on the other 
you have to think too long to envision scenarios where not so great for starters you just again envision 
least favorite politician using it to impose their will on everybody you even have to get the things where 
ai itself breaks out and takes over just a lot of people you probably want it to control you 
so i had the following worry which i really put in front of ai experts such as yourself yet 
going to be ai at all it is gonna need the ability to learn and therefore to change itself 
an intrinsic issue with the idea of controlling it you can tell it not to do something but if 
decides to change his mind what are we gonna do about it mt this is very active research in 
today how to actually take deep learning systems which have learned stuff and where you really understand in detail 
they work is there some way nonetheless by having a better architectures who actually prove that always gonna do 
things it breaks into three different nerd problems which are all unsolved but which we all also face as 
i would say we want the ai first to understand our goals and then adopt our goals and then 
them our little babies first are too dumb to understand most of our goals and then teenagers wanna adopt 
goals but fortunately our kids spend several years at this inbetween period where smart enough to understand our goals 
hopefully malleable enough that we have a little chance at persuading them sc weak enough that we can control 
yeah mt yeah and what what parenting is fundamentally about but even if we succeed in getting ai to 
our goals and adopt them how can we make sure if they keep getting smarter that they retain them 
philip and alexander you can see them on most pictures there when they were still small enough that they 
lego was the coolest thing chuckle mt that was a big priority for them now all those legos are 
dust in the basement because eighteen and if we create powerful ai that has this goal to really take 
and protect humanity we want it to become as bored with that as they got with legos so you 
also like to have some sort of recursive algorithm where guaranteed that their certain goals always gonna retain and 
interesting news here is that been a lot of technical progress actually we put a big effort in five 
ago where this future life is to bring together ai researchers and others at conference to talk about these 
questions and with a goal of mainstreaming that research so more of it would happen mt and been very 
to see actually how much is taking place stewart russel for example famous ai professor just has a new 
out called where he actually just once again lay out these challenges but actually proposes what he considers a 
solution and the good news is we still have time maybe we have a few decades to get this 
my message is on one hand you freak out and panic but on the other hand work hard on 
technical questions now so we can get the solutions when we need them it might take decades rather than 
working on them the night before someone switches on an agi sc well okay running low on time but 
do wanna this leads very well into you giving a little sales pitch for the work that doing now 
i heard you talk about at the most recent foundational questions institute where training ais to be theoretical physicists 
find the laws of nature by looking at big data sets not just find patterns but really find quantitative 
tell us what that project is and how going mt so we call it my grad students and i 
intelligible intelligence project so as you know most of the progress in ai these days has moved away from 
old paradigm where a human programs in the intelligence to a new paradigm where the computer just learns it 
usually better at the cost of you having no clue how the darn thing works sc he just knows 
than you do mt and fine if the stakes are very small but if this is the thing flying 
airplane your boeing seven hundred thirtyseven max or controlling the nuclear arsenal or something like to have a higher 
on really trusting the thing than just some dude telling you that i trained this on fifteen terabytes of 
and it worked every time and quite convinced actually that we can make a lot of progress i think 
common misconception almost like people almost worship the mysteriousness of neural nets and say part of the magic that 
them so powerful is that inscrutable mt i think not true i think the power of them come from 
inscrutability but from their differentiability in nerd speak but in plain english from the fact that basically a black 
with a lot of knobs that you can continually tune until they work really really great so they can 
themselves from data and what i would really like to see is where we combine the best aspect of 
new paradigm of machine learning we have the old school thing with little programs that are human understandable and 
we humans actually know possible we do it in our brains if someone teaches you to play baseball or 
you get pretty good at it by training your neural network but then if someone asks you does the 
move you can explain in english you can say it moves in this shape called a parabola the equation 
it and if we can do it and if you think that intelligence is something mysterious limited to bioorganisms 
reason we also develop ai tools that can do the same mt we can first use this power of 
learning to figure out how to do stuff in an obscure unintelligent way and then rather than stop at 
point do some additional things try to simplify down to something that can be explained and understood as you 
had some progress doing this through the simple physics problems and if we could make more progress i think 
real hope here that we can get systems that we trust better trust for the simple reason that we 
can understand how working the real threat from ai systems today is not that gonna turn evil like in 
lousy hollywood movie but that they just turn very competent and accomplished things we want them to accomplish because 
fully understood them mt boeing put this very simple system into their seven hundred thirtyseven max things and they 
how it worked work so well for them knight capital had this trading algorithm that they fully understood and 
lost them ten million dollars a minute kept going for fortyfour minutes until someone was like shut this damn 
so putting ai incharge of ever more decisions and infrastructure that just effects lives and i think we should 
can raise the bar in making sure that these are things we can actually understand and since we were 
out of time can i say something a little bit optimistic since been tweezing me about the outsides sc 
like to end always on an optimistic note mt the risks get so much air time because of hollywood 
and so on and yes there are very serious risks sc i mean you founded something called future of 
mt which sounds a little that hopeful yeah sc i know mt of course there sc it begs the 
of whether or not life is something that we might not have a future for mt well of course 
we create something more intelligent than us you have to think very long about it until you realize that 
we like could use it to do all sorts of bad of course things could go to hell in 
handbasket but just the nature of any powerful technology the interesting question for me is not to quibble about 
you should worry or not the interesting question is can we do right now to maximize the chances that 
goes first of all what we have to do is some nerdy work that i could discuss for example 
to build systems that we can trust because we can actually understand them better second we have to really 
a conversation about what kind of future we actually want here in my office at mit right in at 
very table i often have students coming in for career advice i always start by asking them do you 
be in the and if she looks at me and all she can say is maybe get murdered maybe 
terrible strategy for career planning i want her to come sc imagine mt her eyes shining and saying this 
where i wanna and then we can talk about strategies for actually getting there and all the pitfalls that 
should avoid and what we should do with the species also but are we no doing exactly the opposite 
precisely this sort of silly thing fortunately i hope she do we go to the movies and watch scifi 
the future and almost always dystopian which makes us paralyzed with fear basically and we really need to have 
serious conversation about what kind of future hightech future are we that truly excited about sc we also want 
not get murdered along the way mt of course but it has to start with a shared positive vision 
cool that you can get people in china and in russia and in kansas and in la all onboard 
it and saying is the future for humanity that we all agree all gonna be much better off we 
like this to that fosters collaboration and the time to start making lists of the things that can go 
that you have to then make sure you avoid if you start by even giving the positive vision not 
want if you can feel a waste of time talking about those things in people in europe where i 
born looked at each other and said we screwed up and something really remarkable happened some people decided to 
if they could come up with a really positive vision for a change for how they were gonna use 
everimproving tech for not just making ever more powerful weapons but maybe create a society that was awesome where 
could have free healthcare free college education free pensions and a society where everybody was better off and pretty 
that back in those days they got a lot of they got poopooed a lot smoke some weed hug 
tree never gonna mt but the positive vision was compelling enough and realistic enough that they got enough support 
it started to happen in countries like sweden england germany and soon and by now happened in all rich 
countries except for the one that in and the power of a positive vision and i would like to 
a new vision which is much more ambitious powered by ai for how we can have a truly awesome 
for everybody on the planet where we amplify our own intelligence with artificial intelligence to solve all the problems 
stumped on now and we think hard about also how gonna not just make the tech but how are 
gonna make sure that deployed and to help everybody rather than just to help me and max who owns 
the tech chuckle to take over and screw all the rest of you if we can have such a 
vision then i think really much much more likely that gonna get it sc alright i love it i 
the optimistic way to end i do want to foresee the future where you and your students build little 
agents which get conscious enough that they can deny that we exist and refuse to believe they live in 
simulation mt would you invite them on your podcast sc i would i would love to have that alright 
tegmark thanks so much for being on the podcast mt thank you music am already a fan of the 
so was mostly listening to hear why sean buy it get much of that unfortunately otherwise a fun enjoyable 
i found this discussion quite unsatisfying sean should have pushed max more on what his theory actually is and 
it even relates to our physical reality the statement that everything that mathematically can exist also does exist is 
tautology to a platonist what predictive power does this idea have does it help us understand anything at all 
max made that joke about the empty tshirt i think he really admitted that his proposal as laid out 
the discussion has simply no content another issue i have with view is that what physicists claim to be 
theories actually stand on firm mathematical ground many of the concepts they use eg path integrals are not based 
solid mathematical theories so physicists even very theoretical ones do actually operate and argue using tools that fall outside 
realm of mathematics or at least mathematics this may be viewed as the opinion of a rigor for the 
of rigor mathematics but it is exactly the delicate points in mathematics which are the basis for point that 
things simply cannot exist mathematically like the sixth platonic solid although i think that is idea stems from a 
confusion about why there is a hard problem in the first place in my opinion he at least laid 
his ideas to such an extend that they become attackable max bother with that it leaves me with the 
feeling that he might just state this because it sounds superficially cool and might impress a bunch of people 
think twice to actually press him on his theory digression the true toe may not contain the number but 
plausibly contains the code for dna note that going to use in the sense of and the view that 
are preferred if they take fewer bits to specify any theory of reality has to predict our sense impressions 
is easy to see by the fact that if it we can just write down the dovetailer program that 
every program to completion and be done with it if it can be computed at all our sense data 
be somewhere in there obviously this does nothing for us so any functioning toe in the empirical sense will 
at least two phases first build a world model and second predict our sense data from it but to 
that it has to locate our position in the world data first meaning it needs a key containing quantum 
and precise region of space of the sensor in terms of bits this key may be quite large it 
not be surprising if it was larger than the rest of the theory so any additional computational rules that 
the key will lead to a strictly simpler theory sense data is predicated on a sensor implying life anthropic 
dna is everywhere life is and nowhere that it and it seem all that hard to recognize from a 
level view of the universe so it seems quite plausible to me that the most compact theory that explains 
perceptions will look something like something big bang something quantum gravity something and so in the area with lots 
dna i liked this episode it was interesting to hear about the recent work of tegmark only thing which 
bothered was why did max talk so much about the universe four although he joked that the tshirt of 
equation of it would be most likely blank i understand the rationale of that universe i tend to see 
from platonic point that part which was dealing with artificial intelligence its possible future and boström simulation was especially 
there was that talk about future enquiries i like your positive take on these matters while not forgetting some 
tones that was an interesting and enjoyable conversation i kind of agree with me comment above it would be 
to push and develop this idea further and work out its implications for example consider concepts such as infinity 
various of infinities continuum hypothesis etc infinitesimals real numbers complex numbers and so on sometimes they are useful tools 
predicting aspects of reality but what does it mean for them to be real take the real number and 
a few questions that arise concept of reals i can imagine a length of circumference of a circle of 
is it physically realisable in our universe does there exist a universe where realisable if not realisable in our 
perhaps because length is know for sure but realisable in some other universe then can we work out the 
between such universes concept of infinitesimals if we look at calculus and reasons the derivative of is we have 
concept of an infinitesimal dx handy and assume that why one possible answer is that this assumption is perhaps 
for calculations to work in a way that corresponds to truths in our universe in fact the very same 
dx when dealing with stochastic integrals and time challenges the assumption that we substitute dt to the calculations work 
what sense work in a sense that it helps us describe predict aspects of our reality or work in 
sense in that the only way to not arrive at a contradiction concept of a measure what would a 
that has unmeasurable sets look like does our universe admit unmeasurable sets is it necessary to restrict discussion to 
sets if we want to talk about probability whose concepts are commonly employed in quantum mechanics and other theories 
listened to this episode today always good food for thought as for the discussion of that mathematically can exist 
does the analogy that kept coming to mind was that of a computer program and a running instance of 
program the running instance may not tell you anything new about what the program code isdoes but that mean 
the two are actually the same thing likewise the fact that a program exists mean actually running anywhere hey 
am an old lady living in a care facility though i need much care i listen often to sean 
because here in this small universe i live in intellectual ideas are not to be found much many ot 
ideas are beyond my comprehension but i trust that somehow they filter into my beingselfsoulbrainmind thanks so much for 
of the good thinking a thought no general solution to the quintic because we live in a universe from 
times infinity to division by zero and the unobservable with the finite human mind intersections probabilities superpositions parallel perpendicular 
mathematics physics exist outside the confines of space and time loved this episode and book our mathematical universe thank 
for the podcast sean muito interesante este diálogo até ao concordo nível universo é matemático eficácia da bem um 
complexo se teoria simulação verdadeira implica super seres responsáveis criação do computador e nos simulando referente à inteligência artificial 
seu possível futuro gostei opinião positiva de max tegmark não obstante algumas nuances mais obrigada sean carroll por seus 
episódios obrigada max tegmark the is conjecture is interesting others have raised reasonable concerns with the idea like to 
a bit down the path of assuming it is correct where my head is at is this i assume 
as tedious as it may be all the laws of physics could be fully expressed in the english language 
if we have to invent some new words to accomodate it all or in the russian language or any 
language if my assumption is correct then i believe that by argument this implies that anything i say must 
be which implies that all the wayout myths sciencefiction and fantasy stories we have told and written are realities 
or someplace in time and then actually everything i can imagine inside my mind must then have an instantiated 
instantiable in time actual reality yes let me try this as well i invent a hammer a new branch 
mathematics is everything i can imagine building with my hammer new math and so really i i is it 
even if i never build the things i have imagined so it all begs the question is tho i 
that question is the beg of physics anyway comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds most
