sean carroll back in the early there was an idea going around called the end of history the berlin 
had fallen the ussr was dissolving there was a feeling that history had been very interesting thousands of years 
conflict and war and trying out different forms of government and society but that now as the century came 
a close we had more or less figured it out the way to live is in a liberal democracy 
liberal democracy was gaining ascendance throughout the world even old dictatorships or authoritarian regimes were crumbling under the democratic 
as it turns out the idea of democracy is not necessarily a stable one you can have a democratic 
that gets rid of its democratic institutions for one reason or another and a couple of centuries which is 
time period over which democracy has been ascendant in the western world is a short period historically right now 
a period where the world is changing rapidly in many ways and you just say everything is done politically 
it out all gonna be liberal democrats going forward sc indeed as many of you might have noticed just 
the past couple years there has been increasing antidemocratic sentiment around the world it can be very blatant in 
places some countries have elected through democratic means quite explicitly antidemocratic leaders here in the united states certainly been 
and arguments about whether or not our new trump administration is not getting in line with the norms of 
democracy attacking the media undercutting our confidence in our electoral processes and so forth around the world strong men 
autocratic forces are ascendant and you can have different opinions about this you can think that this is a 
problem and if you do think a real problem then i think that something that is not just alarmism 
think that if you are of the opinion that this is happening and this is bad more than enough 
that we should really take this seriously you might on the other hand think that this is just liberals 
that they lost the election not used to having a strong leader they have to fight against and if 
okay but up to you to articulate exactly why okay to attack the media in certain ways what should 
the norms that are always respected no matter who is the boss no matter which party is in power 
is not an easy thing to do sc so important that we think about these things and guest is 
mounk who is one of the most interesting and articulate people who is thinking seriously and carefully about these 
right now dr mounk is a lecturer on government at harvard university he is also a senior fellow in 
political reform program at new america and also the executive director at the tony blair institute for global change 
his spare time apparently he writes a weekly column at slate online and he also hosts a podcast of 
own over there called the good fight his most recent book is people versus democracy why our freedom is 
danger and how to save i strongly recommend reading this book an eye opener it can be depressing if 
take it seriously and if you take it seriously if you disagree with it then as i said important 
explicitly say in as reasonable calm and persuasive a way as you can why we be worried about these 
one way or another this is something we all have to be thinking about so go music sc yascha 
welcome to the mindscape podcast yascha mounk my pleasure sc so start with a little preamble here because admit 
the one hand very excited to have you on the podcast both loved your work on twitter and in 
places since i discovered it and also because you are a fellow podcaster the first guest had who is 
expert on being on both sides of this microphone ym and a great professional and gonna judge you on 
transgression sc well i know that yes what looking forward to i want the report card after all said 
done but also trepidation because politics and even if political science and intellectual scholarship and so forth there is 
nittygritty ugly tribalism of politics and what trying to get around in this podcast is exactly that trying to 
for the underlying ideas the big picture so there is a big picture we all know here in the 
states certain political things going on but not just a random particular event there are some trends underlying going 
here in the us and going on more broadly right the world is seeing at least it seems from 
news an upsurge in a kind of populist nativist nationalist isolationist authoritarian moment so just to start out why 
that over the next hour be digging into some of the underlying reasons why happening but your take right 
on sort of the state of the world when it comes to this kind of movement going on ym 
pretty worried about going on in the world i was just writing an article where i started outlining how 
some countries in the world looked three years ago three years ago the huffington post had just announced to 
hilarity that it would cover the presidential campaign by one donald j trump in the entertainment section laughter ym 
britain you had not somebody i personally would have voted for but a very reasonable moderate centerright prime minister 
david cameron the idea of brexit was being pursued by the uk independence party and a few hardliners in 
tory party but it really seemed very unlikely there was leadership election of the labour party which seemed to 
go to a relatively sensible person in germany angela merkel was at the height of her popularity and there 
farright populist party in the parliament now today you are seeing not just authoritarian populists in power in the 
states with donald trump in places like the philippines with rodrigo duterte in poland and hungary and italy and 
whole bunch of other places even in the countries that are supposedly working relatively well in the countries where 
populists have not yet taken over you have seen these radical transformations of political systems ym so today in 
the alternative for germany which is quite extreme is in the bundestag and according to some polls it is 
the second biggest party in the country larger than the social democrats in great britain you now have a 
of the labour party who bears more resemblance to jill stein than he does to bernie sanders you have 
prime minister who is embattled from the far right of her own party may lose her job any moment 
and had two years of the establishment trying to figure out what on earth to do about the vote 
brexit and not really making any progress in figuring out what the plan for the country is so just 
a snapshot of some of the changes in the world i would say it look too good sc and 
recently the picture you paint is one of rapid change which might even be extra worrying right ym yeah 
so it comes on the heels of a long development when you look at the rise of populist parties 
movements it started in at least the year even earlier than that and has been rising since so some 
years ago the average vote share of a populist party in continental europe for example was about now it 
more like or a very rapid increase we see them now being in power in a whole set of 
you can drive from north to south of europe without ever leaving a country ruled by populists that certainly 
ten or fifteen years ago and has become particularly fast in the last few years in part because the 
are now at levels of strength where they can suddenly form the government as a physicist you think about 
kinds of things all the time i imagine which is to say you have systems that seem relatively stable 
you start seeing a certain kind of change in them but it seem to worry and people notice it 
much because the system on the whole is still stable and then eventually as it comes close to a 
kind of threshold you see that a small increase has much bigger systemic effects and i think the kind 
moment now in with populism sc yeah exactly right the idea of a phase transition where things can be 
or less on appearances fairly stable over long periods of time then suddenly something happens my wife jennifer ouellette 
is a science writer is actually working on a book on this very topic exploring the fact that while 
can seem to not be changing to our most direct observations things can be changing underneath the surface that 
lead up to these apparently radical quick transformations and they can be good public opinion switched about gay marriage 
in the united states very quickly but secretly it was changing all along and it can be for the 
just as well ym well i hope she is gonna add a topic about the cheery topic of populism 
oh yeah well a good point because i wanna dig in a little bit deeper here what is a 
of populism when i was a kid and i heard the word it made no sense to me like 
means popular and if in a democracy you should be popular to be elected but of course it means 
a little bit different than that ym yeah and i think that is a real problem with that word 
many public appearances where i try to define populism i try to explain to people what i mean by 
what the proper scientific definition of it is people then in the question session say wrong with not populism 
popularism politicians try to be and of course they should a normal part of politics for politicians to say 
are unhappy with the current crop of politicians and gonna point out the ways in which they are imperfect 
mistaken and gonna try and rile up a little bit of emotion against them and say standing for all 
those popular things that they actually thought so that is perfectly normal ym different about populism is the claim 
the only real reason why we have problems today is that the existing political elite is corrupt or selfserving 
claim that they alone truly stand for the people that while they are the voice of the people everybody 
disagrees with them is by nature of that illegitimate because if i stand for people and someone disagrees with 
well then they are against the people and then it often goes together with very large extreme promises so 
once the populists are in power and they live up to those promises as our president sometimes likes to 
knew that things could be so complicated who knew that health care could be so i think if he 
a student in one of your classes sean he might upon seeing the f on his midterm say knew 
physics could be so sc yeah ym but they want to actually admit that they told lies and made 
outside promises say i been able to deliver for you because the opposition are traitors and they are undermining 
because the free press are fake news and they need to be regulated because the independent institutions like judges 
the fbi are all biased against me and they now need to have their independence taken why populism is 
sc right and so getting the impression that in some sense populism is defined in opposition to this group 
elites and maybe an illdefined group but the populace versus these people who have the power and deserve it 
need to be brought under control is that fair ym yeah right and you know again an element to 
that is normal in democracy but to say the people in power right now really serving interests and we 
to correct but it goes together for populists with a real lack of respect for the most basic rules 
norms of political discourse so the thing that was very shocking in the united states in two thousand sixteen 
a presidential candidate would leave in doubt whether he will accept the outcome of the election that he would 
just attack his opponent as having the wrong ideas or perhaps even not being as morally upright as he 
but is saying gonna lock her those things are very typical of populists that unwillingness to accept the kinds 
rules we need not because important in themselves or because we somehow have a weird attachment to norms but 
in order for democracy to work i need to not only be able to elect the guy i want 
i also need to be sure that gonna respect the rules and the constraints of his power enough so 
i have a chance of electing somebody else four years from now and in many countries that happen sc 
always thought that the real birth of a democracy is the first time that the party in power faces 
election and loses and hands it over right and so you can win an election great but we assume 
part of having norms and so forth and probably get into that but we assume that there are rules 
everyone agrees to play by and certainly in addition to attacking the media attacking the legitimacy of elections is 
common these days ym yeah no exactly right the real test of a democracy is whether politicians are willing 
cede power when they lose and in many cases we yet seen the test for a populist in part 
this is another test they have skewed the playing field so much that the opposition have a real chance 
winning so what seeing increasingly is that you have political systems in which somebody says a dictator now never 
be an election countries like russia even countries like valenzuela have elections sc yeah ym but they are elections 
which some of the most promising candidates of the opposition allowed to run in which they might even be 
in jail in which if you go to a protest or a rally for the opposition candidate you might 
beaten up by the police or you might be locked away all of the main television channels are under 
of the regime or of close allies of it you have changes to the electoral system that are meant 
favor the governing party and you take all of those things together and you basically have managed elections in 
people can go out to vote but the opposition have a fair shot of it and so what seeing 
places like hungary is that the countries are rapidly moving towards such a system and even if despite all 
those obstacles the opposition should somehow win i have real questions in my mind about whether a viktor orbán 
example would voluntarily step down from power sc well always in physics terms as we were talking about before 
been an instability in the very idea of democracy if a dictatorship and you just keep the squeeze of 
carefully enough you can go on forever in a democracy always the worry that the people will democratically elect 
rulers and an instability if everyone chooses to be nondemocratic then democracy survive sort of the political science equivalent 
karl question about tolerance tolerating the intolerant can be a bad thing so these societies that are democratic base 
success on the idea that people buy in to the idea of being democratic which is not just voting 
the person you want but giving up power when you want it are we seeing the people in these 
become less willing to give up power when they lose ym right or to the people i think are 
willing and tempted to vote for politicians who give good signs of not respecting the limits on their power 
is one of the reasons why the title of my book is people versus it captures that otherwise paradoxical 
that people vote for a candidate who says you know what just trust me leave me all the power 
are gonna work out by the way that sound you may hear in the background i believe is donald 
flying into london overhead so it to me fix it just give me a little bit more power trust 
sc right ym but then they start to use that power precisely in order to make it impossible to 
a democratically elected president or prime minister by democratic means by the way if you want to hear about 
ideas of the flaws of democracy i have a good story for you sc oh yes please tell me 
good science story ym so i will not remember the details here and i may butcher and even embellish 
little bit in the process but there was a great story i came across about a year ago of 
godel the great logician wanting to take a citizenship exam so he had come to the united states fleeing 
nazis he was looking to come to princeton one of his best buddies was albert einstein who was also 
at the same time he was becoming eligible for citizenship and he had to take the citizenship test he 
to einstein who had already gone through the process and said should i do to study for this and 
said look they send you a leaflet just read through the leaflet be but godel was not one to 
this kind of thing without the requisite seriousness sc logicians trouble yeah ym exactly he started to really study 
very deeply on the constitution and the separation of powers and how it all works and on the day 
the exam einstein decided to go to the test with godel as moral support for he seems to have 
a little bit of a jackass because on the road trip over he started asking are you sure that 
really have prepared well enough for this and so on so godel comes in a little bit of a 
of nerves and recognizing einstein they ushered both of them into an office and einstein is allowed to sit 
as the test is administered the official sort of makes a little bit of small talk with godel and 
i see you come from austria horrible been happening and godel says terrible happening in my country is and 
thankfully now in the united states something like that could never happen and godel starts saying actually i have 
studying the constitution and there is a deep and einstein kicks him under the table and says and he 
answers a couple of questions sc yeah being completely truthful is not always the best strategy in these situations 
wonder if godel was in fact just thinking of the fact that you could that the constitution allows itself 
be changed you can change it to be anything you want and so which brings us to another thing 
your book ym and i would go further than that which is not just that the constitution can be 
which by the way is very difficult in the united states but that ultimately people have to stand up 
it that if you have a president who does not respect the rightful limits of his authority and he 
a political party which also happens to have a majority in congress and which also happens to have judges 
the supreme court whose loyalty to a particular ideological movement goes more deeply than their loyalty to constitutional values 
values of their institution then they can in practice get away with all kinds of things that might in 
not be allowed and that is ultimately what the danger has always been that political forces takes over a 
and they simply do things that on a fair reading of a local constitution they be allowed to do 
because there are the people who are actually in the offices of institutions that are meant to stop them 
their job have a higher loyalty to a party or a man than the constitution they get away with 
it themselves so perhaps what godel was thinking sadly the record of the story does not explain what godel 
thought the flaw was so we have to guess sc so there could be all sorts of flaws that 
even see but yeah ym it may be a flaw that the only godel was brilliant enough to see 
exactly laughter putting your finger on the role of buyin to the democratic process to the norms that we 
one of the big things that has been highlighted in the recent years since trump has been elected is 
extent to which we do rely on people behaving well not simply following the law as it is written 
following the spirit of the law in some sense as well so is this another new thing or is 
just something that they were less artful about taking advantage of before it seems to me that in the 
there was less political polarization at least here in the us and there was more belief in the standards 
you should do the right thing even if it benefit your party been recently rewatching the west wing and 
episode where a republican committee chairman stops one of the people on his committee from questioning a democratic witness 
it on the topic that they were supposed to be investigating even though it would have been devastating to 
democratic party for them to do that and sitting there thinking just no way that that would happen right 
if you can take the advantage you would just win so it does seem like something has really changed 
well lots of things that happen in west wing that never happen in real life one of which is 
people always have the perfect retort the world that everybody had two hours to think of a next move 
no i think there is a real transformation there which is caused by a whole set of things one 
them is rising polarization the public as a whole in the united states is not necessarily more extreme in 
political views or more polarized now than they were twenty or forty or sixty years ago although the political 
are so the most moderate democrat used to be far more conservative than the most moderate republican that is 
longer the case there is a real gulf between them and we also see by the way many people 
having less of an understanding of the constitution i think for a long time there was a very deep 
to the idea of having to transmit political values from one generation to the next the idea of the 
fathers of how important it is to have a constitutional culture and i think because we started to take 
democracy for granted we slightly took civic education for granted and we know from various studies that people know 
much less now about the most basic aspects of a constitution the kinds of things you need to pass 
citizenship test how many supreme court justices are there and so on than they did a few decades ago 
i also think that there is a strange element of a use for fiction having been exposed i mean 
two or three years ago when you go back through what some of the most intelligent commentators were writing 
i agree with them at the time but there were some of the smartest people writing about this making 
arguments they said look somebody like donald trump a ceiling of how much support somebody can get like that 
get people have this deep commitment to the constitution to these norms if somebody says these kinds of outrageous 
or tells these kinds of lies most people are just gonna be so turned off by them that gonna 
away from it and now seeing not the case and that encourages more and more people to act in 
same way because apparently all of those things that we thought we would be deeply punished for not punished 
like you have an electric fence that bars your road to the supermarket and you always sort of walk 
it and one day by mistake you touch it and you realize you know what actually i get a 
from it this time so perhaps try again and once done that seven or eight times no longer a 
in your mind to touching the electric fence because perhaps there was never a cost to it but now 
know sc yeah one of the great things in your book is that you closely analyzed the phrase i 
a lot of people will just sort of blurt that out as if one thing but there are two 
there liberal and democracy and you point out that they mean different things and both under attack in different 
although ways that might come together in some ways so why you help us understand that ym sure the 
thing to say is that just as populism popularism which seems obvious but is important liberal democracy is not 
opposite of conservative democracy a philosophical term in the sense in which i use barack obama was as much 
a liberal as george w bush or ronald reagan or bill clinton they all had a basic commitment to 
values so we use this term liberal democracy and we often think about what it means and how it 
that those two elements the liberal element and the democratic element may actually be in tension with each other 
the way that i understand it our political system has these two fundamental goals the first is to allow 
liberty the liberal element liberty sc classical liberalism ym yeah well classical liberalism has certain connotations about economic policy 
example which necessarily entailed here but it is a set of freedoms that individuals enjoy so that means that 
can say what i want i can worship as i want or not worship i can be in whatever 
i want to be or not be in a relationship and nobody gets to tell me that and in 
to sustain that i need both things like freedom of speech and we need to have a separation of 
because if the president dislikes what i say he be capable of just throwing me in prison we need 
institutions to do prosecution so that offending somebody with political power be dangerous to you so the first element 
the second element is relatively straight forward especially once separated the liberal element out a democratic element that well 
actually need to be able to translate popular views into public policies democracy is the rule of the demos 
of the people so actually what happens politically needs to be dependent on what we as individuals want rather 
being determined by a king or a dictator or a priest or an imam or a general ym my 
is that these two constitutive elements of our political system are coming apart more and more that for a 
time had political systems that have been reasonably good with some obvious shortcomings about respecting and protecting individual rights 
they done a terribly good job of actually being responsive to popular opinion and now what getting is a 
system in which yes at least at first some popular views are being translated into public policy but it 
at the price of individual rights of the rights of minorities and increasingly are the kinds of separation of 
that we need to sustain in order for the system to be stable over time sc well this brings 
so two directions to go here go in both of them but first in some sense suggesting that there 
countries or super country kind of organizations like the european union that are in fact antidemocratic that they are 
things behind the scenes even in the united states where we still have elections so much of everyday governmental 
that is done by executive departments people who are not elected but have enormous power over lives and there 
a legitimate complaint that people have that their views are not being put into public policy this whole invisible 
that is making things happen and so in some sense a fair critique of the current system is that 
ym yeah i think i go so far as to say that antidemocratic which sort of implies a conspiracy 
the people or conspiracy against democracy i think a little less exciting than that and so i would say 
which sounds similar but it is different in an important respect that often a response to quite real requirements 
our economy has become much more complex the needs of public policy have become more complicated in part because 
need much more international cooperation because harder to govern the economy and so what seen over the last fifty 
sixty years in virtually every country is the rise of a set of institutions that do constrain popular will 
complicated ways so on the one hand we just have parliaments congress of the united states not being responsive 
to what people want because of a rising role of money in politics the revolving door between lobbyists and 
and all those kinds of things and on the other hand we have a bit of a rise of 
agencies like the environmental protection agency or consumer protection bureau we have a central bank both much more powerful 
in certain ways more independent than it used to be we have a huge expansion of judicial review and 
growing importance and polarization of the supreme court we have international trade treaties lots of international agencies to deal 
all kinds of issues ym and these things a conspiracy against the people they are often responding to the 
for example that really hard to figure out how to keep a power plant safe and that you need 
of experts to make that decision and having congress vote on it day in and day out probably make 
lot of sense so why we create an agency that can pass a lot of those nuts and bolts 
and congress has the authority to abolish that agency but probably not going to but a real logic behind 
but cumulatively it does raise the danger that people look at going on and say know what for most 
this stuff never consulted i even understand what it really all means congress certainly making those decisions so how 
this really a sc yeah i think this i think dawning on me during this conversation i think a 
very important point that even putting aside all the questions about nativism and racism and immigration and so forth 
is a thing that is going on that is purely based on the fact that the world is becoming 
complicated and more interconnected technology is advancing we see this in purely technological realms where there are computer programs 
do really really important functions in the world that nobody understands no one person knows going on inside that 
program and the same thing is true about government nobody understands everything going on and maybe you could imagine 
nightmare scenario where two things happened simultaneously one is that people become frustrated that their needs are not being 
that not getting ahead they see the government as big and invisible and elitist and unresponsive and they vote 
into power as a response to that and at the same time all this complication gives more ways for 
people who are really up in the game people who are powerful and wealthy and connected to take advantage 
it and to increase their own wealth so we see this combination of populism and growing inequality and when 
say that out loud a plausible picture of what faced with right now ym yeah absolutely and this particular 
of it i have to say is the one that i find the most difficult to get my head 
because the other stuff is really worrying and scary but i know in theory at least what to do 
response so the fact that money plays far too big a role in our politics look terrible and given 
the supreme court is likely to be dominated by people who see that as a problem for the foreseeable 
it is in practice hard to know how to fight it but in theory i sort of know what 
do we need a much more robust campaign finance regulations make it harder for people to go from congress 
wall street and so on and so forth so i sort of know what the solutions are even though 
struggle to imagine a path by which we would implement on this other end it is harder because i 
do think the two values are in conflict with each other here and one of those values is responding 
popular will and having a sense that real democratic accountability and the other is actually achieving the expertise and 
coordination we need in order to solve very real problems that people are gonna be pissed off if we 
ym so take the topic of climate change in order to deal with climate change adequately we need to 
nearly two hundred countries around the world coordinating if united states does a lot of effort to reduce its 
emissions but russia and china at all just not gonna be able to deal with the problem but how 
earth are we going to structure a decision making process in which we coordinate the actions of two hundred 
and yet ordinary citizens feel like you know what i already had a say in going to be incredibly 
sc yeah and the time scale for human beings to care about what happens in the world is not 
longer than a human generation or a human lifetime so gonna be a very difficult problem in the best 
times but then we also have in addition to technology and globalization and connectivity and complexity we also do 
the questions of diversity and immigration and so forth and clearly these play a role in the aftermath of 
there was a debate is are people voting for him because of economic anxiety or because of racism or 
and clearly they both play some kind of role but you had a line in your book which i 
was very provocative you say in north america nor in western europe has there ever been a truly equal 
democracy so what trying to create right now is a historically unique is it plausible even if slightly depressing 
think that one of the reasons why democracy has been relatively successful over the past couple of centuries is 
been kind of a very special kind of democracy where there was always one group that was in charge 
therefore feel threatened and the attempt to really be democratic not only among people but among different kinds of 
in different groups is much less stable and harder to maintain ym a fear i mean one of the 
things about our political history well well before the prime of a democratic age is that those states that 
reasonably democratic tended to be more homogeneous that when you think of examples of a thriving multiethnic state or 
before say you might think of vienna in the century or you might think of istanbul or baghdad at 
points in the middle ages you might think of rome in the or century but those were one these 
either democratic or at least where minorities really have voting rights and in a way obvious when you think 
it because easier for me to tolerate somebody who might have a slightly different culture from me a different 
who perhaps has different ethnic origin if i feel like they have a voice over my political fate i 
any power he have any power all the decisions are made by the monarch anyway so once i look 
people who are quite different from me and say these people actually can go and vote and affect what 
to it becomes harder ym so one historical worry that i have and when you see how deep resentment 
especially and increasingly been social science on this of people who used to be dominant and are now threatening 
dominance and in europe the idea of what it was to be italian or french or german was always 
deeply monoethnic and monocultural it was somebody who was descended from a particular ethnic stock and so suddenly these 
are asked to say hey you know what somebody who comes from other parts of the world even if 
here but their parents did they can be a member of our society and thus feel resistance against that 
the states and in canada always been a multiethnic society but been one as you point out with a 
deep racial and religious hierarchy in which members of a particular group had big advantages over others ym and 
again the people who are having some of those unearned privileges taken away are going to be quite resentful 
that now i condone that i know i have a right to those privileges but i think actually important 
take a moment to try and understand where that sentiment comes from and i always picture somebody not perhaps 
talented not especially goodlooking not especially and in italy in they might have said know what i may not 
the most social respect and all of that but at least italian rather than albanian and at least part 
the majority population rather than one of those moroccan well now suddenly the kid of those albanian immigrants might 
making more money than you he might be your boss he might be representing you in parliament and i 
that as political progress but it too surprising that people who have that status advantage taken away from them 
can no longer say thus by virtue of being a member of this group i have a certain kind 
social status then gonna be resentful for having that taken away from them sc there was a sociologist who 
a study that i read back a couple of years ago have to look her up i forget her 
but it was one of these things she was ahead of the curve in terms of asking the question 
the trump voters really and she embedded herself she was a berkeley leftist progressive so she went to ym 
think thinking of arlie hochschild sc oh probably yes exactly and just talked to people and sort of lived 
lives and got to know where they were and she came up with this metaphor and she then read 
metaphor back to them and they said exactly and the metaphor was think of yourself as standing in line 
the race to life and better times ahead and walking toward them slowly and doing your work and effort 
making progress and then you see off to the side a whole bunch of new people skipping the line 
being elevated in front of you not waiting their turn and this feels unfair to you and these are 
or minorities or gays or lesbians or whatever or even women for that and people said yes more or 
how they feel even if not really an accurate representation so i want to give value to that feeling 
can we give people back the feeling that they are in charge of their destiny this must have at 
some role to be played by inequality and the fact that more and more wealth is going to the 
but still on a broader scale we need to be able to make people think that this is their 
they can get ahead their country as well as other countries and a good thing rather than a bad 
not quite sure how to get there in any simple way ym yeah and here again the striking thing 
that never quite done that so we should be prepared for some pain but what describing is exactly right 
need to figure out how we can defend minority groups against frankly required obvious attacks that suffering at the 
and more broadly the disadvantages that they have suffered for a longer time and at the same time we 
to make sure that the majority group assured of having special privileges i think we can justly ensure that 
that they feel like they are still going to get to the front of the line at some point 
well that the goals that they have and the inspiration that they have are going to be fulfilled and 
they see those as being threatened by those broader cultural and demographic changes and doing both of those things 
the same time is incredibly hard but our ability to win the kind of society we want is dependant 
that ym and i wanna add something here which is important which is that i think sometimes i hear 
lot of impatience with that question from people who perhaps are members of minority groups or just more broadly 
the left and i get that because here we are already suffering from historical discrimination being attacked right now 
supposed to worry about the feelings of those people who have it better than us anyway i absolutely get 
reaction but i do think that a slight contradiction in how we sometimes think about that which is that 
hear the same people say live in a society in which racism and white supremacy and structural injustice goes 
deep and the majority group has these incredible reserves of power and influence and so on and at the 
time we should not give an inch to them we should be absolutely and not quite sure how we 
those two things if you really think that the majority group has such deep power and influence then in 
to affect any kind of change you need to make your case to them to some extent right sc 
you need allies ym because if then if you have at least some of them onboard then just gonna 
every time and so i think that the most helpful way of doing this is to actually appeal to 
better instincts of perhaps not every single member of a majority group but part of the majority group and 
is by the way what the civil rights movement did in many ways what barack obama did and it 
be effective and sure frustrating sure it sometimes means that we be quite as blunt at least in certain 
of politics as we would like to be not to vent our justified anger quite as freely as we 
like but if you actually care about making this country better and winning those political victories i feel that 
to some extent sc yeah and i feel easy for me to give advice to people who are members 
historically discriminated against groups since almost none of the groups that in have faced that but i also think 
to distinguish between groups and individuals and i think the fact that there is white privilege and male privilege 
cisgender privilege etcetera i think these are very real things those mean that even if a member of all 
groups your life was easy or you struggled and i think that there are real struggles that people go 
no matter what groups members of in some sense everyone struggles but there are some poor people or people 
economics and politics have left behind in a very real way and nothing wrong with taking their concerns seriously 
of crucially important to the bigger democratic project ym well and right and i think a real problem with 
here which is to say that obviously on average members of historically discriminated groups by virtue of being members 
historically discriminated groups have faced many more obstacles and many more struggles than members from majority groups and that 
a deep injustice that as a society we need to reconcile but obviously the kinds of people who end 
being the spokespeople for that position also the spokespeople by coincidence the spokespeople because they have had more success 
life and perhaps also had some advantages relative to other members of their own group ym and so you 
end up with a dynamic in which people who actually personally have also experienced real discrimination and so on 
have gone to some of the best colleges in the country make six figure salaries and so on sort 
sit there explaining why it is that perhaps all members of a dominant group have these huge privileges and 
end up with people who had a great education who perhaps have had real personal tragedies happening to them 
perhaps have had abusive parents or come from households that are deeply dysfunctional sort of listening to this and 
you professor so and so or fellow at so and so instituiton or columnist at so and so newspaper 
magazine explain to me why is it that so and a real problem with the dynamic right which invalidate 
fact but of course there are those underlying structural injustices but i think it means that we need to 
a little sensitive of how to communicate that in a way that people are willing to have an open 
towards sc yeah and again i feel bad asking people who are members of groups who have been discriminated 
to be patient and understanding and empathetic to the people who are members of groups who have been dominating 
for hundreds of years but also a good strategy long term i think a place for bomb throwing and 
a ruckus also a place for sitting down and reasoning together and appreciating each points of view becoming less 
less common ym i just want to empathize two things a this is not a moral claim a strategic 
just a claim about what to do in order to ensure that people like donald trump in a position 
do tremendous damage and violence to those groups and b i think we would do well not to talk 
how much of a ruckus should you raise and how loud should you be about that i think to 
about the manner in which we talk about it not how much we talk about it or how passionately 
talk about it which is to say that at a moment in which minorities are under a very real 
no limit to how much we should talk about it i just think that the strategically productive way of 
about it is to actually say this is the kind of society we want and why that society is 
which would be appealing to all america and why despite the dark chapters in american history it actually calls 
the best traditions in american history and it calls on the ideals of the founding fathers even if the 
fathers themselves were in many ways flawed and something that martin luther king to barack obama a lot of 
in the history of our country have done incredibly successfully so that to me appears to be the way 
actually make headway sc yeah and gonna choose to continue to be optimistic on balance about the force of 
and community and appealing to the better angels of our nature however let me also say that i read 
book and very depressing laughter real prospect of things going badly i want to be an alarmist or i 
to overreact certainly in my mind very possible that despite everything donald trump and the united states and other 
in other countries will be moments in history not precursors of an entirely new phase of history but also 
possibility that things go just disastrously wrong if you asked what would it be like for a functioning healthy 
liberal democracy like the united states to turn into an authoritarian dictatorship maybe the precursors would look more or 
like what seeing so how seriously should we be worried about a true collapse of liberal democracy in a 
like the united states ym well i think a way of interpreting a question purely about probabilities and a 
of interpreting it about expected values which is to say that i think that the likelihood of liberal democracy 
in the united states is over probably quite a bit lower than but given how disastrous that outcome should 
i think we should be very worried about it sc ym i know hard to put a percentage around 
but the striking thing is that five or ten years ago political scientists thought that it was essentially impossible 
the likelihood was zero that once countries have this is your point from earlier have changed governments through free 
fair elections at least a couple of times once they had a gdp per capita of more than about 
thousand dollars in terms they were safe we have to worry about them and already seen in countries like 
where not true that you have authoritarian populists take over there and in my mind destroy liberal democracy for 
probably not even persevere illiberal democracy but erect a form of competitive totalitarianism and now seeing the president of 
united states take the first steps that people like putin in russia like erdoğan in turkey that hugo chavez 
venezuela have taken a few years ago and because a richer country a country with a more vibrant civil 
a very deep constitutional tradition every hope that gonna be able to stop that that at step three or 
four donald trump is not gonna be able perhaps not want to take step five and six and seven 
well but certainly as a scholar of comparative politics the pattern seeing the direction going in is very concerning 
sc yeah as a good bayesian i feel my responsibility intellectually to actually assign probabilities to everything that i 
might happen but i take your point which is that definitely undergone a change from thinking that that kind 
disaster in the united states is simply inconceivable for all practical purposes to at least thinking that conceivable and 
it is rare and it happen then a silver lining there that we take this more seriously and hopefully 
can fix things down the road the pessimism that i have about that is one of the many ways 
was wrong about politics over the last few years was i dramatically underestimated the extent to which serious grown 
members of the republican party would resist the worst impulses of a trumplike administration and i take it that 
happening in other countries you join a group you do game theory what is best for my reelection chances 
way more important than best for the larger country and even more depressing than the fact that one person 
another wins an election to me ym yeah so a few thoughts here the first is that as a 
scientist always been quite skeptical of some of my colleagues who took a rational choice approach to much of 
political world and in particular to this case right where we said look i mean basically you can just 
what maximizes a chance of reelection and then from that very simple assumption you can derive most of their 
and for that you know i quite buy that people are more complicated than that perhaps a bit more 
than that well i have become much more sympathetic to that approach over the last couple of years i 
to tell you ym the other thing is that i used to be the most pessimistic person in the 
i mean a sort of democracy doom hipster i worried about democracy before it was cool and i used 
be called a a lot of the time as a result and i always wanted to say to people 
was right damn it read the i it made me sound like much of a crank but i was 
pessimist in debates about what would happen to the republican party once donald trump won the presidency i the 
thought know what these people have very different beliefs from donald trump and they have deep commitment to constitutional 
and so just gonna rein him i thought not true the base is actually of trump at this point 
know a couple of them might flip and over time donald trump is going to succeed in replacing the 
with his own base gonna have candidates running the primary and be a sought of republican civil war for 
or six or eight years but eventually turn into a populist ym well it turns out speaking of having 
update your probabilities that both wrong that what happened is much more extreme than what i predicted and that 
just flipped they said know what trump is so popular this is clearly where at now even though for 
years i talked about values that are very very different just gonna go with this and so much more 
much more thoroughly than pessimists like me had predicted donald trump has wound up being in control of the 
party and as bayesians i think we should therefore also update our probability of similar shifts happening in our 
much more worried now than i was six or seven months ago about the supreme court acquiescing with extreme 
by donald trump sc yeah and the evidence is there so we collect more data we update our priors 
not not good news for optimism but still some remaining let me just play the advocate here part of 
pessimism that i have is that i know some pretty smart people in academia and elsewhere who are saying 
trump is not gonna win any iq tests but if we look worldwide if we look not just at 
but if we look at china or russia it possible that a sense in which a even a strong 
government gets more especially looking at china there are people who say sure not a democracy human rights are 
good but boy they can really build bridges really really well there a trade off there that we might 
about buying into what do you say to that argument ym well a few things first of all the 
systems that work very well actually very limited in number in china worked reasonably well economically for now a 
question about whether it can transition from being a midincome economy to a high income economy but very difficult 
emulate china i like to quip that china works very well in practice but a mess in theory it 
a very unique history that unless you happen to have a communist party kicking around been around for sixty 
and still sort of claims to be maoist but actually is state capitalist very difficult to know how you 
even go about emulating china so look at the countries which do actually resemble donald trump look at the 
in which authoritarian populists have taken over countries like venezuela countries like turkey and russia and hungary and not 
particularly well economically sc right ym deeply corrupt recep erdoğan just made his soninlaw the new finance minister sc 
would never happen here okay ym unimaginable do we even know who soninlaw is sc never heard of the 
yeah behind the scenes ym and this is by the way something when i talk to members of the 
community i have to emphasize to them i mean already seen companies like att pay essentially bribes to michael 
personal lawyer you have seen attacks on american companies for the business decisions they took like harleydavidson threatening tax 
and so on rule of law is one of the reasons why the american economy has worked incredibly well 
want a situation in which your success as a businessman depends on whether or not you are in favor 
the regime and not a natural thought that is how business runs in many countries in the world and 
countries tend to have much lower growth rates sc okay good this has been great to close i will 
the role of the genie coming out of the bottle and i will give you one wish but only 
give you a menu you get to make up your wish ym oh good that makes it easier sc 
exactly it is a multiple choice genie and so here are your choices with the goal in mind of 
combination of making the country more pluralistic and liberal democracy successful so one option is you could radically improve 
educational system secondary and primary you could really inculcate values you could teach kids that diversity is important and 
constitution is important and rule of law is important democracy and all that stuff one option another is you 
really impose policies that would help fight inequality redistribute some of the wealth not by necessarily socializing everything but 
a real tax code that took capital gains and wealth into account and really helped people maybe a basic 
or something like that that is the second option and the third option is we could make i know 
this would but we could make sure the media actually told the truth laughter we could have different voices 
the media but make sure that there is not any sort of quasi statesponsored propaganda machine that gave people 
news that they thought that they should be hearing so those are your three choices which one of those 
you think is the most important ym gonna be very annoying here sc ah ym and give sort of 
natural scientist perhaps even if i may be so bold answer and i think a lot of the things 
are different parts of an equilibrium and very hard to change one of those without changing the other so 
think if you had much more economic equality you also would have a much better education system sc right 
and if people were better educated then they would also be less likely to watch fox news and so 
think that these things go together or fall together sc also no such thing as genies so you could 
said that that would have been an adequate naturally scientific response ym rah damn i missed the easy opportunity 
would have been the easy way out laughter sc alright yascha thanks so much even if not always making 
more optimistic i think it is important to understand going on what really gives me optimism that there are 
like you that are really taking these things seriously looking at them as carefully and rationally as we can 
trying to find a good way forward ym and if allowed a closing word things that people can do 
mean the people who are listening to this podcast you if you have an answer to excellent question about 
a b or c then go and work at that if you think a go and work at improving 
education system if b then go and fight for more income equality if you think its c then go 
found your own media company do whatever it takes but i am worried about the future but not fatalistic 
i do think subject to human agency and unlike the citizens of china and north korea and turkey and 
we all still have the liberty to go and fight for our political values so what our job is 
sc good you correctly perceived the subtext of the question ym oh great sc alright yascha mounk thank you 
much for being on the podcast ym thank you this was great fun sc thanks music the trump phenomenon 
it is widely held with a groundswell of american opinion that representitive democracy is not authentically representing the american 
rather the reins of american socalled liberal democracy are in the hands of intellectualised elitists who represent themselves and 
own interests no doubt sincerely from their points of view trump just happened to be the guy there at 
time who said the things it could have been anyone saying the things populist opinion is not perforce negative 
bad it quite obviously is someting that needs to be accommodated in democracy before american democracy falls apart and 
creepycrawlies always in the woodwork crawl out to exploit the malaise the solution in my view is to get 
out of the system at least out of the driving seat too much is happening around everyone that has 
discernible public mandate it just happens anyway people need to see that things happening around them do have a 
mandate they should be able to ask around friends and acquaintances anyone ask and the answer at least sometimes 
yes some comments the discussion though interesting is somewhat too abstract and largely ahistorical the american democratic practice including 
has had marked periods of illiberalism intolerance of minorities ethnic cleansing racism crooked elections and punctual failures to abide 
constitutional order in foreign affairs been generally the practice to coerce near neighbors directly and less directly more serious 
competitors but the general historical trend has been that these distortions have been constrained over time some practices of 
past would not occur today even with trump i could cite examples but i think necessary the point is 
the institutions are robust and will not be easily dissuaded from applying any number of sanctions on trump or 
as needed the popular democratic will of the polity expresses itself largely through elections which take place from time 
time we elect governments but as someone aptly put it governments are really a big insurance company with an 
we the people pay premiums taxes for assured services such as education health sanitation justice and regulation and other 
safety net items and for defense of course but only indirectly do we control if at all all the 
activities that fall under the rubric of private capitalistic enterprises and these millions of private enterprises function by rules 
they function by topdown hierarchic chains ordered by shareholders and managers these entities in turn create physical entities and 
workers us to deliver a certain product or other this is highly successful and i daresay has been the 
driver in the success of modern democracies but capitalism a system which we all depend on is intrinsically not 
if it has its way it prefers the corporatist state a captured entity so at the very heart of 
practice of constitutional government of equal rights of equal protection of bedrock principles of free speech etc etc there 
this beast that is essentially selfseeking profitmaximizing determined to limit its liabilities as much as possible straining against any 
on its private mission so in general for capitalists some of the constitutional rules are really good for business 
some of the other rules which complete the circle so necessary i think this tension is inevitable within our 
practices complete hand waving and sloganeering his is without meaning very high quality podcast overall but some constructive feedback 
your sound engineer sean this one sounded like your guest was calling in on a cellular connection and using
