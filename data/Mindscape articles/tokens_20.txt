welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today talking about economics economics has always seemed like 
funny field to me on the one hand it can be extremely mathematical precise rigorous theorems are proven on 
other hand extraordinarily relevant to the messiness of everyday life and this ongoing tension between the pristine mathematics and 
messiness of reality furthermore in the united states at least right now people are wondering about what kind of 
we should have of course capitalism i think possible to deny that capitalism has done good things we have 
enormous growth over the last several hundred years on the other hand also impossible to deny that unchecked capitalism 
be extremely deleterious we need a social safety net etcetera some people even here in the us are looking 
controlled economies like they have in china with a little bit of envy a lot to be skeptical about 
the economic performance of the us right now sc on the one hand the stock market and gdp is 
on the other hand we have more inequality than had in a long time on the one hand unemployment 
low but on the other hand a lack of really good jobs easy to get a job but not 
that really earns you a living wage so some people are beginning to question the fundamental truths of received 
today talking to suresh naidu who is a professor of economics and international affairs at columbia university as well 
external professor at santa fe institute suresh is not a bombthrower not trying to overthrow the system or anything 
very interested in the relationship of economics to other big picture questions about how societies function does democracy promote 
what was the economic influence of slavery can we have equitable economic growth is it possible to have booming 
growth while we still have equality and still take care of the people who are not doing well in 
society sc so we go into questions about capitalism socialism been good questions about the labor market and inflation 
monopsony as well as monopoly a fascinating little intro to a whole bunch of big topics for people who 
not experts in economics including myself remember to check out our web page at preposterousuniversecommindscape one of the things 
have to remember is that we have show notes for every episode so you can find links to things 
for example in episode with suresh talking about a textbook that he and many other collaborators have been working 
an openly available textbook in economics you can find a link to that on the webpage so with that 
music sc suresh naidu welcome to the mindscape podcast suresh naidu thanks for having me sc been on record 
saying that i want to have more economics on the podcast to talk about lots of things sn my 
yeah sc okay a lot there but a little bit intimidating decided intimidating because what i do for a 
dark matter the origin of the universe it affect daily lives their daily bread their jobs etcetera but economics 
relentlessly practical in some way so so much economics is not the kind of high abstract theoretical stuff that 
love so much but really downtoearth trade and markets and labor and things what is the division of labor 
economics like that is it an accurate representation on my part sn so i would say that economics does 
certain parts of it that are actually really are about describing big impersonal forces that wind up constraining or 
what our everyday lives look like and much in the same way that gravity or ecology or atmospheric pressure 
a real thing in our lives and we necessarily understand it all but what physics and the rigorous study 
these things do is let you understand these forces that are just really important in your life and then 
i think many physicists also think this that one of the things you learn when you understand these forces 
that you get some insight into what are the tools for manipulating them what are the constraints on those 
what are the orders of magnitude of scale that you can like humans can reasonably move with what kinds 
instruments and so i would say at that level of abstraction very similar a bunch of things in economics 
are about describing patterns of global trade macroeconomic forces that are really impersonal big things that are kind of 
aggregated decisions of billions of people showing up sn but then one of the benefits of understanding that is 
you then understand how well what is the minimum wage going to or can central banks do with the 
what are the places that you have these touch points that you can push a lever to do something 
maybe make things a little bit and so i think not so far away i think sc well yeah 
thinking is there the economics by the way do you say eeconomics or eckconomics sn eckonomics it depends on 
country chuckle sc just checking that i doing a faux pas there is there the equivalent of string theorists 
mathematical physicists who never look at data whatsoever never apply their stuff to the real world are there purely 
brain economists who just work out general principles or does basically everyone dip their fingers into the muddy waters 
reality sn i mean you must know the answer to that yeah so as you know as you probably 
the whole century of economics was dominated by basically brilliant mathematical theorists sc yeah sn everyone from kenneth arrow 
was a founder of sfi the santa fe institute and people like paul samuelson and just people whose entire 
on the world was building these incredibly elegant theories that would capture some very deep fundamental truths about the 
markets worked or the way political institutions could work or just the tools for understanding what it meant to 
supply and demand equal to each other and i would say overwhelmingly for the century economics was in this 
well what it meant to do good economics was you built mathematical models but what it meant if you 
really good mathematical theorist is that then you went off and did empirical work and looked at the world 
ah yes laughter sn but i do yeah sc so not only is there that distinction in economics but 
same status hierarchy sn yeah a axel leijonhufvud i can never pronounce his name but he had an article 
life among the econs where he takes an anthropological lens to the economists and say they have their fetishes 
are called models and you have the highest caste group who are like the manipulators and creators of these 
and so that was really economics i think in the century and then i think what has been a 
but i think positive development is that social scientific data became our microscope and just made it starting in 
and things even with the rise of labor market data like the current population survey like the individual files 
the census and the computational power to process them it became now a world where you really had to 
enough to just have a cute idea about how this theoretical force might work you actually had to sort 
provide some evidence that it mattered and it also enough to just sort of say supply equal chuckle sn 
that that would obviously answer all of these questions because it became something that we actually had to look 
how important are these supply and demand forces relative to the background noise just going on in society and 
of these other things maybe mathematically right but quantitatively sc right right sn and that becomes something that we 
to look at so both a measurement angle of the rise of government surveys a way in which the 
of government themselves generate so much data running a ui system social security in european countries administering corporatist wage 
between unions and firms it just like as those processes became more routinized and bureaucratic they generated a huge 
of data that was then also kind of a great social science microscope sc so the big data era 
sn a big data era i would say a little in the style of economics that i come out 
we were always using the biggest data sets that you could get your hands on and yes some things 
changed with big data but in some ways like a lot of the principles that we had with small 
just a computational problem not a conceptual problem yeah and i want to say an important part of that 
kind of a i think also since the late has been a real attention to what say is causality 
causal identification sc oh okay yeah sn so that it enough so basically there was a lot of shoddy 
around correlations and saying see this correlation shows that this theory is but never not nearly as much of 
kind of paying attention to looking at the parts of the world that look like generating natural experiments or 
where something has just shifted all of a sudden and then a particularly clean test of a theory and 
basically the rise of this causal revolution in economics really sort also changed how we use data so that 
really became attentive that you just mine a data set and look for whatever correlations that you wanted you 
to really commit to a design that was like here is a control group a treatment group look at 
difference and make sure that those things are comparable on every other sc sure this is a very unfair 
but is there one big lesson that has been learned since we have been paying attention to these big 
sets and causality and things like that or is it many little lessons sn say a couple of big 
but what think of as big depends on what you kind of care about in the world one thing 
of a lot of papers got written on and kind of answered the question which is like the rate 
return to a year of sc oh okay sn and basically fifteen years of trying to estimate that using 
sorts of clever things about lotteries and distance to universities and trying to get this kind of experimental variation 
roughly get a ball park number of between and so sc and in what just sn in terms of 
earning additional earnings yeah sc okay salary rate of salary yeah sn another one though sc sorry and that 
a difficult thing because of course education is correlated with a whole bunch of other things sn yeah your 
to go to school is correlated with your ability all of this other stuff sc and your parents sn 
and your parents and your income and all this stuff and so finding places where you could actually say 
this person to school generated increased their earnings by i think a and we kind of have sc and 
that elementary school high school college grad school any of those sn so places that we have a reasonably 
i think is in the high school to college range sc okay sn sort of at least my familiarity 
that evidence kind of lives but held up as one the as a victory in labor economics is that 
sort of know that a positive rate of return to schooling sc stay in school kids sn stay in 
yeah the although not at any price so there sc sure sure sure sn only the other thing which 
to go into because i know a lot about it is like this endless debates on the minimum wage 
basically this almost as long as been a minimum wage economists have argued about whether or not on net 
jobs and i say that like settled now but i think like to settled now sc which is super 
in social sciences sn which is super good and who knows it might get overturned we might get a 
new wave of studies that just flip this around see particularly as the minimum wages at some point going 
you just keep ratcheting up the minimum wage i think at some point you start to see effects but 
think one of the other successes of this causal identification turn has been really getting clean estimates of the 
okay suppose the minimum wage does kill jobs if it does a very small number sc the result is 
the minimum wage roughly speaking kill jobs sn kill very many jobs sc does not cause unemployment sn yeah 
so if yeah so you can imagine that a increase in the minimum wage will cost no more than 
jobs sc okay sn that is the kind of estimates after and that is something incredibly cuts to the 
of so many priors about what markets are like if supply is equal to the demand and then you 
a minimum wage then that has to reduce employment just what the graph says sc well i mean just 
put that in other words saying the same thing if employees cost more money going to have less of 
yeah and gary becker i think literally said this like gravity goes the wrong way but i think one 
the useful things about this transformation of economics into a much more empirical much more what we call identificationbased 
has been that we are able to take things that were just kind of somewhat ideological articles of faith 
how markets must work sc just test some the data sn test them and find yeah it often in 
of markets supply does equal demand and in some markets more complicated sc well so supply and demand i 
the impression from not only reading your stuff but other people that economists know the following that in econ 
teach you that markets are the best in supply and demand control everything and then in econ one hundred 
and every subsequent course all we talk about is how the market fails and how we have to fix 
sn yeah and then also econ which is like how the attempts to fix them sc also fails sn 
fail chuckle sn and then econ which is how you actually in order to fix the government failures you 
actually need a specific set of market failures to anyway so we can keep going but i think roughly 
at first pass yeah sc so if our intuition about why the minimum wage should cause unemployment is wrong 
how should we think about the minimum wage sn so i think this comes to the other thing that 
want to talk about which is just what do labor markets actually look like and they look like a 
in which particularly at the bottom end in which employers are not taking the market wage as given where 
have some leeway to choose wages because they have to manage because workers have perfect turnover across a job 
me put that in a different way so when i cut my wage by as an employer what fraction 
my workers disappears in the next say one to three years and standard economic theory would say everyone has 
leave instantaneously and it sc get a better job elsewhere sn get a better job elsewhere but what you 
in the data when you actually get those kinds of experiments is roughly like which is not zero so 
the market forces are there but also and also not like everyone immediately like over a year it takes 
while and so what that means is that employers have some discretion because they can be like i can 
a wage maybe a little bit lower than be i might be willing to pay because save on payroll 
might have to endure a little bit of higher turnover but worth it to me in exchange for what 
can save on sn and so then if employers are then kind of trading off this wages and turnover 
is very intuitive if you look at any hr textbook kind of what they tell you like if worried 
turnover you should think about the wage setting then that means that one of the things that when it 
when the minimum wage goes up is that you kind of forced to raise a higher wage and so 
get lower turnover as a result and then that offsets any additional cost of labor that you might have 
with faced from the additional minimum wage so you can think of it this way and a paper that 
this sc so sorry that was backwards from what we were just talking about you were just saying if 
lower the wages people should leave but they and now saying if you raise the wages the employers cut 
sn so starting from a place where employers have set the wage such that enduring a given level of 
and paying a low wage and so then imagine the minimum wage comes in and forces them to pay 
higher wage and so then like now they have to take that higher wage but as kind of a 
they get lower sc okay yeah sn and so why you see necessarily so many jobs getting destroyed is 
this offsetting force of the lower turnover sc and they were willing to pay that much all along is 
of this theory sn well no costing them profits sc costing them profits sn and passing along some of 
to consumers for sure sc okay sn so both of those things happen but i sc there still is 
and demand sn there still is yeah but one of the things you see is this immediate cost in 
sc yeah okay sn because of this offset in decreased turnover and so what you actually see when you 
see recruits and quits kinda separately is that see that when a paper that looked at this in the 
that found that new hiring falls but separations fall the exact same amount and so why kind of a 
loss you hire fewer new workers but your existing workers quit nearly as much and so you shrink in 
employment sc in both cases in the fact that the workers leave immediately if their wages are lowered and 
fact that the employers hire far fewer people if minimum wage comes in sort of a stickiness or a 
in sort of physics terms right an ideal system where things work a certain way but the world is 
from ideal is that fair sn yeah talk about that i feel like that is often how taught economics 
is that the perfectly competitive frictionless world is analogous to the ideal gas like this is the thing that 
any other information you should think that it looks like this and then bolt things onto this apparatus in 
to make it look more like reality and so of mixed minds about that like yeah a pretty powerful 
to work partly because that perfect competition thing comes with a bunch of mathematical things that make it really 
and they get sc improved things yeah sn and you can communicate it very easily to other economists everyone 
what it looks like it is very powerful but for certain things also terribly misleading and such and particularly 
i guess this is just my hobby horse is that particularly around things around the labor market but i 
also say the land market and the credit market these markets where lots of it gets complicated that the 
competition assumption does more violence to the reality than might be acceptable and we yet have a benchmark a 
for that frictionless world still kinda hovering around it but i feel like if you looked at theoretical models 
that are even trying to be quantitatively made more resemble the real world they have to adopt as baseline 
departures from that frictionless world so let me give you a concrete example sn if you want a world 
which any kind of role for monetary policy for example from the central bank you need a world in 
prices are sort of sticky and so to get just like as a first pass these are what are 
new keynesian kind of models is that you need models where where not all firms can adjust all their 
instantaneously and so a couple of tricks for getting that one is like a monopolistic competition and like a 
price setting and one modeling trick that is kind of becomes almost another benchmark in all of the models 
need to talk about monetary policy because really hard to get a role for monetary policy in a model 
have that kind of friction one sort of many canonical model that talks about that let me give you 
example on the internet sc but sorry but the idea is your underlying claim is that the very idea 
a frictionless model being the good starting point is so far away from reality that just not even a 
starting point sn not even a good starting point or i wonder about it yeah sc i blame galileo 
all this by the way in physics sn oh yeah like how what sc well galileo overturned aristotelian physics 
objects he says will actually fall at the same rate and you can do an experiment and drop a 
and a feather and they fall at the same rate and i think that galileo gets credit for being 
first one to say they would if it for air right and he set that the paradigm of physics 
ignore as much as we can ignore and then put everything back in later sn very interesting i heard 
dated back to galileo sc sure a bit of selection effect of giving credit to famous people but you 
that he was synthesizing things that other people did but i think that that paradigm of imagining a world 
friction without dissipation and so forth and then you can build on that to get the real world i 
galileo gets as much credit for it as anyone sn got it interesting very interesting chuckle sc but no 
why it has to work where things are strongly coupled and nonlinear like they are in economics sn yeah 
it kind of feels like it should depend on the problem that trying to solve for some problems air 
is the thing that you actually care about sc exactly right yes a whole other limit where moving through 
not air in which you start by assuming frictionless sn at least how i think about it and i 
want to point out lots of ways in which this frictionless world is not just a theoretical construct it 
embedded into how do we construct various measures of national income and in government statistics construction a surprising amount 
folk theorizing that goes into even core economic measurement that always like should we really believe and so i 
wanted to flag that not purely theoretical things it matters for how we actually measure the world sc well 
closely related to this minimum wage question is the monopsony question sn monopsony question which is i just gave 
the short version of that sc exactly well we can use the technical term here a useful one sure 
heard of monopoly where one company that has all the products monopsony sn first let me clarify so that 
power i guess is just just that you have some ability to set the price so that you have 
take the market price as given you can instead have some control over what price you set if you 
the price a little bit you lose all of your customers immediately again like that sort of thing lose 
but not everyone and so kind of the the monopsony is basically the flip side of that for the 
market where you think about wages sn instead of a firm having to take the market wage given it 
has some discretion to set the wage so let me give you some and so this like and one 
the things when they do have this discretion they can manage it and say you know going to pay 
little bit of a lower wage and accept the additional and that same thing i explained a little bit 
but let me just give some very concrete sort of real world so for example you can go online 
can find these leaked slides from hr program talking about club and how they set pay and so it 
out one of the things very interesting in that is that they talk about how if you actually if 
club needs to set a wage really different from the national wage policy they need to apply to bentonville 
for a special exemption sc okay sn so that suggests that they sc the headquarters sn the headquarters yes 
yeah sn and so that suggests that not the case that every walmart has to exactly pay the sc 
local wage sn in that labor market in fact the national wage policy another paper by a coauthor of 
and his coauthors and leonard was looking at this national retailer that basically had a policy that gave you 
raise that depended very discontinuously on your previous wage so if you had if you were making like one 
over some threshold you were got a very different raise than if you were making one penny below sc 
okay chuckle sn and so what you can do is look to see what happens to quits among those 
do workers differentially leave just around that based on the change in the raise that they got turns out 
that many left when they get the same raise relative to those that did suggesting again that again not 
a huge responsiveness to the wage in the labor market but i think also evidence about this is also 
for is that the very fact you could have this like weirdo wage raise policy where you had all 
discontinuities in it is not just the kind of thing that you think that comes out of a smooth 
taking sc no sn where you would just have to naturally it would look like airline prices where have 
of round numbers and the things would be like a much smoother distribution but the fact that when you 
at a wage policy and you see all this bunching and kinking and all of this stuff suggests that 
real room for human decisionmaking sc and there are also an information problem i mean we have the social 
that we ask each other what getting as a salary right sn yeah sc and that certainly helps the 
setting salaries sn it does it does and some very interesting studies on this by the way i should 
been the great campaign by coworkerorg meant to make these like kind of online spreadsheets where workplaces can share 
salaries and become like an important kind of labor organizing tool sc actually seen that for science journalists with 
magazine set rates are sn oh yeah oh great yeah sc not publicly available but shared yeah sn shared 
yeah so kinda exactly like creating information about what wages are also kind of a great study done by 
professors at uc berkeley so if at berkeley wages are public for all public employees and so what they 
is they actually randomized showing some workers a link to the pay of their coworkers and others not and 
to see the job search and quit behavior of those that got the ability to compare their wages to 
peers and they find that those that are making below what their peers are making are more likely to 
sc leave a lot more okay good information is power chuckle sn yeah so i just think that like 
of some immediate evidence that the labor market look like the market for chairs sc no okay not frictionless 
okay sn and not like this law of one price and another piece of evidence that sort of come 
from this big era of big data is this availability of matched worker firm data that where you can 
the same worker being employed by different firms over time and you can see how much of their wage 
depending on what firm that at versus who they are so you can imagine if the labor market was 
frictionless the wage would just depend on you not which firm you were at because all firms should be 
the same labor market sc right you have an intrinsic worth and they pay it sn and they pay 
yeah exactly like your human capital captures this priced and every company has to pay the same price for 
so but what you in fact see is that considerable movement of individual wages so something between and of 
wage variation that we see is explained by the firm that at not just who you are and so 
suggests that given this reasonably important role for firms that again like this kinda room for all these frictions 
deviation so i guess i know if that i know if an analog in physics for the kind of 
really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal 
the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but 
this leads into the real world question of low wage jobs been a lot less of rebounding in the 
wage sector than the highwage sector since the financial crisis if i understand correctly and some people have blamed 
other people have blamed globalization and this sort of labor market stickiness is a different explanation sn yes yes 
i want to be clear a bunch of those other a bunch of the explanations do have not going 
deny the trade with china has had a huge effect on american jobs and like a big that is 
big factor automation i think a little bit premature i know that we have really amazing evidence that automation 
really leveled american employment sc andrew yang is very worried about it we know that right sn yes well 
but i feel like kind of i feel like his fantasy that american capitalism goes through every couple of 
is like in the like robots are sc well it seems to me like a perpetual belief that jobs 
disappear because of automation but it always seems to be true that other jobs pop up but maybe that 
forever sn and who knows i know if like an iron law or that just might be a law 
as things that humans have a comparative advantage in relative to machines but i do want to suggest that 
way in which the we also want to flag that currently at record low unemployment like kind of insanely 
unemployment hot hot labor market and yet seeing that really difficult to pick up increases in wages in this 
sc which again goes against our intuition from econ sn yes exactly and that it it also points against 
of the automation and trade stories because like if those stories were the main thing going on then expect 
see it show up on unemployment as well as wages sc yeah sn while if oh but if you 
really low unemployment but seeing low wage growth it brings you to like kind of a different category of 
so i want to say that monopsony is like the only or main thing going on here i know 
do think it is interesting that one of a lot of the forces that have countervailed monopsony have just 
in slow decline so like so a lot of the things that took the wagesetting power out of the 
of firms have just over fiftyseven years have just declined and sc because of changes in government policy or 
i would say some of it is changes in government policy some of it is these other technology and 
things so you could imagine a big chunk of the effect of trade is via hammering union manufacturing jobs 
part of them were relocating the right to work to the states and that got hastened by globalization and 
you have more and more sc for those who know right to work is basically like right to not 
in the union sn right to not be in the union and so just and both relentless government hostility 
unions particularly since the so you can think of those two things happening together and so that this erosion 
this institution that pushed back against that sort of curbed monopsony but also made us think that it a 
problem which is an interesting history of thought kind of thing that in the and labor economists who are 
like the high priests of mathematical theory but these are the people that were working you know they were 
at harvard and princeton and berkeley and they were also employed in the national war labor board to like 
in wage setting involved in unionfirm negotiations and they very much had the idea that the labor market when 
was not regulated looked like monopsony and that firms had a sc so an old idea sn an old 
sc and not exactly the sn yeah i invent it by no means and it was not invented in 
last twenty years like joan robinson who is in my mind the greatest economist of the century i just 
to say that so that more people look up who she is and had a very interesting life sc 
was she working sn so in the and in the and so she was one of compatriots in cambridge 
one of the people in that circle of british economics in midcentury and so she comes up with it 
one of these economists that partly because of who she is and stuff like always arguing with the marxists 
so takes their ideas very seriously but like arguing with sc constructive argument not just trying to discourage yeah 
constructive argument you can kind of see monopsony as like kind of a sort of somewhat of a genesis 
that coming out of some of those conversations and when labor economists heard about this theoretical thing they were 
totally sc makes sense sn and so a great quote i love from this paper by clark kerr who 
a labor economist in which is like yes yes this theory of like he called it but monopsonistic competition 
be relevant for like laissez faire labor markets but the labor markets of the future are going to be 
and unionized and so this kind of monopsony thing really a relevant object of study because headed to a 
where going to be in the so he wrote that in sc so he thought that the workers would 
monopsony basically sn yes so he might have got the effect of unionization on monopsony right but he got 
timeframe of unionization totally wrong sc yeah sn so i think that an interesting history of thought partly but 
because those old they were called institutionalist labor economists really got the idea that there is a considerable amount 
discretion that firms have in wage setting that it just like this frictionless supply and demand they had this 
that there was a band of wages that wages could be set around in this band and that there 
considerable leeway within that band so that was like a way of adding frictions sc hysteresis or something like 
sn yeah yeah yeah so i yeah not sure how i got back to this but i think this 
that the labor market is a particularly a place where these frictions are important and so if you really 
about studying low wages and labor market outcomes you kind of need to depart from the frictionless model to 
it right sc yeah and is my vague feeling correct that organized labor has just been declining in power 
decades sn yes yeah absolutely it takes a particular sharp downturn in the early some of the recession some 
that is just generic employer like employer hostility something actually a paper working on is just trying to document 
change in norms that just seems like you have all of a sudden this tip in norms among employers 
before they were kind of playing softball with unions be like well you can go on strike we fire 
though they had all kinds of legal powers to fight unions with more vigor they use them just because 
the norms against them and then that just flips in the they all of a sudden become like truce 
off now going to fire workers during strikes and replace them with permanent sc and the reagan administration certainly 
that along sn and the reagan administration is kind of like a green light to jumpstart that so i 
all part of the sauce of going on i know that i mean also structural ways in which american 
british and australian unions are organized that makes it hard to imagine how they could come back in the 
that they existed because organized on an enterprise basis rather than on a whole labor market basis in europe 
are sectorwide and they got in them or at least covered by them and in the us been this 
by firm kind of organizing model and just a really uphill battle for unions i know that unions are 
to come back in the form that they looked like i do think something like them needs to come 
to sort if something that curbs the use of monopsony power by firms needs sc well i was going 
ask is that your prescription is there a best way to fight against this monopsony power sn yeah i 
think that some sort of way of workers getting a substantial voice in how wages are set collectively and 
difficult for the government to do it the government can impose a minimum wage but one of the things 
the government know is exactly a the mix of wages and benefits that workers want b how much of 
mix of whatever workers want are consistent with the business model and them making profits one reason why kind 
unions are kind of a better solution than government regulation in lots of places because they can customize the 
of a collective bargaining agreement to the particular needs of that workplace and those workers sc so still the 
market just that some organization on one side sn yeah so you can think of it i know i 
like most people that would say the free market would say well if you have to negotiate collectively then 
free but you kind of want it to be collective because you need that kind of balance of bargaining 
on both sides it has to be all of the workers at once sc maybe another term not the 
doing it sn not the government doing it decentralized i would say decentralized then bottomup but not free market 
guess sc well okay good this raises a whole bunch of deeper things successfully covered what i wanted to 
the second half of the interview in the first half so good fine sn we can go back to 
first half sc no how we roll here at mindscape we just follow the flow of the river i 
the free market capitalism how do you feel about these things how should we feel about these things be 
picture and ask certainly been enormous successes been dramatic failures i feel that there are people who are very 
profree market who love to bring up spectacular failures of central planning and there is exactly the opposite there 
people who are very antifree market who love to bring up the spectacular failures of capitalism and fewer people 
of talking to people who are who are close to them but slightly different across one divide do you 
a big opinion about this stuff or does the economics profession have big opinions about this stuff sn yeah 
way the economics profession does i think almost like a condition of membership is not allowed to have an 
about capitalism sc no i thought you loved capitalism sn well yeah generally like pro but the kind of 
that like trying to be scientific just going to sc like cosmologists being asked about the existence of god 
yes okay a couple of things one is no one should deny that the success of capitalism in raising 
standards of living has been kind of amazing in a world of historical break and cosma shalizi another sfi 
has a great line which is like the singularity already happened and it was the industrial revolution and we 
these eldritch forces loose and one of those is kind of letting people buy and sell stuff out of 
transactions and that kind of being a really great way to coordinate wants over very long distances sc people 
look online this charming short video with you in it where complaining about the lack of wifi on the 
in london and they you go well but then again eight hundred years ago they were dying of dysentery 
eating gruel so i be complaining sn exactly exactly so part of this textbook project which we should talk 
what irritates me to no end is when anticapitalists sort of somehow pretend that it was better before capitalists 
i have no sympathy for that argument an argument i do have some sympathy for is that not the 
counterfactual the counterfactual we should always be thinking about is how this is performing relative to what some other 
that we could have looking to the past generate the right counterfactual what you want to think about is 
possible future and do there exist other economic organizations ways of organizing the economy that given the technologies that 
have that might actually be a better fit and might result in more human flourishing less inequality more environmental 
all these good things that we want could we do better and i feel like we do ourselves a 
of favors by pretending that the thing that got is the best that it could possibly be sn and 
friend of mine glen weyl says like an engineer looking at the telegraph and thinking got to be the 
way to communicate sc we perfected it yeah sn yeah got it and we should as social scientists as 
be thinking about doing things better and some of just policy fixes within the orbit of capitalism and we 
talk about lots of those and things like healthcare and antitrust and minimum wages and some of them might 
things that kind of strike more to the core of what makes capitalism distinctive which you can think of 
making private property a little bit more of an elastic concept you can imagine in an economy where the 
resources are ideas that putting those in the shackles of private ownership and in patents and in monopoly rights 
of not necessarily doing ourselves the best giving ourselves the best chance of success sc well and these days 
you can patent or copyright genes or algorithms and things like that it seems bizarre to me it maybe 
what saying not a comfortable fit where we to these concepts that were brought up in the context sn 
manufacturing sc farms and cows sn yeah yeah or even sc or mills sn trading widgets and that when 
have these goods that are like as symbols almost like future of resources a high fixed cost zero marginal 
kinds of goods that shackling them with the institutions of capitalism maybe not a great fit and then other 
that are procapitalist will say yes been said at every technological change is that capitalism is no longer a 
fit and what always see is that it winds up sort of still doing a better job than any 
system so sc because private property and property rights are like the central tenet sn definitely like a big 
of it sc i do just be a little procapitalist for a second sn yup sc i think of 
as a search strategy right in some way capitalism is a way to find a certain kind of equilibrium 
has good properties people are innovative they try to do better they have incentives pointing in the right direction 
is your procapitalist sales pitch for someone never heard of it sn i think right i think like the 
that the way that you get prestige and status and material resources in capitalism is by making things that 
people want to buy sc yeah sn and a real break from how human history did it before which 
like you killed lots of people or like or you conquered lots of territory or something and so a 
institutional break is making the basis of social reward providing useful things to anonymous strangers sc so more of 
winwin right sn more of a winwin and so sc you benefit yourself by doing things that benefit other 
sn and i mean if you put it abstractly like that like what a great thing sc sure chuckle 
i think the limitations of that is that other things that you can do that are really profitable under 
that involve making useful things for other people sc well i wanted to sort of talk about the term 
used as sort of an epithet but i think probably most people in the street were like yeah people 
property and they rent it wrong with sn yeah chuckle so we should back up and define concepts so 
technically in economics is just defined as like a payment for something above and beyond its next payment that 
would guess and a next best alternative so making rents as a professor if be willing to do this 
for onetenth the salary and so then everything above that onetenth of my current salary is rents sc okay 
sounds like a sn right sc construal of the word rent sn yes but not completely alien to the 
use of payments for land because the idea was that an opportunity cost of land is zero it just 
there and so why landlords are like often the worst people in history like are they like chuckle sc 
met them yes all met them sn yeah just like and why often been called like social parasites is 
like a pure landlord in pure form is just sitting there collecting rent while the land that they own 
by virtue of a property right not actually doing anything to produce that value and you can imagine in 
real world developing and doing stuff but not the pure landlord function a developer function sc what going to 
like i mean to just be fair if any landlords in fact my friend karen if listening out there 
course real world people are often much better than just sitting in their home collecting the rents sn but 
think conceptually you can split apart the sc yeah a different role sn the development and maintenance of a 
with ownership rights of the land on top of that house sc yeah right sn and so why like 
opportunity cost of land pure land was zero and so all of the payments going to land were considered 
sc and but become a way of conceptualizing a certain kind of bad behavior under capitalism or a certain 
it work i know what to say sn well sometimes used that way i think in core in this 
project what we try to say is that an entrepreneur starting a new business seeing that some service that 
be offered not being offered and starting a business to do that rentseeking but because a rent there like 
gap between what the things that that that time and the cost of those materials and all of that 
what they could be getting by producing this good and selling it so getting a rent by supplying this 
thing sc okay it sound like such a bad thing in that sense sn and so i think productive 
in that like a lot of innovation and a lot of entrepreneurship is in fact chasing rents too as 
part of making the market work and part of how markets work is that people inside the market are 
rents all over the place and trying to meet needs and lower costs and things like that and so 
we prejudice the term rentseeking as necessarily a bad thing although i think when it is used in a 
way often referred to kind of like artificially raising barriers to entry like engaging in the kind of activities 
a zero sum so that like trying to raise your share of a pie at the expense of someone 
than trying to grow a pie sn but i think how used in a pejorative way but i think 
we can sort of say just like trying to get something trying to get a flow of income higher 
your opportunity cost and just to put a pin in it that opportunity cost is a pretty metaphysical idea 
chuckle so we say rents very casually but actually operationalizing a rent and what is sc i mean this 
an issue i think an issue in physics as well where we use words like energy and dimension and 
in a different way than people use them on the street in economics we also use words and struggle 
their definition a very related word i wanted to get to that i know you and other people were 
about on twitter recently namely neoliberalism and of course it starts with the word liberalism but then neo and 
think that maybe it goes back to reagan and thatcherera things but some people use it to mean bill 
and tony blair and some people just use it to mean everything good or everything bad sn so i 
a very clear statement of it is in a one thousand nine hundred fifty article in milton friedman where 
actually just literally explains what the doctrine of neoliberalism is and not libertarianism importantly it is not sc so 
would be the more pure free market sn more pure free market no need for a state even we 
need police for example sc or the night watchman sn well so i think the night watchman state might 
on the outer edges of neoliberalism but then in milton article he really does talk about the functions of 
should be to not distort the market but that also means that it needs to provide antitrust and might 
to do some sort of basic income provision and so sc so like a ubi like universal basic income 
of thing sn yeah so i think he uses the term but i think not unopposed to the idea 
the doing some nondistortionary redistribution sc milton friedman radical leftist sn well chuckle yeah but i think very important 
this is where it started with econ one hundred three and econ one hundred four is that the broad 
of neoliberalism is like the open markets is just free money and just always going to be both good 
prosperity fair on its own rights like what you get in the market is pretty close to what you 
deserve and we might need to fix it like with these very particular tools like we might need to 
some places make it a little bit more competitive or we might need to undo the worst excesses of 
by redistributing to the poor but the idea that you would broadly have to have the government intervene in 
variety of places inside the economy was like they were like no so in particular regulations and things like 
were seen as not particularly necessary because the market would fix it sc i guess yeah still little unclear 
this one sn yeah so talk through it sc i think the word should even be used people mean 
things by it sn okay so let me give i think a very clear i think which is just 
broad confidence in markets as the baseline mechanism for organizing the production overlapping conversation sc but i guess i 
to get at if the government passes a rule that is sort of safety standards for factories does that 
the market sn yes sc so explain why sn take a ridiculous sc sorry trying to contrast that with 
central planning that says here is the cost of this good sn we can come up with ridiculous regulations 
so there are some regulations so a good example is zoning restrictions in california sc mmhmm oh my goodness 
where endless numbers of people have pointed out how these restrictions on where and what you can build are 
all these other problems and so a very neoliberal take to them take on that which is like get 
of them and then a less confident and less articulate thing which is that well some of them might 
there for a reason and we just necessarily presume that all bad because they are restrictions on market that 
are some restrictions on markets that are in fact good even though they are distorting and even though they 
deviations from some sort of a more efficient benchmark because of either the kinds of communities that they support 
of the political coalitions they allow because of something else potentially noneconomic and an argument that we can have 
the sc so maybe beginning to get it in the sense that something like a safety regulation a rezoning 
counts as a distortion of the market because saying something you do in the market right sn some voluntary 
improving transaction that we the government will say that you cannot do sn right i could build a really 
deadly factory and people might want to work in it and the saying do that sn yeah sc okay 
it sn yeah and my favorite just to come back like my favorite example of a bit of the 
that rules out some of this is actually the amendment which says that literally not allowed to indenture myself 
can not sc even though you would willingly enter in that transaction sn even though i might be willing 
that was very conscious of the time because there was mexican peons in the new mexico territory that were 
debt bondage and that was one of the things that was coming up was like are they covered under 
amendment sc so you have issues with neoliberalism sn yeah i guess so i think also one of these 
way past its sellby date and it was also just like when i just think of the origins of 
many of the social problems that got now i just like it just feels like the history is borne 
that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the 
of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological 
is some people see it as so elastic but some people say like no there was a real tendency 
a real commonality that went through all of those administrations and this is the name that we give to 
sc and one of the things this is just physics prejudice showing through but one of the things that 
me is the relationship of various economic doctrines capitalism and nihilism neoliberalism for example to time right and one 
the big counterarguments against neoliberalism or capitalism maybe is that it has led to disasters of climate change because 
kind of things and we need to move beyond this sort of just adjust to what the market wants 
going to serve future generations but then a big philosophy question like on the one hand how much do 
owe to future generations and on the other hand previously guest astra taylor brings up this question of why 
we pay so much attention to the wishes of previous generations when people have their wills that are distributed 
certain ways or inheritances in certain ways sn and dead trust funds sc is there a way has this 
properly theorized the relationship of economics to future and past generations sn so there has been a lot of 
so an intuition from economics that probably other people thought of is that one of the things that you 
get is that future generations are also going to be richer than us just because of technological change sc 
hopes yes right sn yeah so for any given level of climate change some ways in which like future 
better equipped sn might be actually better off might have more tools to deal with it or in any 
might be richer and so not going i necessarily think this but some arguments for saying that if you 
going to do these tradeoffs across generations you might want to also take account of the kind of income 
across generations because we are poorer than our future than future generations are going to be so maybe earned 
little right sc unless we destroy the sn unless we destroy the planet so good that you said that 
puts a finger on a real deficiency of the way economists think about things which is that always thinking 
terms of smooth optimization problems and so like always some margin on which you could shift a little bit 
here versus but if dealing with these systems that have these big and cliffs and things like that then 
kind of thinking at the margin that economists are kind of trained to do work super well sc less 
sn less appropriate yeah and so i think a pretty deep i think criticism of economics is that this 
focus on thinking about what you can do at the margin where you have these kind you can always 
a little bit from choice a to choice b and so you just have to pick in between them 
when just like like a big gap in pass and so you need some other decision calculus sc well 
the opposite of i guess tyler cowen was a previous guest on the podcast and he has this point 
view that the best thing to do the morally best action is just to maximize economic growth because compound 
it catches up and also we should not discount future generations at all they are people just like us 
made him slightly disgruntled by calling him the temporal version of peter singer peter singer says we should count 
far away just as much as these kind of future people but i think it makes sense to me 
discount future generations so much uncertainty about what things will be like how can we possibly think that accurately 
what the future generations are going to have or not have sn yeah so i think the uncertainty makes 
complicated but then you get into these insane kind of calculations that effective altruism people do of the risk 
ai so basically once you start discounting for enough in the future sc insane but we have to do 
sn sorry sc insane but we also have to do them in some sense sn so we do have 
do them but i think the idea that you it feels like doing a lot of division by small 
and so you can make small quantities blow up by dividing by like a really really small number sc 
really big numbers by really small numbers you can get any number you want sn you get any number 
want so in that space with a lot of these future discounting calculations is it feels like again the 
of trying to think about the tradeoffs really wellsuited to that because the scales are just like up in 
air so we just have no idea what the magnitudes are so thinking quantitatively about tradeoffs at ten generations 
now not sure is super productive sc yeah so i take your point that sort of an attitude that 
that future generations will on the one hand be better equipped on the other hand know more about the 
is so maybe they should handle it sn but i also think mood for climate change like not here 
already feeling it sn my life is materially worse because of climate change sc i live in california so 
yeah so i feel like all this like oh how much do we wait the generations of the future 
that was a fifteen years ago conversation sc okay fair enough but i like the still the analogy of 
of the present to the future so go back to the present and inequality now and this has been 
longstanding thing among economists they measure progress by gdp or something like that and less by how the worse 
people are doing is there am i crazy in thinking there seems to be more attention now paid to 
of inequality sn yeah absolutely absolutely a nobel laureate in my first year of grad school at berkeley i 
like interested in studying inequality and he was very smart he said like really cares about studying equality except 
french the french really like studying and he was absolutely right about one of those things but i think 
changed i think occupy wall street played some role i think bernie sanders i think the actual just continuing 
of inequality has done its own work so sorry go ahead sc not let that go by too quickly 
is fairly agreed upon that in the last some number of years maybe you should tell me rather then 
guessing inequality has been increasing sn yeah no i think nobody can deny that inequality has increased over the 
forty years sc yeah in the us in the uk in almost everywhere although the magnitude of the increase 
much muted in the continental countries people will argue about exactly how much and there are calculations you can 
that can get you a range that looks oh it so bad or it was sc but gone up 
in the more neoliberal countries sn yes it has gone up more in the more anglo countries almost for 
also gone up a lot though in developing countries so countries that have grown a lot like india sc 
but i said neoliberal countries sn yeah yeah yeah so i think that and so one of the interesting 
think recent areas of research is the stuff pursued by piketty and saez and zucman come out of that 
french research program which is the idea of distributional national accounts which is that instead of just keeping track 
the aggregate gdp of a country keep track of it by percentile and so then you get an easy 
which is look at median gdp instead of like mean and median will just get you pretty much the 
in which the percentile is doing and not a bad proxy for also capturing how evenly distributed the growth 
sc and a nice kind of marketing ploy no one can argue with collecting more data or paying attention 
more data right not normative sn well people can argue just like it comes in with the national accounts 
a lot of folk theory goes into the construction of the measures and so you have to argue a 
on both lots of people are arguing about what are the folk theories that are going into constructing these 
and so where an active argument on twitter and things like that and so sc choosing what to pay 
to is a big choice not innocent sn yeah yeah exactly and what assumptions you make about allocating dollars 
things gets into the weeds and it matters sc okay but anyway inequality is increasing sn yeah sc probably 
should do something about that i guess opinions will differ on how much a problem sn people i think 
are lots of people who think like no we do anything but well we should just pick poverty lots 
people think that sc what do you think sn i think you get a flourishing society with insane amounts 
inequality sc so just again lay it out there certainly i think that my youthful self would have been 
of saying if everyone is better off it matter that some people are way better off still better so 
there an intrinsic value to equality sn i just think lots of things lots of dimensions of things that 
important that are in fact zero sum and so when you have this kind even just something very basic 
relative status in society is basically kind of a thing that because relative got to be zero sum and 
when you have enormous income inequality and roughly correlated with this it means that some people are very low 
and just not great for a good healthy democratic society and so that itself is a once you have 
things that are zero sum that are correlated with that come along with income inequality a good reason to 
the income inequality and so those zero sum things can include relative status they can include political power they 
include cultural representation in society a bunch of things that are not just expanding the pie but where the 
of the pie really means that some people are made worse off sc and is the solution to this 
simple as changing the tax code wealth taxes or inheritance taxes or just a more progressive tax system sn 
hope so because the only other thing is we either do it through the bet is that the only 
in which seen inequality of this type fall in the past is with social catastrophes sn yeah okay sn 
either an internal revolution or external war walter scheidel has a book the great leveler that makes this point 
the bet which is that we are progressed enough as a society as a civilization we have enough tools 
government and enough tools of reason in the society that we can actually use policy to reduce inequality without 
to go through a war sc right so hope slash aspiration sn so one of the reasons for thinking 
the goals as like a wealth tax and these things is like guys we have to worry about millions 
dead people if we can actually get these relatively mild policy things into and you can imagine similar with 
change like one way or another the climate is going to fix us sc a human brain just meant 
think to reason on these time scales if someone is very wealthy right now and has never seen a 
in their lifetime the prospect just seem real to them right laughter sn and so maybe for their own 
that take it from them but i think the thing like yeah they will fight it and hopefully the 
is that if doing it through the democratic process is a way to get it peacefully to do it 
while maintaining democratic institutions and sc certainly see the eyes grow wide among the cohort of wealthy democratic donors 
the prospect that elizabeth warren could get nominated and start taxing their sn and i mean good good i 
sc someone said on twitter if the rest of us had as much class solidarity as the billionaires do 
they call each other on the phone and tell each other sc exactly chuckle sn yeah one of the 
about the wealth inequality thing that i think piketty and others have made apparent which is actually something i 
at the santa fe institute a long time ago which is this idea of law for wealth that basically 
assets have these stochastic multiplicative returns so they just kind of grow at a random rate that that can 
you an extremely skewed distribution of wealth sc and so these parallels are just very natural outcomes of network 
building on each other sn yeah cumulative processes but yeah sc and that explains why a good old revolution 
the best way sn yeah that is the other way you get it or you can think that what 
do is you damp down the growth parameter and never going to get rid of it but you can 
it by taxing wealth kind of curbing that growth happening every year and sort of still get out into 
parallel but just the thinness of the tail will be less sc so the sales pitch to the wealthy 
is rather have a wealth tax than the guillotine sn yeah chuckle i think they know that at some 
sc probably know that sn i think at another level like this the society they themselves grew up in 
i think they feel some of them at least might feel some guilt for that sc at a more 
level do you have a favorite strategy maybe wealth taxes serve some purpose but other things to do also 
like i said earlier i think something like the labor movement has to come back both for political reasons 
it was a way for so many regular people to have their voices aggregated to be expressed politically it 
so many working class people to run for office it was just like this broadbased kind of institution that 
in the had of the american workforce in it that just did a lot to compress the income distribution 
i think when i think of what committed to is trying to figure out how to use social science 
things to help resuscitate something that looks like a labor movement sc are you personally in favor of a 
income sn i think not really actually an interesting idea to play with i be opposed if we got 
but i do think a way in which a see a lot of the gains undone by monopoly pricing 
secondly that a real sense in which work and the fact of having to go and interact productively with 
that are not like you is just like a real great glue sc you i mean completely open to 
possibility my mind is very open about ubi and glad that certain local jurisdictions are experimenting with it you 
collect the data right but i think almost everyone will still work even if they had a basic income 
sc yeah that might in which i think fine then it just becomes like a not a transformation of 
in any way just like a little extra cash sc you raise the floor for the people who sn 
if not raising the floor enough to get some people to opt out then not raising the floor that 
sc yeah maybe literally thinking of people on skid row in los angeles who could afford a studio apartment 
there were ubi sn yeah i think a lot of that my optimist side would also think that a 
of the other pathologies and pain that comes with being poor would be less if you were just less 
and sc giving people sn not a bad idea sc but it is expensive i get it sn yeah 
you could do a ubi maybe not this year but in ten years american society could easily afford a 
ubi in fact a very easy way to do it right now which is just take the earned income 
credit that we already do and then just like so my friend proposes make it so that you get 
if not working just getting some positive amount but then if you work more you get even more via 
itc then that disincentives like then people get a basic income but there are still some additional incentives to 
and that might actually be both the kind of the best of both worlds sc yeah okay time to 
up but i want to give you an opportunity to promote at least two different things one is the 
of economics for inclusive prosperity did i get that right sn yep the idea of that was me and 
rodrik and gabriel zucman were at a conference with intellectual historians and sociologists it was at casbs at stanford 
it was about neoliberalism and all of these other social scientists were like is responsible for and we were 
are you talking and basically so we started this initiative to just collect policy ideas and get a group 
economists that were doing progressive policy that were doing work in progressive policy circles but it just getting heard 
either policy makers or even other social sciences and so we were like put up this flag that suggests 
is in fact at least a community of economists that are sc well good branding goes a long way 
letting people know sn yeah and see what comes up and so that was kind of and gotten some 
mean some of the policy memos are really fantastic that and also giving people like economists that have really 
ideas sc sorry what does it mean inclusive prosperity sn a generic nice thing like who could be against 
prosperity sc exactly yeah sn but the idea that like economic growth not enough to just consider the level 
economic growth you also want to consider its distribution and you just want to consider economic growth narrowly as 
you want to consider the broad measures of human sn that ideal we talked about sn but yeah and 
price of entry is one of these five to policy memos that builds on your research or something worked 
and talks about an idea for either a policy maker to run with or just a view on a 
to make the world better and so these policy briefs that have come back have been really fantastic and 
interesting so i just encourage everyone to go check it out at econfiporg sc alright we will link to 
in the show notes that sounds great sn okay and what was the other thing you wanted me sc 
sorry before we go onto the other thing it does remind i wanted to just ask a little bit 
the duty that you have as a social scientist or an economist in particular there was just a conference 
santa fe i know if you were there sn no i missed it yeah sc it seemed to be 
the live tweeting there seemed to be a lot of ragging on economists on the basis of abandoning their 
responsibilities you know geoffrey west said like economists leading the battle against climate and so always thought that perfectly 
to be a scientist even a social scientist who just tries to describe what happens in the world but 
okay as a field there might be an obligation to intervene constructively in some ways sn okay so the 
obligation of economists sc well i know so asking you if you think that there is one do you 
that if you sn do no harm chuckle sc well yeah do no harm would be would be a 
one i guess the argument i buy is that there are experts who have a certain kind of special 
and if clear that that particular kind of expertise could be deployed to make the world a better place 
at least some fraction of people who have that expertise should do that very milquetoasty statement sn yeah so 
think true and i think that does happen i think find that economists are much more involved in policymaking 
almost any other social science and some of them are i think working on climate like my colleagues here 
on climate change all the time i know that we have more of a responsibility than physicists laughter sc 
no actually neither do i i think the philosophy that i just outlined and i necessarily hold very strongly 
trying to figure it out myself i think that for the most part academics intellectuals scholars should try to 
true things about the world but right next to doing good things in the world and i admit that 
connection there sn i would be happy if we just restricted ourselves to saying true things about the world 
partly that the field has been is has been ideologically riven in a way the most fields are not 
ideologically riven because actual conservatives in economics in a way that there in lots of other fields chuckle sc 
sn and so there are actually political disagreements and so i have a paper on this how you can 
predict using the language of an academic article you can do a pretty good job predicting campaign contributions sc 
okay yeah sn and in economics sc well because it really reveals some of their values in some sense 
sn and yeah so going to have people with diverging values inside the same discipline and i know that 
discipline should say everybody should be if you have these divergent values and real disagreements over things sc well 
the valence goes either way if someone legitimately believes that something that would make the world a better place 
question is then whatever that thing is that they think would make the world a better place is there 
obligation to do it i think that a individuallevel obligation but maybe there is a disciplinewide obligation sn yeah 
i think if the discipline agreed on what those things were it would be a but i know that 
agree sc probably it and the other thing was you mentioned a textbook sn oh yeah so part of 
big open me and sam bowles and others and many other people in the circle of santa fe the 
fe institute have been for a long time involved in a textbook project called core coreeconorg and basically a 
online open source textbook not just a usual way of teaching aimed to be an introduction to economics textbook 
it really presents introductory economics in a way really different from every other textbook and every other textbook is 
of the same to each other and what really trying to do is trying to say that economics is 
just supply and demand not just the frictionless model and so how we try to teach it and simon 
another sfi person drew the analogy that core is to traditional economics what the feynman lectures were to the 
teaching of the day which was sc might as well throw that in sn to grab sort of the 
that are happening on the research frontier and make them intelligible and useful to people that are encountering it 
the first time the idea that if never going to take another economics class should you think the world 
like the frictionless model or should you get this library of gadgets for thinking about the world sc okay 
good is it out sn out online and you can just go and look at it you can order 
from oxford university press sc like a real book an actual paper book not okay very good sn yep 
a real book also online will always be online and for free but if you also want it sc 
big believer in real books as well alright suresh naidu thank you so much for being on the podcast 
thank you so much for having me great music sean carroll one of the big counterarguments against neoliberalism or 
maybe is that it has led to disasters of climate suresh naidu life is materially worse because of climate 
an economist with a physics background and a little depressing to see how superficial sean carroll and suresh views 
climate change are since otherwise seem like extremely curious scholars seen this a lot in the past two decades 
smart people who will talk about climate change as some existential threat despite almost no climate scientists stating that 
is reading the new york times and the guardian do not make one an informed citizen on this topic 
they repeatedly have quoted alarmist outliers like james hanson they read the ipcc reports and at best will read 
often distorted summary for policy makers which is written by politicians and activists so far there have been no 
change disasters the ipcc states this in the science sections and standard of living has not dropped one penny 
to climate change thus far nor will it amiga three thousand about climate change as some existential threat despite 
no climate scientists stating that it can you elaborate on this i think biologists will agree that climate changes 
existential threats to species that directly or indirectly depend on a certain climate to survive if the climate is 
there is going to be an impact considering the amount of variables and interactions in play it will be 
impossible to determine exactly who was impacted in what way a species that technologically progresses like ours will over 
have a larger impact on its environment regardless of what economical paradigm is dominant capitalism is very good at 
large amounts of stuff we do not really need so i do think it is reasonable to think that 
might amplify our impact on our climate more than other ideologies amiga three thousand here in the netherlands we 
having discussions about by how much not if we should increase our countermeasures against the projected rising sea level 
is a direct economical impact of climate change wealth is being drawn upwards into the hands of corporations and 
super rich faster than it is being created as long as this keeps happening the people who have less 
continue getting poorer no matter how hard they work there are people who could change this but we must 
of them as bad actors any discussion of economics or politics that fails to acknowledge this serves their interests 
wealth is being drawn upwards into the hands of corporations the very rich and those who serve them faster 
it is being created this means that there will be less and less available to the bottom half of 
population no matter how hard they work there are people who could change this but who choose instead to 
suppress wages and working conditions these people are bad actors any discussion of economics or politics that fails to 
this serves their interests is it resolved that minimum wage hikes lose jobs economist jacob vigdor claims otherwise i 
no idea how to prove or disprove his research but love to hear arguments why it is or not 
httpswwwecontalkorgjacobvigdorontheseattleminimumwage an absolutely fascinating podcast i think interesting how intellectuals will choose not to indict the severity of the 
crisis i have no choice but to deduce that this is because they maintain an interest in preserving the 
of the ultra rich i have no such interest and it strikes me as sycophantic whenever i encounter it 
appreciate sean for trying to bring naidu around at the end but then again i see him pushing for 
to unite against inequity and the associated problems worth checking out philip mirowski on markets as computing systems available
