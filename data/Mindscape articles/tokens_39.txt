sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll all heard stories of families 
in small towns where the children grow up and make different decisions some of them wanna go to the 
city and test their fortunes others wanna stay behind and live a comfortable life within the traditions where their 
grew up this kind of difference between moving to the city and living out in the country or even 
suburbs is increasingly becoming a major partisan divide both in the united states and worldwide as will wilkinson puts 
in a recent paper he wrote are no republican cities anymore in the united states republicans live in suburbs 
the country democrats live in urban sc wilkinson is a vice president for policy research at the niskanen center 
washington dc and dug into this question in a paper he wrote called the density divide urbanization polarization and 
backlash not just that people who go to the big cities become liberal and people who stay in the 
become conservative interesting cause and effect relationships what kind of people move to the city what kind of people 
the city and move to the country what do changing demographics immigration and birth rates and so forth what 
do they have on how people think about the world not just who they vote for but their outlook 
life their outlook on other countries their outlook on the economy sc this difference between city life and suburban 
country life is increasingly becoming the important difference between different kinds of people here and elsewhere and so important 
dig into how happening and why it is so go music sc will wilkinson welcome to the mindscape podcast 
wilkinson thanks for having me on sean sc so written quite a wonderfully interesting research paper about the density 
which i wanna focus on for the podcast but first just to get our listeners oriented as to where 
are why you say a little bit about who you are what perspective coming from and also give you 
chance to plug the niskanen center which is a recent new appearer on the scene ww great well i 
will wilkinson i am the vice president for research at the niskanen center in washington dc you pronounced it 
in finnish a finnish last name but the guy we named it after pronounced it niskanen so the niskanen 
sc some of my best friends are finnish so i do learn a little bit yeah ww yeah the 
of my best friends are line huh chuckle yeah and what we do at the niskanen center a think 
we focus mostly on climate and energy immigration welfare and economic and social policy as well as a few 
areas regulation and so forth and been around about four years and we started as a moderate libertarian institution 
of the senior staff at niskanen are expats from the cato institute which we all left for various reasons 
we have over the course of the last three years or so been trying to find our niche and 
less and less ideological and more and more pragmatic and just consider ourselves a moderate think tank but we 
to have a free markety sort of focus but not in a traditional right of center way we are 
fans of social insurance and the welfare state one of our themes is how capitalism and the welfare state 
well together sc so for those who know the cato institute is i take it slightly more straightforwardly ideological 
the sense of being procapitalism libertarian kind of place ww yes it is got a very orthodox version of 
that people may be familiar with if read ayn rand or robert nozick or murray rothbard it some diversity 
views at the cato institute but a narrow band within a pretty orthodox libertarian perspective and a lot of 
at niskanen who used to work there left because we grew out of it in one way or another 
to see that we were making certain errors one of the nice things about arguing for a living is 
you end up encountering people who are smarter than you chuckle sc yeah ww and you can never accept 
you lost an argument in the moment but afterwards when opening the fridge to make a sandwich at two 
the morning and thinking about it and just like really something wrong with my and as you try to 
it out you try to cover the chinks in your armour you try to shore up your position and 
the time you figure out how to fortify your general position you find that given up something that you 
been standing on before and as you iterate that process you just actually end up with a pretty comprehensively 
set of views over time but because it seems gradual you really notice it necessarily right away sc yeah 
is not what here to talk about but very happy to talk about it awesome the idea of a 
transition in physics which is very similar to this and i was always skeptical of things like the backfire 
where you say that you give someone some piece of evidence against their position and they hold their position 
strongly sure true sometimes but clearly a timescale question here presumably when they do those psychology tests asking the 
right away and underneath the surface these little thoughts and facts percolate and then a long time later there 
suddenly be like crap i gotta change my mind about you might even forget where the initial impetus came 
ww yeah sometimes i think the funny thing psychologically is i know if the same for other people i 
a little bit weird but i tend to initially resist the idea that i have changed my sc oh 
ww when i have and i think that has something to do with holding the narrative around your selfidentity 
in a way so a resistance to even acknowledging that you changed your mind you just tend to interpret 
in terms of i really change my mind so much as i changed the emphasis on this point and 
view that i have now is just a better way to articulate what i thought all a lot rationalizing 
goes into telling yourself what you think but after a while you start to notice that no straightforwardly contradicting 
i used to sc the very first episode of the mindscape podcast was with carol tavris who wrote a 
book called mistakes were made but not by me all about how we rationalize every single thing we do 
right just continuing our sense of identity is a big part of it so but anyway okay good i 
we could talk about this for an hour but we have other things other fish to fry and so 
this paper written actually let me finish the thought of the niskanen center because i think that a lot 
things gonna end up saying are gonna seem to the outside observer like slightly critical of republicans or of 
people more generally but have you been a republican most of your life is that a fair statement ww 
to say that been on the right for most of my life sc yeah okay ww because i have 
a professional libertarian for most of my professional life i went to grad school got some grad degrees in 
and out of that i started working at the cato institute also worked at a place called the marketo 
which is part of the large network of organizations that are run by the cokes or by the coke 
i voted for republicans before but in most presidential elections i think when i was younger i voted for 
but i voted for mitt romney on identity politics grounds i grew up a sorta mormon and that sc 
ww my people mitt romney chuckle i think i might have voted for george w bush over gore not 
see this is one of those sc your self image has repressed that ww i honestly remember or i 
have voted for whoever the libertarian candidate was i remember favoring george w bush over kerry but i know 
i actually voted for it might have been the libertarian but yeah so most of my professional life been 
some way a part of the right and the libertarian movement is part of this right of center coalition 
was initially forged around anticommunism libertarians were always the socially liberal part the most socially liberal part of the 
coalition tend to be in favor of drug legalization and the decriminalization of sex work tend to be antiwar 
so a lot of commonalities with people on the left and in fact one of the reasons why i 
up leaving the cato institute is that my colleague brink lindsey and i had both decided that we were 
you know what people call right fusionism and the fusion of social conservatism and more libertarian economic views at 
cato institute as libertarians we would often say that we have just as much in common with people on 
left as on the right but institutionally and just as a matter of the practical political reality hanging out 
republicans and those are the people helping so like make good on this thing that we and so we 
a project where we were reaching out to people who worked at think tanks on the left of center 
leading magazines and journals of ideas and building a kind of left fusionist libertarianism that for a while we 
liberaltarianism which is a terrible name sc i remember those days yes i was paying attention to that ww 
that was going okay and then the tea party came along and a lot of people at the cato 
got super excited about it and thought it was the president at cato at the time had believed that 
was something essentially libertarian in the american political culture and that this strand of our cultural dna would someday 
up and there would be this great efflorescence of populous libertarianism he thought that teaparty was his moment and 
stuff that brink and i were saying was a bit critical of the tea party and all of a 
our concentration on building this coalition with democrats seemed counterproductive and so we had a bit of tension and 
parting of the ways over that but for the most part seen myself as part of the right and 
we do at the niskanen center mostly though not publicly visible is we go down on the hill we 
with moderate republicans on our issue priorities ww and the trump presidency has been a horror show for us 
main goals are things like getting republicans to support a carbon tax getting something like comprehensive immigration reform passed 
like that chuckle and trump has not been very friendly to those efforts and the republican party under trump 
friendly to those efforts but that is where most of our time goes that we and this i guess 
to the point of my paper the genesis of my paper we like most everyone had expected hilary clinton 
win the election and we thought that our comparative advantage was gonna be bringing along some moderate republican votes 
support things like legislation on climate change comprehensive immigration reform and things like that and gonna need some republican 
to get through we were building the kind of network of allies on the hill that would be able 
make that happen and then trump won the election and we were like laughter and like a lot of 
i was like the heck like gone screwy or missing something ww and at just a bit before that 
the big brexit vote in the uk and starting to see these uprisings of the populist right in europe 
elsewhere and it seemed like a general thing that was going on and the explanations that i was hearing 
account for it that satisfying to me like a backlash to neoliberalism or a backlash to political correctness or 
change in immigration there was a lot in all of those things that makes some sense but it seemed 
bigger than that and more general so i started digging into the kind of question with an orientation to 
and understand where rightleaning populism was coming from why nationalism was all of a sudden a thing again it 
out that history end laughter sc never quite taken it by that one yeah ww yeah and so i 
like so happening and so the genesis of this paper was trying to understand basically why trump won the 
but also why brexit was happening why populist nationalist parties keep winning more and more vote share in even 
most liberal european countries and i hit on a couple of things that i thought had been overlooked so 
dug into them in this paper sc well especially interesting to me because finding this a year plus into 
podcast that certain themes keep reappearing even though i talk to very different people about very different things so 
idea of cities and urbanization as a major driver of the future of the world is absolutely one of 
i talked with jeffrey west who talked about how innovation and creativity are driven by high density populations and 
talked to joe walston about how this optimistic future where we can save the planet by getting everyone into 
and preserving the environment outside and now saying that in some sense major political trends worldwide and in the 
states especially have a lot to do with urbanization as a phenomenon ww yeah right so the thing that 
got me started is after and it was jonathan rodden at stanford especially published some things about the relationship 
population density and party vote share and stuff i thought was just mindblowing that this very tight almost linear 
between higher density higher democratic vote share lower density higher republican vote share if you go to the densest 
of any town in the country and then start walking towards the edge of town it just if at 
middle of the town at the densest part the most democratic part and if you just kinda walk toward 
country it just gets progressively less democratic and then the less dense it gets the less democratic it gets 
more republican it gets that struck me as crazy like how could that be the case and then the 
thing which relates to an interest that had for a long time in political psychology in my grad so 
was a phd student in philosophy and i studied stuff at the intersection of political philosophy and cognitive science 
i have long been interested in what explains why people have the moral temperamentsdispositions that they do why people 
the kind of political impulses that they have ww so i was aware of all of these literatures that 
personality types to different political attitudes and so i was looking at those pictures of the relationship between population 
and party vote share and just mapping that on to what i knew about the relationship between partisan loyalty 
leftright ideology and personality and i was thinking if both of those things are true this means that there 
to that that gradation along density from less democratic to more republican has to be a gradation in terms 
personality as and i was like that be the and i got really interested in that and the paper 
to take shape out of that like how did we get this kind of division in our politics it 
to reflect a real spatial division in where left and rightleaning people end up living sc yeah the personality 
i think is especially fascinating in fact i listened to your paper i listened to the you did an 
book reading of it which i thought was fantastic because now if you ever have a viral tweet you 
actually say to my soundcloud and listen to my reading of this chuckle but also it induced me even 
take the big five test online so we can talk about sc oh great sc later on but before 
ww i can guess you sean been doing this so much sc when we do that when we get 
there i want you to guess me i guessed myself four out of five i would say but just 
the size of the effect that talking about here it really is remarkable before we get to explaining it 
pithy summary is that you say in the paper there are no republican cities which when you put it 
way sounds kind of dramatic and not only that but it used to be the case right this is 
relatively recent phenomenon but extremely strong now ww yeah it used to be the case so in the paper 
go through three different mechanisms of sorting maybe i should back up a second and just mention the overarching 
of urbanization that is one of the things that i felt was being overlooked in a lot of explanations 
i was seeing for just a lot of social developments broadly if you look at it urbanization is clearly 
most momentous thing happened in human social life over the past two hundred years this just absolutely immense transformative 
the entire human population has basically filtered itself out we used to be really diffusely spread out over the 
when we had agricultural economies that sprinkles people around in a relatively uniform sort of way but the end 
the agricultural economy the beginning of industrialization led to this slow shift of the population towards these big concentrated 
of commerce and trade and that is a worldwide phenomenon just absolutely immense ww and a lot of people 
how big the effect is in one thousand seven hundred ninety when the constitution was written and new york 
had people in it and about the size of my hometown which i talk about in my paper in 
iowa which is just a bit less than but now we have just scores of cities that metro areas 
are over a million people and all over the world just populations are continuing to concentrate more and more 
more and that fact has to really mean something gonna make a difference to the way people are relating 
each other and then thinking about that one of the things that immediately came to mind was thomas work 
segregation which may or may not be familiar to you sc i wrote about it in my book the 
picture ww you did awesome do you wanna explain it because i can sc no no no this is 
here for you to explain it but a way of explaining segregation even when people have only mildly pro 
by my own in group kind of attitudes right ww yeah exactly schelling and if a big influence on 
i love thomas schelling an economist at harvard he won the nobel prize for his work in game theory 
got this terrific book called micromotives and macrobehavior is that what called and the whole point of the book 
to show how you get aggregate effects out of individual choices and got a very very simple elegant model 
you could do it on the checker board if you want you can take the white pieces and the 
pieces and just distribute them on squares randomly and the rule is that each of the pieces wants imagining 
of the squares as like a house and so there are eight squares that touch any square unless at 
edge right the up down left right and both diagonals and the constraint is ww nobody minds being in 
minority fine to be in the minority you just want three of those eight squares to be the same 
white or black as you and so what you have to do is you have to move each piece 
it satisfies that constraint but man so you do it over and over again if you move one then 
opens up a new space and it violates the condition for some other piece and as you get them 
situated you find that pretty radically segregated the board and so even this mild preference for homophily as the 
scientists call it homophily is just liking sameness and that seems to be a pretty deep feature of human 
that everybody likes people like them our friends tend to be people like us interesting friends even tend to 
the same height they are and stuff like that so you see homophily in all sorts of different things 
so an assumption of sort of uniform weak homophily and even sc i talked to nicholas christakis on a 
podcast and he labels it ingroup ingroup or something like that one something that he says just appears all 
the place in the animal kingdom whenever social structures become to exist at all ww yeah absolutely and so 
you look at experiment with just his little model and tons of people have done all sorts of elaborations 
this and you can watch them on youtube with like you can set up a population of millions of 
and blues or whatever you want them to be and you can change the constraints but if you use 
it can take if got a huge population it could take millions of rounds but over time those populations 
fairly cleanly not just in half but get these very clear clusters of reds and blues that are sharply 
from one another but those assumptions again are weak weak ingroup preference and you can change those assumptions and 
can say like suppose the whites and the blacks on your checkerboard have slightly different preferences and one of 
has stronger ingroup preferences than the and you can mess around with it and get even sharper segregation ww 
i was thinking about that in the context of this massive glacial shift of populations from the country to 
city if there is even small differences and this is what i think schelling is telling you like even 
the same in terms of wanting to be near members of their ingroup if differences in the nature of 
groups can make a big difference ww so this is one of the first cut in my paper on 
terms of what predicts urbanization is just ethnicity right so almost the entire nonwhite population has sorted itself into 
and that is explained largely by ingroup preference everybody likes to be around people like them and especially if 
are a minority who has who is discriminated against who has a history of oppression gonna want some safety 
numbers and so gonna have to coordinate on a place to be if you just scatter a minority around 
territory of a country at random gonna be isolated and scary right so they tend to gravitate toward cities 
much any minority and it have to be an ethnic minority gays and lesbians are very very heavily concentrated 
cities and other kinds of minorities are as well and a lot of reasons for that but a clear 
that you see and not that africanamericans or hispanics or asians have more ingroup bias than anybody else that 
same on average but in order to satisfy even a weak preference for being around people like them all 
have to basically go to the same place sc because there are fewer of them yeah ww the other 
of them there is no real option if a person of color you might prefer to live in a 
place a lowdensity place but no way to satisfy the preference of being around people like you and living 
a rural place for the most part if an ethnic minority so you have to give up on one 
those two things and most people who would have whose residential preferences lean more in the direction of low 
if an ethnic minority they just generally give up on living in the country and end up living in 
slightly pastoral suburb or something like that in a place close enough to other members of their group but 
the white majority in the united states easy if you really like to live around other white people and 
like urban density in luck you can live basically anywhere not a city is almost entirely white ww and 
is kind of the crux of a lot of the thinking in my paper where just like are there 
one of the things that then so if you first pass as ethnicity nonwhite ethnicity sort into city some 
people sort into cities but others and if trying to explain why the republican party is the way it 
and the republican party is almost entirely composed of white people who sorted into cities then an interesting question 
if there are systematic differences between the white people who sorted into cities and the white people who sc 
also before we get there there is this issue of sorting in the sense of picking up and going 
versus just choosing not to leave right i mean how many of the white people who are outside the 
started inside a city and said this is not for me gonna move out to the ww you know 
know the number but surpassingly small just given the overall trend of urbanization so just a huge percentage of 
are toward higher density and one of the most important facts about urbanization that means that almost all mobility 
from lower to higher density not always the case been a big shift of populations within big urban areas 
suburbs are gaining population faster than the denser cores and some of that is because housing prices and some 
of what it means is that a lot of but there are a lot of people who are getting 
out of urban cores since are moving from higher density to slightly lower density suburbs but those suburbs are 
urban and so not a lot of movement so there is some movement from higher to lower density but 
very little movement overall in the aggregate from metro areas to rural areas or from the city from the 
of a city to the fringe excerpts you just see a lot of that ww there are places like 
places that are gaining population a lot of them are people who are from cities moving to the country 
they tend to be in the recreational rural category so people who are buying a country home or moving 
a ski resort or you love to hike and mountain bike and so you move out into to some 
spot outside boulder or something like that so some rural growth in those areas that involve people moving from 
to those places but the overall ww but very roughly speaking yeah we have sort of whites who want 
be in the city moving to the city and minorities also moving to the city and then whites who 
be in the city just staying put where they are ww yeah so a lot of staying put but 
also the trend of urbanization is so strong that still a lot of movement in any case but where 
stop is gonna reflect these differences among individuals that determine what kind of place they like to live in 
the incentive to urbanize is so strong that even people who are resistant to cities still gonna earn more 
the city if you wanna capitalize on the wage bonus to higher education hard to do if you move 
a large labor market ww so i live in iowa most of the time my wife is a professor 
the university of iowa and a lot of students here i grew up in a smaller town in iowa 
if you wanna if you go to a public university and you get a degree and you want to 
economically from that training and that increase in your skills you just go back to i go back to 
iowa and make what i make as a think tank vice president in washington dc i lucky that i 
also live in iowa city iowa but sc sorry i think this is worth digging into a little bit 
because i grew up in the and the where cities were just thought of as vast oceans of poverty 
crime and correct me if wrong but cities still have a lot of poverty in them not just rural 
but there are a lot more inequality in cities very wealthy people a healthy middleclass and poor people in 
whereas a little bit more homogeneity in the rural areas and homogeneity at an overall level of lower income 
you might find in a city is that a fair if ww oh yeah absolutely cities have a massive 
of inequality where poverty is very heavily concentrated and there are a lot of reasons for that ed glaser 
some great stuff on why cities are better for poor people and why particularly attractive if you have less 
but cities are increasingly productive as some of the podcasts that done are these efficiencies increasing efficiencies from the 
density from agglomeration as the economists call it and that is increasing the wage bonus to urbanization so got 
two things happening at once you got a wage bonus from higher education increasing because of technological change as 
changes it affect productivity equally ww you need to have a higher and higher level of education to have 
productivity amplified by the new communication and information technology and we educating people fast enough to keep up with 
so a rising bonus to getting higher education and to higher levels of education and that is amplified by 
independent not independent but related thing happening in cities where something about the knowledge economy and the information economy 
paul romer the economist is another noble prize winner who has done great work on how growth is increasingly 
function of just coming up with new ideas ww the ideas drive growth and that idea production really seems 
be higher when you concentrate a lot of really really smart people together a professor at one of the 
universities and kind of obvious when at a caltech or something like that that more productive there than you 
be somewhere else because you have all these incredibly smart people that you interact with every day and that 
you up ww i like to play pickup basketball and you become a better basketball player if you play 
better players and just what it is for a large part so two aspects of that increase in productivity 
concentration is that if a coder and you are around other great coders you learn a lot from them 
a kind of competitive pressure that pushes your level up but not where most growth comes from most growth 
from just these marginal increases in individual productivity it comes from these bigger ideas that lead to innovations that 
productivity in a way that scales across huge parts of the population and so those ideas tend to get 
more quickly when you get smart people together kinda shooting the breeze and so an increasing concentration of economic 
in cities and that makes them as i say in the paper more magnetic right a good way to 
about urbanization is that over time you know cities are like magnets and the incentives to urbanization are like 
level of magnetic attraction and like an electromagnet you keep turning it up and the pull keeps getting stronger 
stronger and as that cluster of people gets bigger and bigger it turns up the magnet again and again 
again which is why the whole population is filtering toward the cities unless you are not a very magnetic 
of person ww as i say in the the paper if you imagined it as ball bearings just distributed 
the table with a magnet in the middle and the ball bearings are made out of all sorts of 
metals all the magnetic metals are gonna get drawn toward the magnet eventually but if aluminum or a plastic 
bearing or something just gonna basically sit where you were the entire time and i think something like that 
on in the way urbanization has been working some of us are less magnetic than others and so despite 
very strong just dynamic just happening drawing millions and millions of people towards cities some people are just less 
to filter in and my conjecture which i think there is some basis in is that the things that 
people less likely to urbanize are also things that predict more rightleaning political views sc very fond of the 
analogies here on the mindscape podcast so we approve of that but yeah so what we wanna get into 
fact and it affects the environment and it affects the knowledge economy and everything but it also sorts right 
affect everyone equally and political leanings are one of those but you also talk a lot about personality types 
the big five and is it maybe causally that comes before the political leaning ww yeah i think so 
about the extent to which personality is a independent variable the extent to which is exogenous of political opinions 
the question is maybe does moving to a city make you a more liberal personality type does living in 
country make you more conservative sc or education right ww or education so the trait among the big five 
are most politically relevant are openness to experience and conscientiousness these predict whether more liberal or conservative in your 
views sc tell us what all five of them are we might not know ww a good mnemonic is 
openness to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism neuroticism often called emotional stability if you kind of flip the 
of it most of those have no relationship to political views but openness and conscientiousness have pretty significant relationships 
do you wanna guess what my results were ww you so all academics are relatively high openness sc yeah 
open yeah ww high openness got a podcast about discussing ideas sc i know ww that illustrates what openness 
so openness is curiosity is a large part of it it involves just interest in new things so if 
in openness more interested in reading the new novel interested in the cool new movie interested in traveling to 
you been before and encountering other cultures encountering people who like you interested in trying new cuisines things like 
and that correlates the strongest correlate of liberalism or conservative or high openness people tend to be more liberal 
openness people tend to be more conservative the other trait that has a significant relationship is conscientiousness and conscientiousness 
the getting it done personality trait you know highly conscientious people keep lists meet deadlines they just generally have 
shit together what conscientiousness is so it might not be clear how that relates politically high conscientious people tend 
be more conservative low conscientious people tend to be more liberal the conservatism of conscientiousness is involved one thing 
conscientious people really dislike is uncertainty a conscientious people want there to be a clear relationship between effort and 
or inputs and outputs the a student personality trait hermione granger you wanna know what you need to do 
get the thing sc yeah ww and so what do i have to do to get the grade so 
conscientious students are the ones who badger you after class about what exactly the syllabus means because they gotta 
sc wanting the world to be just ww yeah yeah and the low conscientiousness people like me chuckle who 
lists just are amazed if they ever make a deadline are much more tolerant of this kind of uncertainty 
inflexibility and so an inflexibility in conscientiousness and there tends be a slight fear of just a strong desire 
stability they just wanna know how everything works so they can hit their marks sc i was very low 
neuroticism and completely middleoftheroad on conscientiousness extraversion and agreeableness but interesting to me this both conservatives and liberals get 
good quality that they correlate strongly with right most people would probably say being conscientious is good being open 
good the normal valance that those terms have ww yeah sc but is i take it that because supposed 
be useful dimensions in fivedimensional personality space there must be people who are high conscientiousness and high openness and 
in each right and they have an obvious place to fit ww absolutely yeah like the way these traits 
not exactly that real things but the traits come out of a factor analysis where trying to figure out 
minimal set of traits that correlate very strongly with one another right so the whole idea is that independent 
each other and so higher openness and conscientious just swing completely freely of one another the academic personality type 
very high openness relatively high conscientiousness like academics tend to be a students right sc yeah ww hard to 
a professor to get through that much school if you turn papers in on time sc right ww and 
conscientiousness people struggle with that but conscientiousness is the best trait to have in terms of predicting success in 
and in your career so higher conscientiousness people are more likely to finish school more likely to finish anything 
they start it and high conscientiousness predicts higher salaries highly conscientious people tend to be a little more productive 
make you wanna do anything a kind of auxiliary or kind of workhorse trait but openness has more motivational 
to it so if high openness it makes you attracted to certain kinds of things so conscientiousness is the 
that makes you good at school openness is the trait that makes you want to learn sc right ww 
those are relatively independent of one another a sad finding that i reported in the paper from shelly lundberg 
economist at santa barbara i think which is the that generally conscientiousness predicts academic performance but it actually for 
socioeconomic status students wanna think that the working hard and getting stuff done dimension would predict academic success for 
wealthy black students for example but it but it turns out that openness does right and i think a 
example where you seeing the motivational aspect of openness that if less privileged and the deck is stacked against 
the thing that really pulls you through is just the desire to learn sc interesting yeah ww and so 
traits interesting and one of the one of the reasons why i fixed on the big five is there 
other personality theories that are specifically intended to explain political views and moral views like jonathan moral foundations theory 
some of those are a little bit problematic hard sometimes not so clear that that if i identify as 
conservative that that just affect my answers on sc yeah ww the moral foundations quiz but the big five 
to explain your politics and it explains lots of other things and has replicates really really well and helps 
all manner of behavior and one of the things that i found interesting about it because high openness weakly 
your inclination to go to college at sc mmhmm ww even though it mean that be good at it 
makes you wanna go to school and if you go to school and get a college degree that amps 
your magnetic attraction to cities because where gonna benefit from your degree but sc and presumably even if not 
the idea that if you did grow up in a rural environment the chances that you would pick up 
and move to a scary diverse pluralistic urban environment are probably much greater if you score high on openness 
yeah absolutely and one of the most important aspects of the set of correlations that openness and conscientiousness have 
other stuff so both openness low openness and high conscientiousness relate to a broad set of traits that you 
just call ethnocentrism or ingroup bias and so people who are lower openness tend to be more ethnocentric their 
of homophily the strength of their preferences for sameness are stronger and so lower openness people are more put 
by difference and diversity and so if lower openness gonna make you less interested in and maybe averse to 
where there are a lot of people who are unlike you and very very interesting and especially since in 
context of of someone like donald trump doing everything he can to elicit sense of ethnocentric solidarity so higher 
people as i said before are interested in people who like them interested in other cultures interested in other 
so if higher in openness just gonna find the urban diversity more attractive and if low in openness gonna 
it unsettling so important just in and of itself but then and this is one of the things that 
found most interesting is that lower openness also just predicts your inclination to migrate at all sc yeah ww 
higher openness and it makes sense when you start thinking about how it relates to an interest in novelty 
difference lower openness people are less likely to want to move and less likely to actually move higher openness 
are way more likely to wanna go somewhere new which is one of the reasons why higher openness people 
i wanna be careful about not making it sound like openness is great and low openness is terrible sc 
ww because lower openness people are just better friends chuckle sc they stick with their group ww they stick 
their group right your low openness friend is the guy gonna show up at three in the morning and 
you out of jail sc yeah ww right like if your lowest openness kid is the one gonna call 
when old sc yeah be there for you sure right yeah ww sc i have two i know this 
not really systematic data but it helps make all these points vivid to me one was driving someone around 
older person who sure would score in low openness driving around my neighborhood here in la and seeing all 
these signs on the storefronts many which are in spanish some of which are in asian languages and they 
said that bother and like the food is much better here because of all this kind of diversity we 
it just struck me that i even have thought that that should bother me sc and on the other 
of the valence side i knew a guy who had been in the army his whole life and he 
and he immediately got a job as a security guard and explaining why he mentioned the fact that he 
to wear a uniform every day and again that never would have occurred to me as a good thing 
i get it that it is a good thing and i kind of like the label openness for that 
it sort of biases us towards instantly thinking that openness is good but there are absolutely values i think 
having different restaurants with different ethnicities is an unambiguous good thing but i get the idea that there are 
who just want to keep things simple uniform doing the same thing every day so they have space to 
about other things not intrinsically a personal failing ww no not at all and that and i so if 
overall hypothesis is right in that over time the higher openness people are more likely to migrate and therefore 
because migration is mostly urbanizing migration and lower openness people are gonna be more resistant or less sensitive to 
incentives that drive people to urbanize over time the less dense populations the rural populations should become lower and 
openness like that is an implication of the view and as the magnetism of cities ramps up it will 
to pick people off who are on the margin each of these traits is normally distributed and so people 
are on the low tail of openness are least most likely to be rooted to put down stakes to 
incredibly loyal to their community to family to the people around them not gonna wanna give up on that 
most people are in the middle by definition and as you move down the bell curve as the magnetism 
the city ramps up it starts picking people off further and further down the bell curve but that leaves 
average in a lot of these places in higher like lower openness sc it shifts yeah right ww and 
will tend to give an increasingly conservative ethnocentric cast to a lot of these places i wanted to mention 
openness and conscientiousness predict predict social and sorry social liberalism and social conservatism things like abortion samesex marriage immigration 
towards race but it relate at all to economic views that those relate in any systematic way to any 
the personality stuff so just these social views so if over time the sorting dynamic of urbanization is leaving 
places increasingly low in openness also getting higher in ethnocentrism ww and then on top of that you have 
effects of the thing driving people to the city in the first place which is that that is where 
production increasingly happens so i draw heavily in the paper on work by enrico moretti talks about the great 
that there is this real divergence in our economy between a handful of extremely high productivity cities and everywhere 
everywhere else includes a bunch of other cities including rust belt cities that are in decline though not that 
the places that are in relative decline are not urban but almost all the places that are on the 
are urban and almost the entire lower density parts of the country are either stagnating economically or actually declining 
terms of economic welfare and so when you add an increasingly low openness high ethnocentric white population to this 
stagnation gonna get a lot of disgruntlement sc chuckle yeah ww and those populations as well the average level 
education is going down again because of the overall magnetism of cities to highly skilled highly educated people and 
is basically the reason the first order explanation for the great divergence that the increasing wage bonus to higher 
and the concentration of all the jobs where you get that wage bonus in big cities has filtered almost 
entire highly educated population out of the rest of the country and that leaves these other places at a 
kinda lower level of productivity sc i did wanna ask an economics question here seen various graphs that seem 
convincing that after the two thousand eight recession there was a comeback but the comeback went very strongly to 
who were doing well in the first place like the rich people are doing fine after the middle class 
doing okay and almost none of the gains went to people who were doing badly is there substructure there 
terms of rural versus urban did urban poor people come back more than rural ones or vice versa ww 
sure about the poor population specifically but urban populations bounce back much much much quicker than rural populations and 
is a big part of the story that those places do well an interesting like a little sidebar conscientiousness 
i said is the individual trait that most predicts just success in your career and conscientiousness conscientiousness make you 
likely to migrate but if you but it makes you more resolute in executing any preferences that you might 
have and so if the most conservative profile if low openness and high conscientiousness gonna really stick to not 
anywhere and so higher conscientiousness at the individual level means that gonna have a higher income ww but higher 
at the population level predict a higher level of productivity and i think that has to do with the 
that growth is an ideas thing and that also has to do with flexibility so a great paper about 
uk in terms of population level personality traits and the higher conscientiousness places bounce back from the recession as 
as the higher openness places and that seems to be because higher openness people are more flexible they like 
are we gonna deal with this the high conscientiousness people are the ones who wanna know what the rules 
but if the rules change they struggle sc and so high conscientiousness people can take advantage of opportunities but 
openness people are more likely to get the opportunities or go out and actively get them ww yeah and 
be the kind of people who explore the space of possibility and see how to adapt to the new 
so the creative personality type the most creative profile is mine as it happens like very high openness very 
conscientiousness that is associative and flexible but high conscientiousness low openness is you just wanna do the done thing 
if the world changes around you just incredibly confusing and i think super important not to be judgmental about 
sc sure ww just one of the things that writing this paper has done for me is actually made 
feel more empathetic toward trump voters to try to get inside what the mindset is of lower openness higher 
people the changes that our culture economy population is going through are truly unsettling if you have that kind 
mindset this is a high openness thing trying to get inside somebody head sc the paradox of openness ww 
paradox of openness but partly why higher openness people are have higher racial sympathy for example more likely to 
able to understand what it might mean to be a minority and have opportunities systematically denied to you in 
kind of structural ways whereas low openness people just get it they have a hard time understanding what other 
is like sc well just to make this ww not really interested sc yeah and just to make this 
clear i think that the picture that painting seems to come together in a view where a set of 
who live outside the cities who have been legitimately really damaged by the economy and at the same and 
for related reasons are ones who are naturally prone to be a little bit more skeptical of minorities and 
and foreigners and immigrants and things like that and it comes together and maybe this argument we had over 
trump won after he won was it because of economic anxiety or because of racism or nationalism these things 
all different aspects of the same underlying causation ww exactly and one of the things that i try to 
out that not really two separate explanations this big macroeconomic fact which urbanization really is it has to do 
the changing structure of the economy and the incentives that that gives people to resettle and that has these 
effects on who gets the benefits of economic growth if this dynamic is filtering the population in a way 
leaves lower density populations basically increasingly socially conservative but also depriving them of the benefits of growth not happening 
they live and not getting the full benefit of it that puts those people in a position where it 
very easy to sell them a narrative about why things seem so bad to them so if somebody like 
comes along and says are going shitty for you gonna make america great again which means make america like 
was when you felt sc or like you thought it was when you felt comfortable yes ww yeah exactly 
sort of nostalgic fantasy about what the past was like and the thing causing all these problems is all 
immigrants and these elites who live in cities who are selling you out to the chinese and giving your 
to mexicans and so on and so forth the kind of person who lives in those places is going 
be very prone to find that really persuasive and then the additional factor that i lay onto so most 
this explanation is and the overall story telling is about selection effects and some selection effects that have been 
think overlooked in the way that urbanization has segregated the population in this sort of schellinglike way but there 
these treatment effects right this large literature on how growth tends to be liberalizing ww that the further you 
from a sense of economic insecurity basically the more tolerant and open you are to difference and change and 
is really really well confirmed it feels to a lot of us like a oneway arrow to moral progress 
a liberalizing direction because economic prosperity or rising economic prosperity tends to make whole populations more culturally liberal you 
a transition from ronald inglehart is the big innovator in this area from what he calls survival values to 
values but you get that in a uniform way over an entire population when growth is increasingly economically concentrated 
cities so all of the already more liberal people in cities are experiencing the benefits of growth which tends 
make those populations even more liberal right ww a good example of that is the change in you know 
the past few years towards transgender people and the norms around it right so that rapid shift in norms 
acceptance of transgender people how important it is to use preferred pronouns to acknowledge their preferred gender identity textbook 
in selfexpression values but the kind of growth that makes people have increasing selfexpression values not going to these 
more conservative lower openness populations then getting even further polarization in terms of culture and values so to that 
not experiencing the same increase in prosperity and already more conservative they hear talk about using preferred pronoun and 
the hell is even ww there are i get emails from all of these conservative institutions and just all 
crazy right now about how we tell the difference between a man and a woman and i think that 
a really direct effect of the joint filtering of the population leaving the rural populations more conservative in terms 
disposition but also depriving them of the kind of treatment effects of growth that would make them a little 
more liberal intolerant just not getting it and so the urban rural cultures moral cultures and political cultures are 
growing further and further apart and to the extent that a kind of backlash i think driven by those 
effects where it just seems literally crazy to conservative people conservative white people in small towns to hear people 
about you just like choose your own gender it just seems absolutely it seems like the whole upside down 
for sc and so what is we quite yet talked about the role of education here i think this 
like the final piece of the puzzle that you talk about in the paper we have this side of 
rural people low on openness things are changing all around them been left behind by the economy those populations 
people in families from those regions might have their perspective shifted if they got more but i never know 
the causality is is it just the people who are more open in the first place tend to go 
college or people who go to college become a little more open ww very clearly both so the personality 
is not fixed the openness say is about the heritability goes at about the variation explained by genes is 
that but still that leaves a lot of room for change for differences that are environmentally determined and very 
that getting a college degree makes you more open traveling when young makes you more open so going to 
would increase openness and does increase social liberalism but also the case that if already more open more likely 
wanna go to college and i think one thing that people have overlooked which is clear to me having 
up in iowa and living in iowa city where there are a bunch of students from rural areas people 
especially high openness urban people tend to overlook the extent to which going to college is a form of 
that is uncomfortable to really rooted socially temperamentally socially conservative types going to college means moving away from your 
it means moving away from your friends and a huge attrition rate from freshman laughter not coming back for 
sophomore year and i think and some of it is just like a bad fit ww and if from 
small iowa rural town and you come to the university of iowa way more diverse than any place ever 
it does it seems like a wild big city to you and if those rural populations are becoming more 
over time i think their parents are find it less attractive to send their kids as well like it 
true that sending your kid to college is gonna make them a little bit more liberal but like it 
means sending them away from you you wanna do that like you love them you want them to go 
and you especially want them to go away to a place gonna make them even more different from you 
that if they get a college degree gonna have to move even further away from you and to this 
scary big city that is dangerous and full of weird languages and smells and food like unappealing and so 
think some of the rightwing reaction against universities currently has to do with some of this just very deep 
discomfort a feeling that somehow like leftwing propaganda that is making their children different from them chuckle but i 
a kind of rationalization and the deeper thing sc but ww not wanting to be separated from your loved 
sc yeah and which i was gonna say totally understandable in some way we do live in a society 
the idea that families live together in the same neighborhood over generations is more or less disappearing in most 
our population ww yeah absolutely and a real loss sc yep ww a real loss of rootedness these lower 
places tend to be higher be in a social capital kinds of places like when people stick around they 
each other better they tend to be more deeply invested in churches in the lions club and the rotary 
all of these civil society institutions those places have a rich informal really tightly woven together social life which 
has a lot of advantages a really nice way to live if you fit that kind of place like 
for a certain kind of person but everybody have to live the same kind of life but that kind 
life is becoming less and less feasible becoming less economically feasible and it feels if lived in one of 
places it feels like the world is trying to destroy everything important to you and worth taking that seriously 
yeah you briefly mentioned churches but you talk about religion a lot in the paper is this even be 
urbanization there is just the whole idea of modernization and the strong attachments we have to community to family 
churches are weakening with time and probably the increasing secularization of the country in the world is something that 
both significant and very bothersome to the low openness people who are out there in the rural districts ww 
absolutely the secularization is one of those things it tends to go along with rising selfexpression values so religious 
tends to fall as gdp per capita increases as people get more and more wealthy what selfexpression values mean 
that what tends to dominate your interest is being myself finding the thing that fits and consumer culture is 
play into that and not really what the idea of religion is sc yeah usually ww yeah so people 
are high in selfexpression values are gonna be really annoyed that the catholic church change its views on birth 
or on samesex marriage like with it but not what religions are for one of the interesting things about 
united states is one of the reasons it i think maintains a higher level of religious participation than a 
of european countries is that it has this history of really entrepreneurial religious activity when i i lived in 
for a couple of years and this his name joel a big tv pastor and got the old basketball 
as his church it fits fifteen thousand people and i went to it a couple of times just fascinated 
it again another high openness thing i wanna see what the low openness people do right sc yeah ww 
barely a religion like he said just this prosperity gospel stuff but and so really heavily customized to what 
certain kind of person wants to hear and that keeps people coming to church about how if you have 
and try to look good like you buy a car nicer than you can afford and then god will 
you afford it you know sc positive feedback yeah ww and but that keeps people going to church adaptive 
a way that catholicism but it also just rinses the actual religious content out of it and i think 
has a lot to do with evangelical support for trump a certain kind of person but the actual content 
their religious convictions evangelicalism is basically americanism with a light christian gloss on it and it more political than 
is religious more about being against abortion and being in favor of american exceptionalism than it really is about 
the lessons of christ in your personal life activity not and i wanna paint with too broad a brush 
are deeply devoted evangelicals who spend all their time helping people in need but also just a very vulgar 
version of it that really about anything other than the expression of a suite of rightleaning views of the 
sc well it can seem very weird bizarre to outsiders that people whose selfidentity is so centered around their 
and religiosity are fervent supporters of donald trump for a whole bunch of different reasons so maybe the diagnosis 
on the table i wanna sort of move on to prescriptions in a couple ways unless you think that 
anything that you wanted to say about the overall picture painting ww no no i think we got most 
it in sc yeah i think that two big things looming in my mind here one is you make 
point that people like to do these maps of the united states and who voted red and who voted 
and especially if you do it at the county level the blue counties are very very tiny and in 
sense because just painting by acreage right ww mmhmm sc yes absolutely true that most of the acres most 
the land area in the united states voted for donald trump but most of the people voted for hillary 
and they also most of the people voted for democratic senate candidates but they win and you make the 
point that a vast majority of the gdp voted for hillary clinton right ww excellent sc much greater economic 
in the blue regions than there are in the red ones but furthermore the trends are all in the 
of increasing representation for those blue areas in various reasons so it paints a picture where the republican party 
about conservative versus liberal as ideological designations but as an institution the republican party is taking advantage of certain 
really democratic features of our republican government the senate the supreme court the electoral college but that go on 
and are we facing at some point a tipping point as we started talking in the conversation about a 
point where the republican party just collapses and it gets of the vote share and is in the wilderness 
years ww we think a lot about that at the niskanen center one of our big projects is trying 
restore a moderate elements to the republican party the more the kinda rockefeller republican type of moderation and it 
seem extremely unstable but but i think at a really dangerous moment as well so as you said a 
of people know about the after the two thousand twelve election the gop did this analysis about what we 
to do to win and their overall consensus was that we need to just increase nonwhite vote share and 
we can do that we can hang on with big national majorities indefinitely there was a lot of talk 
how george w bush got like of the hispanic vote ww if the republican party can do that consistently 
because there is this baked in lowdensity bias in our entire electoral system so if we have what calling 
density divide in the less dense part of the density divide is systematically advantaged by the overall electoral structure 
our system then they can win they need majorities to win they just need to keep just chipping away 
democratic nonwhite vote share or even just by one or two points every cycle and they can just win 
right now that was the idea and the whole party apparatus bought into that and why in the last 
rubio cruz all these guys were in favor of comprehensive immigration reform that was part of this pivot but 
of sync with where the republican electoral base is and there was a twenty dollars bill laying on the 
that trump picked up that this increasingly ethnocentric lower density population experiencing economic stagnation kind of cultural vertigo like 
want more immigration and so he just doubled down on this kind of nativism which has shrunk the electoral 
so now almost exclusively white almost exclusively exurban and rural and they keep winning with that coalition ww so 
two options which is either to do what they were gonna do in two thousand twelve and start chipping 
the advantage with nonwhite voters or they can cheat basically and it looks for all the world a very 
investment in cheating sc in cheating yeah ww and that is super dangerous and very very bad news so 
knows about the russian interference in the election everybody knows about how the gop is doing nothing about securing 
elections at all how the supreme court has said that pretty radical partisan gerrymandering is okay and so the 
right now seems to be just doubling down on winning elections with a shrinking minority by disenfranchising democratic voters 
just straight up cheating and that really threatens the legitimacy of our democratic system in a way that could 
really destabilizing sc yeah and i do think well we actually talk as much as i wanted to about 
i think as the paradox of racism here in the sense that it seems weird at face value to 
that it was increasing racism that caused the white democratic candidate in two thousand sixteen to lose even though 
black democratic candidate won in two thousand four and or sorry i mean why would increasing racism have more 
effect when both of the candidates were white but there i think that there is an explanation there maybe 
could tease that out a little bit ww one of getting into more political alignment side one thing been 
over the past thirty years part of this overall sorting story is that the parties have just become better 
on a bunch of stuff and there used to be a lot of liberal republicans and conservative democrats and 
there are very few of them anymore so all the conservatives have gone into the republic party all the 
have gone into the democratic party but one thing really hard to get across to highly educated people who 
politics closely just how little most people pay any attention to politics at all and sc absolutely yeah ww 
little people know and so party alignment is first of all nobody lays out all their views my view 
the minimum wage my view on abortion my view on blah blah blah and oh let and then let 
check which party matches that better not how it works how it works is first what social identity is 
salient to you and more complicated for white people because being in the majority just being white so distinctive 
pretty clear for other groups right like black i wanna vote for the party gonna protect me against right 
so you learn that the democrats and then a democrat and then once a democrat then you adopt democratic 
about things same on the other side right so come to be that if a certain kind of white 
a democrat and if a certain kind of white person republican but people pay so little and this is 
found one of most depressing findings is that a big part of the flight of working class whites toward 
republican party really does seem to have been caused by barack obama being president sc just existing yeah ww 
existing a black democrat in the white house was a clear enough signal for people who generally tune in 
communicate that democrats are the party for black people who are for civil rights oh not for and so 
was a huge shift in whites with lower levels of education toward the republican party that really does seem 
have been generated simply by the fact the clarity of the cue that blackness sent sc but that seem 
explain people who shifted from being obama voters to being trump voters ww interesting it but i think there 
see that shift the interesting thing is you see that shift happening well before trump and so it was 
anyway largely sparked by just reaction to race and then you have trump eliciting these ethnocentric impulses that are 
common in that population so part of the sorting story also involves deunionization so the close connection between organized 
and the democratic party locked a lot of working class people into the democratic party kind of reflexively just 
of their identity a member of the flcio so i vote democratic but falling union participation just falling rates 
union membership have weakened those ties party loyalty is kinda sticky over generations ww just the fact that your 
are republican makes you way more likely to be republican and if your dad was a steel worker who 
a staunch union guy and democratic voter likely to identify that way too but but if not a member 
the union and that culture is just fading away where you live those connections become more and more tenuous 
then those people tend to start sorting more on these other identities a white person i like urban liberals 
like uppity black people in the white house like president and that kind of person if a guy like 
comes along and activates really encourages any ethnocentric impulse that you might have i think that can instigate a 
shift but i think it was happening before him he just heightened the dynamic sc yeah just a little 
to me but okay just put a conclusion on this thought about the future of the republican party because 
think i totally would have bought that strategy that you outlined for republicans in that if we can just 
some nonwhite people to be in our there are africanamericans asians latinos who are low on openness strong social 
profamily and a coalition of urban people of that form rural whites and high education high income whites who 
want tax cuts that could potentially be a winning party but not the direction they went in but on 
other hand we have a system of government that really really favors having two political parties with almost equal 
of winning right so putting aside the disaster scenario where we just have some sort of nationalist coup and 
rid of our representative democracy entirely not quite seeing how gonna reach that new equilibrium where republicans do start 
out in the posttrump era to maintain actually of the demographic ww yeah currently kind of locked in partly 
the way trump has remade the gop what parties do is determined by political scientists call it the policy 
in the coalition and at this point so strengthened the nativist nationalist wing of the party that one of 
big demands of the party is keeping the party a party of rural white people an understanding that broadening 
coalition bringing in a higher percentage of nonwhite voters kinda digging in right now the divide geographically is around 
thousand people per square mile if the republicans just pushed in a little bit inside the outer suburbs they 
pick up more than enough to keep winning ww but that means picking up some more higher education voters 
means picking up more nonwhite voters and if you get those people in your coalition then those demands matter 
and if what you wanna do is just shut down the borders and basically interested in stopping demographic change 
gonna be able cater to those voters right and so you wanna keep them out because gonna get in 
way of what you wanna do and so just kind of stuck and i think the only way they 
at this point is there needs to be a catastrophic electoral defeat so my fingers are crossed for just 
gigantic democratic victory in two thousand twenty because that will at least force the party to consider whether it 
keep going as a ethnonationalist party of rural white people and will create some opportunities for others to come 
and say the idea that we had before was a good and to push toward the moderation of the 
party but the integrity of the entire political system really depends on there being a responsible governing right ww 
is bound to change hands over time and you need two parties in a twoparty system that will actually 
to govern instead of what the gop under trump is trying to do which is basically destroy the system 
keep itself in power how places collapse into banana republics and so really really important that they face a 
catastrophe in order to force that change sc yeah i agree more i would love to be back in 
world where it was not obvious to me which party to vote for i would much rather have a 
healthier vibrant opposition party even if i vote for them i want them to be good and always hard 
tell when a party changes in one direction is that the beginning of a trend that will last toward 
future or is it just the last gasp of certain parts of the party so have to see be 
very interesting as you say fingers crossed the other thing i wanted to close on is like you said 
you did the research for the paper it does make you more empathetic with the rural voters who you 
trying to understand better and even if they gave into some bad impulses with respect to nationalism or ethnocentrism 
on board with the idea that the system has failed them their economic situation is not very good and 
prospects are not very good i think that donald trump is fixing things very well but how should we 
things how can we organize given the fact that technology is changing the world very rapidly that urbanization is 
how can we carve out space for economic and social success for people who just wanna live in rural 
and have a lifestyle more or less similar to what their families have had for the last couple of 
ww yeah i think an incredibly important question one of the perverse things about the gop currently is that 
has very very little interest in actually aiding its own base i wrote a piece for the times a 
of months ago which showed the relationship between economic stagnation and just republican areas the hamilton project at the 
institution did a study on economic vitality and so they have an economic vitality index and the huge majority 
counties in the united states that are way under water in terms of economic vitality are staunchly republican places 
density rural small town areas but the republican ideology free market antiwelfare state ideology basically gets in the way 
them doing anything at all to mitigate the slide going on economically among their own voters which does create 
opportunity for populist democrats i think both bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have their fingers on the opportunity there 
really see what it is and what needs to be done really is we need to improve our social 
system we need to make sure that people have access to healthcare the united states is one of the 
countries in the world in which there are some major the white population has declining life expectancy and there 
is genuine desperate economic insecurity in a lot of places ww the opioid epidemic i think reflects a lot 
the selfmedication around the anxiety of the loss of jobs the loss of economic vitality in a lot of 
where people live so at niskanen we have a project called the struggling regions initiative which is a whole 
of policies that are intended to help bolster largely lower density rural areas not just rural areas but places 
doing so well because only until very very recently that even the economics profession has got its head around 
fact that inequality is increasingly a regional thing that a big geographic aspect to the way our changing and 
not gonna be a way to we reverse the trends but we can mitigate the damage through just social 
but also a lot of things that we can do to improve the atmosphere for development and growth in 
lot of these more rural states that we currently doing ww so a lot of good ideas that can 
pursued but just really hard a lot of people are just gonna have to recognize the fact that a 
of small towns have no function they have a reason to be the reason there are all of these 
here in iowa just peppered all throughout the countryside and that has to do with the fact that agricultural 
required getting people into these fields all over the place but agricultural employment has collapsed and these little towns 
hubs of education where you could buy milk at a store and housing but nobody needs jobs in those 
anymore there are no jobs in these place anymore sc right leaving ww just automated combines plowing through the 
very little need for agricultural employment so really little need for these towns at all and those populations a 
of them we just have to recognize that we have to basically put them on life support there are 
people in these towns never coming back and they just need help we just need to help them and 
the decline of these places as comfortable as we can while at the same time trying to do our 
to promote development in the places that the people from those small towns are moving to so all the 
in the more rural states like here in ww des moines is doing really really well here in iowa 
and cedar rapids doing really really well ames is doing really really well these places with universities with big 
centers these hubs of employment and innovation activity there can be a lot more done to promote the health 
growth in these places and to build these kind of miniagglomerations that will be selfsustaining over time but they 
need subsidy they need a boost from the government in order to get on the track where gonna be 
places for people to live and and you can staunch some of the flow of your educated population moving 
other states if you do have attractive places with good jobs for them to work but a lot of 
that has to be done to make that possible sc yeah we should have said this earlier when we 
about urbanization not talking about new york and los angeles exclusively right places like des moines and ames absolutely 
and a huge benefit in terms of cost of living to living in places like this so there can 
a very vibrant and diverse set of urban environments throughout the country in some sort of future equilibrium sc 
we need to do a lot we can do a lot to build up these midsize cities they do 
an economic function they can be very very productive but the way things are structured now we are effectively 
the trend of hyperconcentration in a few big cities and we need to be subsidizing that in the way 
we have been strangely been moving in the other direction a huge problem in terms of housing costs in 
big megacities and that actually mitigates the problem of concentration a little bit that effectively redirects people toward smaller 
and so actually helpful in an unintended way but we pay a big economic price for that workers are 
productive in these smaller secondary hubs but a lot to be said for making these smaller secondary hubs for 
them up to the point where the difference in productivity as large as it is now so that people 
a bigger menu of options in terms of urbanization sc a wonderful corrective the whole conversation because we talk 
much these days about the internet and being online and connectivity and forget about the fact that where you 
live still has a huge effect on how you live who you talk to how you think about the 
ww it absolutely does and one of the puzzles about agglomeration efficiencies the technologies that have increased the bonus 
density are also the technologies that make it seem like you ought to be able to work from anywhere 
do work in washington dc from iowa most of the time possible technologically but it turns out that hard 
before we started we had a technological problem right difficult to communicate over these distances even with the technology 
as someone who works remotely i can really feel it mammals hypersocial mammals and by myself in my basement 
i feel lonely and disconnected from the people that i work with and i start to be like am 
even doing blah blah but when in the office in washington dc i have this sense of bonhomie and 
and like do this right and just a real effect of getting mammals physically close to each other and 
like a team doing and i just think you can replicate it ww i think ever replicate it through 
we can maybe asymptotically approach it through virtual reality or whatever low latency versions of communications technologies but i 
think any replacement for actually being able to touch somebody and smell them subconsciously like animals and an impulse 
a lot of the tech sector to see us as more abstract and less embodied than we really are 
i think that actually leads people to make serious mistakes in understanding how economies actually work sc yeah all 
technology out there in the world does not change the fact that we are mammals absolutely right alright will 
thanks so much for being on the podcast this was a fascinating talk ww it was great talking to 
sean thanks so much music another terrific episode chockfull of interesting ideas and eg survival values vis a vis 
values i hope to further research this ronald inglehart thanks guys excellent work sean i live in the country 
frankly cities scare me a bit here we all help each other especially in winter in the cities people 
make eye contact sean is possibly the best podcaster ever on things sciencey however when he veers into political 
social areas his lack of depth and subtlety come to the fore unfortunately while he and his guest are 
open and up front about their biases they still manage to sound like hilary talking about her occasionally they 
veer into solid discussion about real differences but for much of the time they sounded like two teenagers who 
taken a personality test the test told them that they were smart attractive and open like most tests of 
kind and that they were far better than people not like them they then spent extended periods talking about 
cool and attractive they were all the time doing their best to not disparage the poor unfortunates who were 
and closed minded and ugly well what the test said they were phrases like that anything wrong with peppered 
conversation when they were discussing the poor unfortunates unlucky enough to not be like them the cool ones i 
on except to say that this is exactly why you got trump and why he will win bigly next 
i was a bit confused with mr thesis if i correctly summarize it this way people high in conscientiousness 
and seek people like themselves which they find in lowdensity areas people high in openness like and seek novelty 
which they find in highdensity urban areas but minorities of and immigrants among them do want to be among 
who are which they find in urban areas this behavior of people low in openness although in the case 
the immigrant by definition that person sought novelty and risked a lot to be in that city and for 
rest of minority groups their openness and noveltyseeking at least in some make them want to venture into the 
rural life i wonder if the fact that that group move away from the big cities is a sign 
their own high conscientiousness and low openness seems like model is too narrow and tries to explain too much 
only one variable initially the wilkinson actually had the conversation going in a good direction but then i think 
kind of carried it away from what his paper was actually about and more into a circle jerk about 
trump was elected and the dangers to his election ironically enough this is when wilkinson gets exposed imo it 
like wilkinson has some data behind what he is saying but that using confirmation bias to kind of take 
data and run with it through interpretation at one point sean even pointed out how his arguments are contradictory 
there were a bunch of people who voted obama and then trump he answered this by saying the trend 
before obama but that really make much sense if it was racial the trend that did start before trump 
the outsider people forget obama was the outsider before integrating into the establishment so what happened a stronger outside 
the election of trump trump is now reforming the republican establishment this is a republican establishment many like carroll 
wilkinson hated btw now they praise that establishment that has been reformed ironic these conversations really need someone protrump 
on them because there is such a bubble with both the host and guest here the fact that they 
take it for granted that trump is pushing ethnonationalism shows how deluded and outoftouch they really are trump has 
advocated ethnonationalism he advocates nationalism which is a global strategy to get along with other countries global trade deals 
been designed in a way that helps corporations and harms workers trump is not an isolationist either a noninterventionist 
he wants lots of trade around the world he wants to be engaged trump also jewish children and grandchildren 
would not be allowed in a white ethnostate so why would he advocate for such many of his top 
and cabinet members are minorities as well this is not what you would expect from someone pushing an ethnostate 
truth is that trump won because he advocated policies that voters in key states believed in leftleaning worker first 
came through the midwest votes for policy over personality more than any other region and where trump dominated the 
trump was also very centrist in his policies shown by all the crossover votes of bernie voters voted for 
that matters in places like wisconsin where bernie dominated hillary i also encourage people to read comment because they 
a lot of key points my personal story with sean on twitter is that he blocked me for disagreement 
pushed debunked science that women were discriminated against in college and the workplace i showed that those studies where 
use names to try to prove discrimination are flawed have been debunked and actually more women are graduating at 
every level of education he blocked me for this in one podcast he laughed about how he blocks people 
willy nilly his blocking me made me feel quite bad i guess as long as his intolerance towards those 
disagrees with makes him feel good is all that matters right he even refuses to unblock me drafthobbyist but 
just because he read comments very much he has admitted this he blocks those who respectfully disagree with him 
his life on a university campus and refuses to read comments from those who could possibly disagree with him 
wonder why sean is so outoftouch on politics and has become so intolerant one last thing i forgot to 
white people generally speaking do not have a white identity if you ask a black person what their identity 
they will generally say black but ask a white person and they will either just say american or point 
their ethnicity this is shown through blacks voting almost entirely democratic while whites vote very split even while the 
party is openly attacking and blaming whites for almost everything the democratic party is also openly telling whites to 
silent and to step aside for minorities at school work etc this shows that blacks are acting far more 
than whites this tribalism harms them of course this go with the carrollwilkinson circle jerk the best episode it 
be worth clarifying what density is considered urban and how many people do you need to be a city 
these purposes to what extent are cities like galaxies which span a vast range of masses comments are closed
