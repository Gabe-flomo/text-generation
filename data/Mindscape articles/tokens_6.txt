you average per day valkhiya if the strong nuclear force is strong enough to hold together nuclei as heavy 
uranium despite electromagnetic repulsion between protons why there much heavier isotopes of light atoms say would a nucleus composed 
of neutrons be stable ezra parzybok what does a guy like you make per year jonny what do you 
of ideas like the dyson sphere and other giant structures like that do you think realistically it will ever 
possible to build anything even remotely similar in scale mitch lindgren hoping you can comment on eric theory of 
it actually means in terms a layperson can understand judith marsh in john book into gravity and he that 
we were floating in space between galaxies we see any light from other stars or galaxies really is the 
between galaxies so vast that it would be completely dark to our unaided eyes david lange physicists have used 
finely tuned optical lattice clocks one at the base and one on the observatory floor meters of tokyo skytree 
make new ultraprecise measurements of the time dilation effect predicted by theory of general relativity time runs slightly more 
at the base of the skytree tower than at the top only because only four hundred fifty meters tall 
it were significantly taller the top clock would dilate more because of the motion of the the earth is 
a name for height of tower at which the dilation from motion on the top level is equal to 
dilation from the gravity well on the ground level kirk briggs if the past and future are not as 
said much available to present exploration as the distant parts of then i see how you can justify that 
are equally real you consider yourself an eternalist but if the past always including now on some spacetime worldpoint 
what is eternal about your view greg griffiths what do recent indications that different generation process for type supernovae 
have differed in prevalence in the early universe and more recently the potential anisotropy in expansion imply for the 
constant measurement discrepancy or the contribution of dark energy jesse rimler recently you tweeted out a blog post by 
wolfram where he writes excitedly about a new way of conceiving the fundamental laws of physics i enjoyed his 
and i also took note of your wise words of caution about getting too excited my question is why 
a scientist of stature opt to post something for public consumption without submitting it to formal peerreview first peter 
consider a three dimensional object falling through the plane of a two dimensional world say a pencil falling pointfirst 
a two dimensional creature it would look like a point appearing out of nowhere then widening into a disc 
disappearing is this in any way analagous to quantum particles materializing and disappearing suggesting a source in a higher 
dimension richard moster since forces allow one object to influence another object and since entanglement allows one object to 
another object is there a way to express entanglement and forces in terms of one another or are they 
completely different mechanisms by which an object can influence another object john hamill discussed the idea that free will 
simply not being consistent unless they act in a really asocial and sociopathic a free will skeptic i think 
the wetmeat computer in my head attempts to calculate the outcomes of various decisions and that evolutionary influences and 
factors give me a preference for outcomes that benefit me and society is there any part of this perspective 
implies i should behave like a sociopath in order to be consistent sean k davis i can understand how 
curvature of space causes objects to follow a curved path around a center of mass such as the planets 
the sun what having trouble understanding is how the curvature of space imparts on those objects an acceleration towards 
center of mass what am i missing humberto nanni are the gravitational waves carrying oscillations in several directions transverse 
their path of propagation like the electro and magnetic fields that travel together in the electromagnetic wave john reynolds 
understand that relates mass to energy and that the speed of light is a factor what i understand is 
c is squared joseph tangredi my question has to do with can you define the word without referring to 
degree angles or similar concepts which seem to be humaninvented is there an a priori meaning of which arises 
from the fundamental laws of physics and which would apply for all succeeding spatial dimensions lineu d miziara how 
to discovering special relativity were lorentz and poincar√© how far beyond them did einstein go how was relativity of 
different from dan said that when you first encountered theorem it the kind of epiphanic moment for you that 
has been for some other physicists could you say more about this do you think discovery has been oversold 
mirabelli if i have two disjoint intervals on a world line how would i pick out a clock that 
reliably tell me if the two intervals have the same duration or tell me their duration ratios that is 
would i decide which recurrent processes are periodic doug c can you explain how dimensions in hilbert space relate 
the wave function and the measurement problem niraj dube confused by the different explanations given by physicists regarding what 
is made of is it purely a mathematicalgeometrical construct and therefore has no physical constituents or does it the 
of something physical such that it can be at the planck scale riverside i hear your point that unlikely 
of the manyworlds universe are proportionally less frequent than the likely ones still i do not see how this 
a conclusion that the manyworlds theory should not affect our everyday moral choices failing to conduct a regular technical 
of your car is a somewhat risky behaviour in the stochastic environment but it is an inevitable manslaughter in 
manyworlds universe someone will die as a result of this oversight in some however small portion of nearinfinite pool 
branching worlds zayitch kanzler listened to your higgs boson and beyond lectures and the something deeply hidden audiobook and 
hear come up as a pivotal solution to some nasty problems involving infinities wondering where do these infinities come 
why are they troublesome and how does renormalization pacify them dr paul meggs is there a short answer to 
simply having the wave function of the universe evolving according to the schroedinger equation lead directly and unambiguously to 
everettian manyworlds daniel fox my son just recently heard of eric gravity unification theory since the subject is rearing 
ugly head again can you please just briefly explain your opinion of it deepthi amarasuriya when we speak of 
occurrences eg specific fundamental forces separating out ten s after the big bang what are we referring to given 
time intervals are not absolute brendan hall do you have any personal interest in your heritage some seem to 
learning about their own genealogy while others see their family history as less meaningful or totally irrelevant joshua hillerup 
you had to learn new to you areas of mathematics since you stopped being a student and if you 
how do you prefer going about learning those areas brent meeker i notice you tend to avoid the problem 
branching by assuming there are an almost infinite number of indistinguishable prior to a measurement so the measurement is 
a splitting of worlds this is much more plausible than saying a measurement creates two branches but a creates 
thousand but it seems that the born rule is still just and axiom and there is no mechanism within 
schroedinger equation to produce this splitting and so no description of exactly when the split develops p walder stephen 
theory shows the graph separating seeming to imply the existence of two separate universes would the disconnected pieces of 
graph appear as black holes due to the event horizon justin bailey gravity is typically illustrated by for example 
a bowling ball on a flat sheet and talking about how the sheet is depressed but space is threedimensional 
is there a better visualization for gravity than the classic bowling ball on a rubber sheet stefan bernegger why 
you so sceptic about initiative is it the process channels he has chosen or is there something fundamentally flawed 
the idea rudym do you think that some of the answers concerning the nature of consciousness can be partially 
within the realm of quantum mechanics in physics simon carter i am really enjoying your biggest ideas in the 
series what study do you do before each episode or is it the case that you know all the 
subjects off the top of your head ricardo razera could you explain an experiment that would test manyworlds vs 
in qm benjamin feddersen a thought experiment an observer is inside a satellite no windows in orbit around a 
well in the room is a computer terminal connected to a main tower outside the room by a say 
minecraft when the observer begins to play they notice the framerate is lagging abnormally would there be any way 
that observer to tell whether the lag is caused by the main tower being lowered into the gravity well 
being subjected to time dilation or rather by another person in the room next door trying to run another 
of the program at the same time if not would this represent another equivalence principle similar to the equivalence

your thoughts on the tension between individual rights and economic growth versus public health that seeing play out throughout

murray dunn at some point in a podcast you mentioned working on an ipad pro would you talk a 
about what programs you use your work flow and how you organize ipad your work and any tips or 
for recording equations ben resnick assuming manyworlds and the timesymmetry of the laws of physics it always a possibility 
remote that a world could evolve to its previous state and given that all worlds that could exist do 
that there will always be a world which appears to evolve backwards in time in comparison with our own 
or any particular world for that matter paul hardie heard it said that the big bang was the beginning 
time but also our universe might be part of a multiverse or a pocket universe or arose from something 
so time have to exist for that earlier thing to be around confused crabby smales two months back you 
issue with correlating low physical entropy with low algorithmic information content do you see no positive relation even when 
between microstates the relation i was trying to draw was between compressibility of microdescriptions and entropy low entropy macrostates 
tightly constrain and thus provide more information about the possible microstates the unusual highentropy microstates compatible with evolution to 
medium entropy present require stating in detail at high information cost to a model however we can effectively specify 
microstates that happen to be low entropy simply by giving the macrostate sigurd enghoff is it conceivable that the 
could have started in a higher entropy state if so how might the early universe have appeared and have 
differently martin czigler in your interview with pro poker player liv boeree you discussed playing game theoretic optimal have

my cat is walking on the slow side of the room drifting towards the slow side of the room 
when i try to push away from the slow side i drift right on back like some intuitions for 
time anomalies cause acceleration intuitions that are more physically intuitive than magically move themselves to maximize their proper if 
particle has a wave function that distributes its location evenly over a large area then i interact with it 
it to take a real position in my world does that mean that for every point on the wave 
other worlds also split off and have their own world with the particle found at every possible location jan 
is infinity a useful abstract concept that helps with mathematical concepts only or is infinity actually a reality in 
natural world can time for example be infinite raymond abernethy could you explain what quantum error correction entails suraj 
just finished the book and i have been relistening to the last two chapters over and over there is 
much jampacked in there i am still struggling to understand what you mean by of in chapter is this 
or a euphemism for something more fundamental sandro stucki my question is about when macroscopic objects cause decoherence how 
a quantum system like a photon or an electron remain in a coherent superposition while interacting with a macroscopic 
such as a beam splitter or a screen with a double slit but not when interacting with the measurement 
or an observer or the environment why the quantum state decohere with overwhelming probably when it hits the beam 
causing us to observe behavior instead of interference george sharabidze multiple questions picked one in your work meter with 
you state that the universe expands the density of of particles does it mean that along side with density 
volume of the particles are affected too and consequently wave function and of the particles dmytro shevchenko immanuel kant 
believed that space and time as we know them are a priori notions in our minds that allow us 
perceive the world a posteriori according to transcendental idealism we have access to the nature of space and time 
we possibly know empirically whether they actually exist years later do we now have reasons to believe we will 
to know what space and time really are truepath peter gerdes so i often hear discussions about the arrow 
time talking about the need to explain the fact that there was a low entropy time in the universe 
entropy is only defined relative to a choice of macroscopic observables has there been any work that tries to 
what fraction of the possible initial conditions would result in a low entropy state relative to some notion of 
observables creatures in that world might have sklogw in deeply among other things you propose that what we perceive 
physical proximity is an emergent phenomenon of entanglement experiments have shown that once entangled particles can be physically separated 
large distances and stay entangled how is that fact reconciled with the idea that entanglement causes us to perceive 
proximity mikhail korobko wojiech zurek in his of qm argues that although the universe as a whole is a 
wavefunction once we select one classical world as our observed branch no reason to treat other branches as equally 
in fact there is only this branch and the rest of the universe is simply in the mixed quantum 
such argument seems to avoid some philosophical problems of manyworlds where multiple persons exist in different branches while i 
that branching is in principle a matter of convenience why do you treat other branches as equally real anders 
lane craig insists that there exists an absolute reference frame view does this break anything in special and general 
or is it just an unnecessary assumption dan inch in the many worlds interpretation of qm certain events can 
the universe to split and branch off could anything make the worlds so that their futures are realigned clive 
assume two absolutely identical universes spring into existence at the exact same moment identical that is except for one 
difference biology emerges in universe a some eight billion years into the picture and continues for at least billions

why is beta decay paper regarded as one of the greatest contributions to century physics ian morgan how about 
a sort of and thing where you discuss the main theories being put forward for the unification of quantum 
classical physics i am a little confused about the status of string theory it has been knocking around for 
least thirty years now and although many physicists are working away like crazy at it there does not seem 
be any prospect of it ever replacing or being added to the existing model charlie morris can you give 
insight on free will an engineer and i live in a newtonian clockwork universe i think the direction that 
electron flows is only physics could you comment jack parkin during your conversation with kevin hand you guys talked 
about gibbs free energy would you be willing to talk a little more about importance to life spencer hargiss 
you think many worlds either in a quantum sense or an infinite universe sense have any implications for our 
of history for example the cuban missile crisis george faulkner the recent ny times obit on mathematician john conway 
to the will and its connection to the kochenspecker theorem related to quantum mechanics as a naturalist i accept 
and that humans or other creatures have such so i wonder if you can explain what is meant by 
use here or if maybe conway etc should have used different terminology less loaded with free will baggage fadi 
considering that the chances of the lhc finding evidence for supersymmetry are now pretty low and the prospects of 
a bigger particle collider are slim what are your present credences for string theory being the theory of everything 
what track do you think physics should follow in pursuit of the theory of everything stephan arlinghaus in the 
golden record took diverse portrays of the diversity of life and culture on earth to outer space together with 
on how the record is supposed to be understood by any life out there lucky enough to pick it 
imagine the human genome project was already completed back in i wonder whether it might have been a good 
to put the information on human dna onto the record thus sending the possibility to outer space that humans 
be reproduced and in some way may live far away in both time and space on alien worlds slim 
the chance of that may be paulina barren hi sean is there a question you would like to answer 
has never been asked i would love to hear about it alex jukimenko is there a way to have 
representationtransformation when potential energy and kinetic energy the same thomas prunty could you recommend a technical reference for decoherence 
it relates to many worlds not something you typically see in qm textbooks or classes gerard druiven i wonder 
i was a scientist but i am as large as an atom questions is could i detect the sun 
do not think i can see it with these bright little eyes gabor peter cser my question is about 
holes we know that general relativity is not applicable at the singularity i am aware of the holographic principle 
to which the information content is proportional to the surface of the event horizon instead of the volume of 
black hole can you imagine an experiment or observation that would result the lost of applicability not only at 
singularity but at the event horizon of a black hole gregory kusnick your bacon number via morgan freeman or 
fiatowner when i read steven three how should i think about those my understanding is that gravity affects so 
there something special given the extraordinary conditions that prevailed then doug eltoft would a theory of quantum gravity be 
to a theory of quantum spacetime john brady without asking you to do a lot of research and since 
project only official started on april just curious as to whether you have any first impressions on the wolfram 
project james kittock fascinated by the idea that according to our current understanding of the expansion of the universe 
will come a time when sentient observers in the merged milky wayandromeda galaxy be able to see anything in 
universe beyond their galaxy and the cmb will have cooled beyond detectability would those observers have any hope of 
the history of the universe as we understand it today jonas sr is the formalism that makes the equations 
the world look the same for all observers moving with constant speed with respect to each other is it 
to interpret gr in the same way ie as the formalism that makes the equations describing the world look 
same for all accelerated observers or is it something more than that needed to be assumed in gr in 
to tg hi sean when people refer to time passing more slowly close to a large gravitational mass how 
of that is due to being accelerated through curved spacetime vs just being in a curved spacetime gordon bamber 
question is about angular momentum spinning stars can collapse into millisecond neutron stars which are amazing objects but how 
if the collapse continues towards a black hole before the singularity is reached can the spin increase to the 
where the moves at the speed of light maksym aleksandrowicz according to many worlds interpretation everytime we choose diet 
over regular one the wave function colapses and since creating a whole perfectly balanced universe costs oh energy we 
responsible for creating a lot of other universes as far as i understand moving the real conciousness between those 
would require some new type of force in addition to the four we all know and love so it 
technically out of the question but since we created a lot of other well balanced universes populated with some 
characters they simply carry on as psychological zombies in a world without concious observer einars dear prof carroll does 
mwi basically say that everything allowed by the rules of nature of course is it not a bit paul 
really like to have some podcast recommendations from you science or anything else jeremy labrecque if a photon of 
x is traveling and encounters a photon of the same phase it results in constructive interference if that photon 
the same other photon half a wavelength further it will be out of phase with the other photon and 
result in destructive interference i thought that photons experience time because they travel at the speed of light but 
get two different outcomes when it encounters the same photon at two different positions what has changed about the 
in that period so that we get two different outcomes when interfering with the same photon jhon jack as 
graduate student that works on theoretical fluid dynamics i have always being a bit jealous of the attention fundamental 
gets with the public i have seen a lot of people and even qualified fundamental physicists that consider the 
of turbulence and other theoretical problems of fluid dynamics as a practical problem or a problem to be left

in space which continuously changes in heard the block universe model of time described as a music record just 
the past present and future are real the entire song exists on the record however we only experience a 
instant of time at a time just as the needle on a record only plays a single note of

eternal inflation theory tripp denison recently i started reading iain culture series because you often bring it up in 
about futuristic or conjectural sociology economics ai i was expecting a cerebral philosophical story but have been surprised by 
brutally violent the first novel is do you have opinions about violence in fiction and media antonio giustino i 
appreciate some help better understanding the fundamental qualities of space and space inflationexpansion which have always confused me space 
accelerates between the galaxies but not in a galaxy is that because gravity keeps the actual space fabric from 
or gravity keeps the particles in relative distance together while the fabric still expands george robinson the multiworlds version 
qm explains away some of the mystery of measurement but what does it say about the mystery of entanglement

one would it be an why paul hess in your katie mack interview you said that you believe there
