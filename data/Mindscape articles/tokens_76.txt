to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll now face it all contemplated how we would go about committing 
perfect murder or if any of you are truly innocents out there perhaps contemplated what it would be like 
be the victim of a perfect murder one way or the other perfect murders are the kinds of things 
dwell in our minds we wanna know what it would be like one of the things that we think 
true anyone who has watched tv or movies knows it is harder these days to commit the perfect murder 
it might have been in the past the ability of the police and their friends to investigate crimes is 
than it ever has been before in large part because of science because of our ability to do chemistry 
forensic science that teaches us something from the crime scene about what actually went down so what gonna talk 
today ray burks is an analytical chemist who moved from actually working in a crime lab to becoming a 
at st university in texas where she continues to work in forensics her lab constructs detectors that look for 
drugs and other substances of questionable repute to help the cops catch the bad guys sometimes science is asking

we talk about how the real world of forensic investigation differs from the version you see portrayed on csi 
how real chemists use their tools to help law enforcement agencies fight crime we may even touch on how

gonna talk about different types of poison if the way you wanna roll how to dispose of a body 
is a big problem for wouldbe murderers out there and also the major differences between what you watch on 
and the real world of a forensic investigator as far as i can tell the major difference involves paperwork 
hopefully this is gonna be an amusing listen usually in podcasts my goal is that something educational happens but 
quite sure i really want this one to be very educational stick with amusing shall we hopefully this will 
turn out to be useful in your own future planning i really want mindscape podcast to be investigated by 
fbi despite our best efforts though very possible gonna learn something as well as have a few thoughtprovoking ideas 
into your mind all right go music sc ray burks welcome to the mindscape podcast ray burks thank you 
so very excited gonna talk about chemistry and murder rb murder sc which came first for you the chemistry 
the murder rb murder sc murder came first rb murder sc that got you into the chemistry rb murder 
me into chemistry sc how did that happen rb so i wanted to be a lawyer and i was 
real dorky kid i used to go to the library on saturday carrying a briefcase that my parents got 
because they supported my dorkiness and i used to go and i used to read law books and learn 
collateral estoppel and so again really fun sc sexy stuff yeah rb i know very fun kid and then 
junior high i got an opportunity to go to a junior high trip and we went to washington dc 
of course if you wanna be a lawyer and a kid like sc like mecca yeah right rb but 
we had an opportunity to visit fbi field office and at the time they kind of had a tour 
a little bit of forensic science talking about crime and how science could be used for that and never 
before in my life thought science was remotely interesting or useful sc okay rb but this really did it 
me because i was just like you can use chuckle you can use science to do and i know 
it never really hit me before some people of course my age in this shuttle era would have been 
into space or dinosaurs and that never really got me but the forensic science that really resonated and then 
there i just went down the nerd rabbit hole sc because this was high school rb junior high sc 
high okay but then when you actually actively became interested in chemistry for its own sake rb yes because 
lot of the tests the idea that you know what something was and you could do some tests and 
out what it was that really got me sc right rb the solving mysteries and i think that kind 
what in a weird way being a bit of a law nerd when i was little and watching murder 
wrote with my grandmother and matlock and there was always some lawyer running around solving or some exhigh school 
who wrote mystery novels just up to no good chuckle rb and so seeing as science could solve these 
was really the hook that got me interested and then when i realized like so science is kind of 
big sc yeah and probably common but you stuck with the whole murder aspect rb yes sc i know 
your trajectory figure it out before i post the episode but you served you worked in some kind of 
enforcement capacity investigator rb yeah i was in a crime lab sc crime lab okay rb so chemistry and 
went to graduate school and then left graduate school and worked in a crime lab for a while and 
yeah what i thought i would do for the rest of my life was be in that line of 
sc so this is literally the csi stuff doing the i know what it you were doing you were 
compounds trying to figure out what it rb i worked at a small crime lab with just five people 
doing a lot of a little bit of everything sometimes you get called out to a crime scene but 
lot of times you just pulling case work that you get assigned you go down to evidence property you 
up the stuff sc yeah rb and you bring it back and you might be doing all kinds of 
i actually did a lot of forensic video and image analysis sc oh okay rb in addition to chemical 
and physical processing of prints again it was a very kind of and so you kind of had to 
and do certain things and then we also when we were called out to do crime scene work that 
something that you had to be requested to go out so and then it was usually some type of 
incident so it could have been a homicide it could have been say a robbery which you know a 
of violence or something of that nature that you would get called out and have to do kind of 
this crime scene work sc any particularly memorable incidents from that period of your life rb tons of memorable 
very few i could talk about chuckle sc very few you could talk about that is your law training 
know a little bit about what the rules are rb yes yes yes chuckle sc yes right rb so 
no for csi i and i knew this just from really being involved in going through education and everything 
that first of all in csi none of us are that good looking none of us have wardrobes that 
that hip or cool never had sunglasses that neat and i always used to watch those shows especially when 
was in that job and they never show them doing paperwork and i know i spent at least half 
time documenting and writing reports sc you think the show would be improved if there was more paperwork rb 
think the show would be improved yes csi paperwork laughter sc yeah csi paperwork rb but i think that 
the fun part is like so take all of that cut the episode by twenty minutes and put in 
writing sc more paperwork rb more paperwork sc that yeah sc i have no idea why not a showrunner 
a rb i know either sc there are some days when you might have yes so then what in 
world gave you the idea that what you really wanted to do was be a professor rb why i 
funny because i planned this whole thing where i was gonna work in the crime lab for a long 
and definitely when i was in graduate school you kind of sometimes are surrounded by folks that want to 
in academic and a little bit different in chemistry chemistry is also very in industry sc useful for things 
than being a professor rb oh sure sc not like theoretical physics chuckle rb i that was not me 
that was me rb but i think chemistry with history and applications the common thing is that a third 
in academia a third are kind of in government labs a third in industry so lots of applications in 
way and so actually most of the people that i went to graduate school with were not gonna be 
just chemistry sc right rb and a little bit different for other fields sc so this was your phd 
you had a phd before the crime lab yeah rb and so a lot of actually no i this 
what not to do kids i left graduate school to take this super awesome job because not that many 
and i said know what i will totally write my dissertation while working in a new fulltime sc oh 
last mistake rb so funny i mean i did but just say it took a little bit longer than 
had deluded myself and my advisor into thinking chuckle but yeah so i think most of the people and 
in my phd program in the lab that i was in a lot went into working at say glaxosmithkline 
merck a colleague that works at nist so a big mix academia is not the big deal sc yeah 
and so that was not uncommon and you planned for that in your programs a lot of people are 
into industry and chemistry or gonna be fulltime researchers but not professors not academics and so that was really 
to me because that certainly what i went to graduate school for but i learned a lot and i 
when you start doing a job then i realized i actually miss doing the research and because when active 
work you just have no time sc certainly not doing research no rb no i mean sc a lot 
paper work to care about rb a lot of paper work to be getting done but your case backlog 
some places can be several months if not years and so even though you might be best positioned to 
some new method you have no time or no resources in order to do that so i missed that 
i did miss teaching even though when you go to graduate school you really get a phd in teaching 
no rb or education sc no rb chuckle sc the more successful you are the less you teach rb 
so it was kind of funny to me and then going back into academia i realized that i did 
these and it kind of in a way snuck up on me it was not quite what i planned 
but i like the training aspect too of undergraduate research at a principally undergraduate institution so the idea of 
folks to do field work or lab work and really giving them the opportunity to develop new skills is 
an informative way is really fun i find very hard some days like i hope i am not messing 
up sc yup a lot of responsibility but chuckle rb but also a lot of fun to see people 
grow into their scholarship and into their profession sc so i do physics for a living some people have 
misimpression that this is somehow close to chemistry laughter sc in fact i know nothing about chemistry never even 
a chemistry class at the university level i took high school chemistry so if you if you had in 
that what you were interested in was sort of the forensic side of chemistry what kind of chemist would 
become i know physical and organic and inorganic and so forth rb yeah i would say analytical sc so 
does that mean rb so i like to call analytical chemists the detectives of chemistry so we tend not 
make chemicals we find them sc okay rb and we tend to find them in a sea of other 
so i always joke when people say really hard to find a needle in a that should actually be 
easy because a needle and a haystack are very different sc very different rb but analytical chemist about finding 
needle particular needle in a stack of needles sc yup rb and so while we often build or we 
a lot of synthesis we may build molecules or engineer instruments that will then be used as detective tools 
so i think that analysis and then also being able to look at the data and treat it in 
certain way whether statistically or modeling the data to then stand back and look at it what the hell 
it mean chuckle and really it is sometimes that way where you just you project it and you have 
thing and then you have to step back and look at it and it might be one of those 
where i know for sure this has happened to me where looking at the data you know it means 
and you bolt upright at am and it has come to you chuckle where seen this pattern before what 
pattern indicates and then you run to write it down sc well this is fascinating because i think that 
who are not chemists or scientists for a living might have a different idea of what it means to 
chemistry the process describing it sounds much more creative and artistic than a lot of people might think but 
when you say the pattern recognized the pattern a pattern in what what are you looking at rb so 
are so i build sensing devices and sometimes chemical sensors so one chemical will interact with another and give 
some signal and a lot of times a color it changes color sc okay rb or it fluoresces there 
be bioluminescence or some kind of luminescent event and so you might do something like trying to not only 
might have several of those sensors and then not just do you look at does it looking if one 
is in relationship to another is there some type of pattern in how certain sensors and then what does 
tell you about what interacting with oftentimes trying to design something to find at least for me being forensic 
to find bad stuff sc yeah rb weapons chemical biological explosives scheduled stuff so how then does the sensor 
because not enough to build it and have it be reliable and be like it always does it always 
red when in you also does it do that why does it turn red here but green and so 
you look at the data and you can use various tools and sometimes you use chemometrics which is like 
chemistry statistics chuckle as a way to again looking at changes of changes sometimes and you map the data 
sometimes look at a plot and i think even economic data lots of people who have all kinds of 
and you might plot it in a lot of different ways bar chart pie chart venn diagram like just 
a plot and then you know that something there and you just sometimes you just recognize the pattern or 
one thing influences another you just need to step back from it for a moment and literally it could 
literally i have literally projected things and literally just stepped and just gazed on it sc yeah rb and 
do feel like maybe that is a bit of the creative thing where sometimes gone to museums and pieces 
art and not sure that seeing what either quote you should or what maybe either the artist thought or 
seeing something that is not intended but you need to get a better look at it and sometimes you 
forward but sometimes been a few pieces and i remember the first time i went to the uffizi gallery 
saw say the allegory of spring or the birth of venus i had no idea they were that large 
ah you see photographs and all the same size rb you see little or or the mona lisa is 
small sc mona lisa i was just gonna say that rb and you just have to sometimes with the 
that like thing is the entire side of the and you are almost out in the hallway trying to 
see the full picture of all the data and what it means in relationship to other data and what 
we do in science is because you might have a very simple dataset this thing turns but then the 
sensors you add then you have seventeen of those things and then trying to detect one hundred different so 
of a sudden you have a very complicated pattern and you need to kinda step back and say what 
it all mean in relationship to each and so that part there is a creative aspect in how you 
it and i think sometimes i look at did that person paint that way with that or is that 
or did they sculpt it in that and and then maybe never know rb i do think that sometimes 
take stuff literally to their grave chuckle and they communicate the intention or anything and sometimes the point is 
take from it what you find important but you do sometimes from every angle have to step kind of 
and see can i interpret it in different and i feel the same thing with scientific data sc absolutely 
yeah rb different treatments and not as if making it up but you are doing again gonna make it 
bar chart versus a line graph and then what does that visualization reveal about the underlying process sc and 
thing about chemistry and crimefighting or whatever is that so many different ways that the chemicals are involved in 
investigation right rb yes sc say you are called out but you still get called out even now that 
professor now not a crime lab technician do you visit crime scenes rb no chuckle sc very sad about 
rb in a way not because a very stressful job and academia is stressful in different ways but also 
costbenefit i get to do other things now sc yeah okay alright pretend that not true laughter sc pretend 
get called out all the time rb okay sc what is on your mind when called out to a 
scene what are you gonna be looking for as a chemist what good is the chemist out there at 
murder investigation scene rb well i think it obviously depends on what kind of so typically when you would 
there you would get briefed by in charge of the scene which is not you laughter sc they remind 
of that laughter rb and no but when you watch on the tv like are the police laughter rb 
csi people are always running around but the background is important of what should we be looking for what 
be looking for missing is just as important as what maybe should be there and sc so what does 
mean missing rb well say that you had somebody that had a severe shellfish allergy and they and you 
that from family but yet not seeing you see an epipen you sc none of the drugs they might 
rb you even see a medic alert bracelet which is really odd sc the dog that bark yeah rb 
not there or if the person you hear from the me that someone was shot or somebody was stabbed 
they were strangled but literally no weapon around so not there can be just as important as what is 
and and the same thing goes with any kind of analytical data and sure in physics and astronomy at 
from friends that i have in those fields not only looking for present but what is not there can 
you a lot too sc so if someone is poisoned or something like that i could absolutely understand the 
of a chemist if shot or knifed is there still things for the chemist to do at the crime 
rb there might be and chemical tests though whether it would be a chemist there or not but sometimes 
might do a gunshot residue and so presumptive tests for that or they would actually collect swab hands very 
to what you get screened for testing at the airport and they might swab your hands and then they 
actually take that swab and secure it and transport it and then you maybe do some xray spectroscopy or 
type of atomic emission or absorption spectroscopy to see are the metal components that you would typically find in 
residue are they present and maybe at what so that would be some level of analytical but also say 
there is trying to say is this red brown stain is it blood or sc right okay what you 
use it for rb then you would do some type of chemical presumptive test or even so it is 
but is it and then you might do an immunoassay that would illuminate that sc so what does that 
exactly how do you how do you figure out whether blood is human or not rb certain antibodies for 
types of animals would be present or not present and you can do kind of like the same type 
technology as a pregnancy test sc okay rb to kind of really a dipstick it does look a lot 
you a lot of a pregnancy test and you can kind of get an idea and say which that 
lead you to another thing of is there dog blood here you know what i mean sc yeah no 
dead rb right that sc dog blood everywhere rb so i think another thing is that there are lots 
tests that folks do and so a lot of the even the presumptive and by presumptive test i mean 
just a quick screening test usually they change color really visual really fast to do and so sometimes real 
ones for scheduled drugs that will if you road side very popular like highway patrol or if screening something 
then you put a little sample in little baggie and break a couple of ampoules and boom purple sc 
rb right and sc so you not even a professional chemist like the cop on the street can do 
rb sure sc amateur chemistry rb and lot of those have been developed right and then a lot of 
behind that to get it down to it being that quote simple to do and so those types of 
are very popular and then can again just providing quick information to maybe make some type of a command 
and so chemistry chemical development of fingerprints so say on paper you can use ninhydrin which interacts with amino 
turns purplish pink color sc okay rb works like a charm on nonporous materials sc so you can get 
off of paper that way rb yeah visualize so stay on the material but you can visualize this print 
and that actually came about when folks were trying to do staining and chromatography of proteins and aminoacids and 
they were like this might be useful for this other sc you can solve murders with this yes rb 
many even ca cyanoacrylate or superglue fuming that you see a lot on tv that was a total oops 
rb we say that but very useful kind of technique and so a very interesting chemical process that people 
still talking about in literature about how exactly it works the mechanism sc so we know it works but 
chemistry the sort of individual chemistry is not completely understood rb we think pretty good sc pretty good okay 
but i feel like a lot we have really good mechanisms worked out or we think got very strong 
that this is this the action sc right rb until we sc yep rb chuckle and sc we do 
a better idea comes along yeah rb lots of and the fun when i think about say slime which 
seem unrelated the kids and adults face it love making with the glue and the borax love making slime 
just this year in chemical and engineering news people it was still in literature in real chemist still debating 
how that actually works and everyone thought that that was a for sure lock and you realize that no 
actually that actually this instead sc i think that you are more familiar with this process of slime making 
i am how do you make slime rb i okay sc i make slime rb well any of your 
that probably have kids have made it so you just basically get glue and you add in a little 
like a soap borax soap the powdered soap old school i know maybe in college in the labs they 
the borax soap and then you basically mix it together and it becomes this nonnewtonian fluid you would love 
i sc i would i wanna go home and get some glue rb yes super fun and of course 
can make it with different types of polymers clear glue white glue people put glitter in it and food 
and like bespoke slime but part of it too is even though that process was like know how it 
a polymer it crosspolymerizes blah blah blah out the then in the last couple of years people were like 
this discrete repeating crosspolymerization we thought it was and actually and so i find that really fun because even 
the best evidence at the time people were very confident explained a lot but then you get better techniques 
right and seen that definitely in forensic science where the trajectory of the field has changed the instruments get 
able to literally see either smaller amounts or levels of detail that change even small amounts can revolutionize an 
thought process sc would you say that chemical forensics is becoming more important over time in crime investigation or 
rb i definitely think more i think that the use of science in both criminal and civil matters has 
dramatically increased in the last i would definitely say in the last two hundred years and definitely in the 
and i kind of funny one of my shows as i grew up was murder she wrote kinda demonstrates 
you know that show was on i think for twelve years but when it was on you straddled the 
of predna and post and you see that in the show the things that they talk about in early 
and we can get fingerprints and abo and just laughter sc why would anyone do that yeah rb right 
then later a a sc they had dna yeah rb big revolution and then even watching shows columbo where 
a handgun take a handkerchief laughter from their pocket and think that somehow protecting the prints so take a 
and literally either the pen and stick it down the barrel of the gun to pick it up sc 
i know a bad idea rb right like all sc yeah destroying all the rifling rb yeah but i 
even that visualization you can see how even the perception and how shows are run now and now not 
to see whole shows where they show folks in tyveks and changing out their booties and got gloves that 
keep changing so seen the evolution of a field be mirrored in television and movies and sometimes right and 
artistic license taken but definitely the field is that reflects the big changes in the field which continue they 
with the technology sc sure and do the chemists get very involved with poisoning and things like that or 
that mostly medical people rb so yeah a medical examiner really depends on the state the difference between if 
testing of say tissues and biological fluids typically under the control of the medical examiner and then that person 
send tests out or request samples be processed by toxicology folks and maybe histology and pathology looking at different 
on like if is it tissue or is it say urine or is that kind of thing so different 
of materials and different types of tests but if you say you found some mysterious white powder that actually 
go to trace sc i see right so once in their body then maybe the medical job rb oh 
yeah that a different deal sc but when you find all sorts of chemicals around then the chemists get 
for sure rb yeah yeah and there was a big workplace poisoning case in germany this year where a 
allegedly is dozens of their coworkers and the last one that kind of kicked off them finding first of 
nobody had known this workplace poisoning was going on that spanned you know worked the company for forty years 
he was just killing people poisoning people rb potentially because this one worker brought their lunch you know in 
break room you put it in the fridge your biggest concern is you hope susan eat your wontons right 
right exactly rb and so they opened up their thing and they see this white powder that they sc 
laughter rb why is that on the sandwich right sc right yeah rb and so they took their supervisor 
at first was like some kind of a prank or and of course me being a chemist like not 
laughter rb not a prank sc mysterious white powder assume the worst rb and so they do some testing 
in the meantime they also installed cctv and it seems as if they did not maybe inform people that 
had installed cameras and so it turns out they got this person on video opening lunches sc just for 
rb and i think the thing that the investigation is gonna look into of what was going on there 
they do testing and they realized that it was lead acetate which is very sweettasting but incredibly dangerous but 
they go back and they realize he had so many different types of poisons poisons too that could have 
mimicked you especially these would be like a chronic poisoning not an acute so it might look like coworkers 
ill and at the time the person was arrested there was one coworker in a coma and one on 
sc so this poisoner was an aficionado he have just the bucket of bad stuff but he had a 
of different possible ways rb a lot there to unpack right laughter rb and then they started going back 
looking at how many coworkers of this person had died in the last twenty years and a i mean 
be a lot of work to do sc wow alright so chemists are gonna be fully employed by this 
yeah rb yes i think toxicology and then tons of stuff but i also think my chemistry background too 
in analytical image analysis and video which seems a bit odd but then how photography works how digital data 
and how things are stored and images in some ways an image is an image so if you have 
camera hooked up to a microscope versus a security camera how do those work what does the data mean 
do you retrieve the data and so i think just like in a lot of other fields where you 
translate the skills you learned to this maybe new application or looked a bit tangent you can do the 
thing definitely sc and not just figuring out how a murder was done or who did it presumably a 
of chemistry involved in things like finding the body or analyzing old cases and old rb oh yeah one 
i do wanna say is that i it was never my job to solve anything definitely a big thing 
job sc yeah okay laughter rb but you might say is this and the thing would be like or 
some data but i think yeah i think some of the most interesting stuff that comes out is trying 
find clandestine graves and how do you find when people have been moved or if people had been there 
so try to develop chemical tests and of course geologists do this a lot as far as types of 
and trying to look and even different life scientists of how different plant growths and then entomologists what kind 
bugs are there trying to locate those things and trying to map those you would even i sometimes am 
that a big problem that we have a lot of clandestine it turns out yes sc yeah really rb 
trying to sc so a clandestine grave this is not supposed to be a grave but a grave rb 
supposed to be a grave but yeah sc so a dead body in your yard and you tell when 
bought it rb yeah and actually in so in la now and just a case that happened where someone 
a decaying skull in their backyard sc as one does rb and then packed it up and brought it 
a police station and the police at this was just reported by la times i think it was yesterday 
the police were like thought it was a prank at first my thing is so if you find that 
it sc move it right rb and the police will come to your house laughter and take sc possible 
want the police to come to your house laughter rb right right and so i think the thing is 
those types of endeavors or when you have missing people and it could be historical i think also kind 
historical forensics where you might be trying to investigate a certain event and trying to really now that again 
advances and maybe we can start finding certain mass graves or certain sites things that people thought would occur 
sometimes there is a case that i wrote about for my column that was like renaissance era poisoning potentially 
was the rumor sc a long time ago rb oh yeah and the rumor was this was the court 
florence which was just a hotbed laughter sc there was a lot of poisoning yeah rb scandal and activity 
art and intrigue and all this stuff and there was this rumor that these folks philosophers and poets had 
poisoned and in an odd way or a good way i feel weird saying that but there are certain 
that just they stay with you they stay literally in the bone or in certain amounts they get preserved 
so it was really interesting work that they did because they had baselines say arsenic levels that everywhere a 
element sc arsenic yeah rb and it can be in drinking water it can just be around so there 
that really small baseline quantity and so it had that kind of environmental background of what was kind of 
present at the sc because arsenic is not some complicated molecule rb no an element sc element one atom 
and so they have that baseline and you can get that in a lot of ways we have a 
of artifacts from that period the stuff is just literally everywhere but then they did some interesting work where 
found that definitely for one of the two courtiers the amounts that then found were way beyond what they 
in kind of separate remains that just been more like this is pretty and again maybe then the leap 
saying was a malicious a legal law enforcement thing but when you look at the levels and you go 
and they were the medici orbit yeah rb now does that mean that a criminal again also talking about 
era where you and even much after that you could go to a pharmacychemist and pick up stuff that 
like sorry you could do laughter rb you could just go to the pharmacist and pick sc the rules 
looser back then rb strychnine and cyanide and so hard to say but the levels are interesting to be 
so someone needs to more about the reasonable explanation not just sc well we tell stories about the medicis 
kind of fun palace intrigue stuff but are we exaggerating or was there really that much poisoning going on 
i when you look back on those things people always say now like kids these days or and like 
rb there was some stuff going on between the borgias and the medicis and the stories that you hear 
then has that become almost integrated into historical lore and why sometimes the folks that go back and if 
look at the egyptian houses in upper and lower egypt what is that with great power comes great responsibility 
comes great responsibility rb i think with great power also comes great shenanigans laughter rb and just a lot 
potentially things that have gone on and part of it is i remember the first time i heard about 
borgias i was like and again we think that very modern some of these things sc no it goes 
rb oh yeah and i think that kind of the nicknames that things get like arsenic inheritance powder laughter 
how common it was and you sc could speed up your inheritance process a little bit rb when you 
about those things or hemlock and belladonna and strychnine and you think about all these things and how easy 
were to get and how uncle or whatever had a gastro distress and then it took a long time 
this is also an agatha christie device of sometimes it is artistic and sometimes art is just mirroring that 
soandso aunt whatever did have an eightmonthlong illness and then died and then soandso inherited the house or some 
bequeath but yeah but then a lot of times you look back at the old newspapers and you realize 
that is the sc a little suspicious rb the law and i always loved the oldschool law and order 
it or even in svu now it says that little previsal of is it may be similar because ripped 
the headlines and and you realize been doing that for a long time and some of these cases like 
a little too close to laughter sc well this is good switch gears from being the investigators to being 
perpetrators put ourselves in the mindsets of the perpetrators so we maybe working our way historically works here so 
you were back in ancient times what were the good ways to off your nemesis rb besides just bludgeoning 
sc yeah say we were a little more subtle maybe we wanna be caught rb yeah yeah yeah sc 
great thing about poison is at least presumably back in two thousand years ago if you bludgeoned someone pretty 
but maybe you could poison someone and no one would know rb yeah and i think that when you 
some of the classic quote oldschool poisonings been around for a long time your hemlock your belladonna sc so 
you presumably the trick is you want something that the person imbibing it know about rb know about it 
so not too strong a taste but of course how do you know it have too strong a taste 
wanna taste it rb well where the kind of folklore and and the other really interesting thing is when 
comes to poisons certain things again that people thing are kind of quote modern inventions poisons abortifactants birth control 
this has all been well documented in texts as soon as people could be writing down things they were 
writing down how to kill how to not get pregnant how to terminate a pregnancy or wait we need 
write down some laughter these types and bills of sale i think i think the historical folks would be 
no no bills of sales came those kind of tracking things but all of that when you look back 
some of our earliest great scientific texts and again at the time it was the best they could do 
read some of the things now and like would never have but there was a lot of information rb 
sometimes again it was observed that soandso ate this plant that was growing by the river and chuckle unfortunately 
so why that kind of information but poisons certain types of poisons have been known for a very long 
and people have been killing each other with poisons in one way or another whether literally chemical or biological 
and being intentional and trying to infect people people were flinging rotting corpses over walls and leaving dead rats 
water wells and trying to do different things and also just kind of bulk poisoning for a long long 
sc and one of the things you hear about is carrying poison not just through ingestion but through a 
or a weapon or something like that rb oh yeah sc how plausible are those devices rb pretty plausible 
folks know about curare and darts and arrows and things like that and also lots of greek mythology and 
plays will talk about a poisoned dress the poisoned dress trope is really popular of kind of saturating fabric 
having it and also a metaphor of having it be beautiful and then having it kill you and that 
covet it sc the person who wore the dress would be the victim of this rb yeah and or 
garment could be a dress could be a fancy garment could kinda reminds even the crowns so even game 
thrones a bit and there really a poison it was hot molten gold but you lust for something and 
covet it so sc a rb a symbolic element there sc aspect yeah rb but when you read some 
these plays like medea and you go and that again come from nowhere sc and what happened in medea 
so again the poisoned dress trope sc oh yeah rb where it kind of actually reads a bit like 
napalm and then when you think about open flames and and even flammable fabrics have always historically been a 
for ladies as far as the types of material dresses are made out of and the fact that they 
so much fabric for certain folks and that lighting devices were literally open flames sc right yeah everything was 
flame rb so this kind of danger of that and the visualization of that whole thing sc it looks 
when your dress catches on fire rb but even in a more artistic way to make a statement like 
game like that whole visualization but when you think about lots of routes of exposure ingestion gas like through 
skin and so a lot of methods and that also is interesting and historically it goes way back could 
been something that you would touch could again like clothes and you saw that the danger too like world 
i which is called the chemist war some of sc not really called that by anyone who is not 
chemist rb right sc chuckle sorry rb unless a historian unless that a historian maybe you call it the 
war but also some of the challenges with some of the earliest nerve agents and today is that they 
in the environment and on your clothes well if in a theater of war you really start running around 
all your clothes off even in a lab environment like lab safe been through lab training knows that if 
spill something on yourself you gotta to go use shower but actually supposed to take off this garment because 
is keeping it against yourself and so definitely based in history of fact again with some flair the ancient 
really did love their flair when it came to their tragedies sc they did they were good at it 
invented drama and tragedy right rb so yeah definitely rooted in sc do you think that it was an 
from early chemistry that desired to kill people in more creative and interesting ways rb i think finding out 
think funny because when you think about maybe the history of chemistry but in specific analytical chemistry was to 
currency talking about a time where currency or things that you could trade you had to prove they were 
chemical composition they were is it gold is it silver and for a long time salt was considered a 
and you could trade and barter it was so damn expensive and we think of it nowadays cause like 
cheap you can buy a bucket of it for like a dollar but is it what it actually is 
thing that attached huge value to and one big thing and then of course the other one is we 
find out why people keep why people keep dying sc yeah an important question rb and so i feel 
in analytical definitely this kind of trying to again solve mysteries of either this thing what we say it 
either gonna be the foundation of an entire economy which can cause an entire thing to collapse if the 
gold sc right rb or we have such a problem with proving goods are what they are which again 
a foundation of economy or again like the poisoning thing and deborah blum did a great job in her 
the handbook of tracking why that was such a thing because again in the foundation of the science society 
poisonings are were not that common and it was but the confidence and the security of society which is 
tenuous sc yeah rb and take a lot of criminal behavior to do that sc no i had great 
with neha narula talking about digital money and first we had to agree that money right rb right sc 
digital currencies are struggling with that right now rb so the perception of safety and security whether in the 
or your person that a lot of the earliest chemical tests were based solely on sc rb on a 
of the protection and community and security of what does that mean because had to all agree in trust 
right rb and yet trust can be violated sc yeah and so once we get to the renaissance if 
borgia and you have an annoying cousin what do you do how do i go shopping for poison or 
i need to make it myself rb well or have your righthand person but also your apothecaries and your 
and i think always been always been challenges what is that old proverb only way to the only way 
people can keep a secret is of two of them are the more coconspirators that you have sc yeah 
problem rb and so sure if you can do it yourself and keep your own counsel to but i 
actually a biblical phrase your own then that would be better in that sc right rb and so some 
these folks were actually quite good but also the important thing to remember is at the same time that 
things are lethal and poisonous a lot of the same things were in cosmetics in smaller quantities they were 
medicinal it would not be uncommon especially in an affluent household when we think of gonna open my medicine 
and got a acetaminophen and aspirin and antacids and nine types of bandaids of various sizes and i have 
you have this whole spread especially in a big household sc right rb well that was sc so the 
of that back rb equivalent of that would have have sc a whole lot of rb it would not 
been uncommon to have some of these things and then also think about pest control which was also kind 
a big deal and also that the beginning of understanding the pest role in disease and all of that 
it also uncommon to get rid of vermin just because they ate your food and even if the disease 
came later you knew they were eating your food they were eating through your clothes they were just pests 
so how do you get rid of the them sc okay rb so it was totally not uncommon for 
to have buckets of the craziest stuff in their house or to also be using it in some much 
quantity in a medicinal way again whether it worked or not sc this sounds like a very kind of 
to me was that the high point for ingesting crazy substances as potential miracle cures rb can go much 
sc really okay rb and kind of fun to go to museums and see these chests of things and 
realize especially again the more affluent the house or whatever the equivalent would be of middle class and up 
even more precarious socioeconomic positions there were kind of the community medicinal chest sc right rb or things people 
access to sc so what kinds of things rb so you just had to say so different herbs and 
of the things that we would think now are like so like flavoring agents or things like that sc 
rb or peppermint different mints that were soothing on the stomach or let me do a combination of a 
bit of mint with pennyroyal and add in these kind of concoctions that inherited from grandma whoever and it 
seemed to work and again that the fun thing is from a natural products thing a lot of things 
you carried forward and you are like that actually did work and so gonna now make it and manufacture 
and aspirin so some of these things and people go back to a whole area of scholarship where people 
back into historical tests and try to figure out what was this thing and then test it sc right 
against modern or historic diseases and see that it really even on a weird way honey and mud mummification 
properties and honey it it a weird thing or because it was sticky it actually it sc sorry i 
that honey played a huge role in mummification is that true rb yeah a little bit lots of different 
of mummification protocols but some protocols actually a thin layer of honey and it did it did help keep 
some of the little bacteria friends from getting a bit out of control sc crazy to me because it 
like sweet and nutritious and it would attract all sorts of crazy things rb but jampacked full another chemical 
things like honey and coffee we just think about of what they contain sc okay rb and thousand chemicals 
got all kinds of stuff in there an animal product honey got all kinds of cool stuff in there 
could be serving some really interesting purpose sc right rb what are the animals doing with it not sure 
making it so that i can have it on my toast right so some really and again an active 
of scholarship and some of the plants that people grow ornamental might be poisonous or ornamental and it seems 
if i place it here it keeps down these types of pests and well releasing this volatile organic chemical 
really something in that people have known about and gardeners not an accident that these very elaborate gardens that 
planned out plants were where they were and it just because they looked cool when you talk to or 
read these old historical documents you realize why trying to keep down pests or trying to attract certain or 
gardens place certain things there because if you well you would want your medicinal garden close to the house 
gonna have sc that makes sense rb hike out laughter sc right rb and so some of that knowledge 
we just again we have better tools so we can kind of find or dismiss certain things and i 
kind of the fun part is that you can look back and say well that explains or like have 
idea why everyone was putting sprinkling arsenic why why were you people doing that laughter sc well nowadays we 
know a lot more would we be able to commit the perfect crime with our chemistry knowledge hypothetically of 
not advocating anything here rb whenever and i do done some panels where how to commit the perfect murder 
things like that and funny because i never think it comes with planning in that way and the perfect 
weapon because sometimes even chemicals like succinylcholine which is a really scary agent a medical purpose if used probably 
gonna be intubated and it works on a certain type of muscle where completely gonna paralyze it unfortunately the 
of muscles are also the ones that help you breathe however if you need intubation they need to get 
tube down your throat and all very well coordinated sc right rb but if you use it for nefarious 
it goes very bad and for a long time it was such an odd poison to use as a 
again we have the ones that developed a lot of tests for that we know what they look like 
are the symptoms our got very simple tests gonna be the first run like arsenic say carbon monoxide your 
turns like a cherry red other types of drugs that would cause cyanosis your skin would turn blue but 
like succinylcholine is such a very specific application not one of the heavy hitter poisons the historical poisons that 
literally found now been the jig is up because it just was not commonly used sc so i guess 
so you could at one that really went under the radar and you could get away with some stuff 
nobody was looking for it sc laughter so if poisoning somebody you might want a chemical that disappears from 
body rb rapid metabolism which that can be an issue another one would be some of say your drugfacilitated 
molecules like scopolamine which i wrote about recently where again not only is it an issue because the metabolism 
be fast but one of its effects is memory loss chuckle sc ah perfect rb and it affects so 
the time you might even realize or even if you do that maybe i should seek medical attention three 
later and whether a metabolite could be found or which metabolites i mean so the action itself limits its 
to be found and a big but sc great rb a whole area of scholarship going with that one 
really seeking out sc i like this one yeah rb so every new drug or new poison requires another 
of people like myself who develop a method like a race a race against time somebody comes up with 
and gotta find a test for it sc so perfect murder is easily solved crime but you gotta keep 
of the curve rb yes same thing with inheritance pattern sure it got that nickname but for a lot 
times people were able to get away with some really outrageous stuff and then we developed the tests sc 
a lot of these even if they disappear from the body because they metabolized they have some other effect 
like you turn red like you said rb there could be other effect but even if metabolized as long 
other important area of scholarship is really understanding that metabolism because even if you find the parent compound anymore 
can find all of little metabolites in certain ratios and then like indirect but very good evidence and tons 
those and so again a so the application of building a technique does depend on that good old not 
old fashion that clinical metabolism really getting the mechanism and the why so you can build a better test 
me it all comes together full circle an applied scientist but the reason i can build better tests is 
have to understand the basic research in the clinical applications and the roots in order to get to the 
where the little test that everyone takes for granted that so simple sc it comes back to the science 
it always comes back to that sc you wrote this wonderful little snippet in one of your columns that 
relevant here its red color bubbles and sweetness cherry lambrini is a popular tipple it is also the disguise 
the sweet killer ethylene rb oh one of my favorites ethylene glycol was another one that for a long 
went under the radar an antifreeze sc an antifreeze or it rb it is antifreeze sc oh okay rb 
so of sc again easily rb easily obtained you can buy literally gallons of it now the reason why 
not actually that weird green sc they color it rb they color it because like drink this incredibly dangerous 
of course the danger like that is that very sweet like lead acetate a very sweet thing and so 
you disguise it if trying to poison someone much like say a lot of also plantbased poisons are alkaloids 
they can taste very bitter and so where do you hide it and so why of course even in 
you see a lot of these poisons in red wine sc or elaborate cocktails rb or sc sweetened vinegar 
rb the campari or some kind of thing where like sc antifreeze negroni rb going but antifreeze would be 
sweet that that kind of there was a big case where it was hidden in a propel or like 
gatorade gatorade is can be sweet sc would you want to hide it in something else that was sweet 
do you wanna balance it maybe thinking more as a mixologist rather than a killer chuckle rb right and 
think that that is your first mistake no but you want sc be a terrible murderer i see rb 
want alike right if expecting sweet like this husband and wife like my wedding sc yeah this is a 
case rb this is a real case and my goto to wedding toast is your marriage never be described 
perfect by because then you know sc chuckle rb but in this case such a sweet beverage that adding 
little sc a little bit of antifreeze rb is gonna disguise it you wanna add something like sc right 
weird rb somebody would drink it first of all the white powder really have to work to get it 
but also that bitterness would seem odd so if a friend was a negroni drinker not gonna put antifreeze 
it because the minute it hits the sc so sweet rb off they would like who made and dump 
and so part of it is you want to do like dissolves and of course you have the really 
ones that are colorless odorless tasteless which of course is dangerous for the person and maybe just what the 
ordered for the villain sc so a known list of those things colorless odorless rb oh yeah actually a 
little review article about the seven about seven common homicide poisonings sc oh okay rb and weird or not 
but just like everything else things are in vogue things are not in vogue sc yeah fashion rb and 
it also becomes of how easy it is to get sc sure you want to arouse suspicion rb part 
a good old fashion gumshoe intelligence police work just amass the information and there was a really old case 
involved strychnine where a person went you can just go to a store and buy it because again for 
getting rid of rats still utilized in these kind of poisoned weed sprinkled around and so the shop owner 
like you did come in and you did buy that and you bought it and that was almost two 
years ago and then of course there was one hundred fifty years yeah that was one hundred fifty years 
and then there was a test there was again these preliminary tests of looking at these things then there 
that and they discovered that but again the tests were done later the tests are always later you just 
and you went to every place that sold it you looked on the farm and yeah she was here 
the good old fashion kind of gumshoe stuff and even i think the thing is that even when you 
the tests people are still gonna want to where did they get sc yeah we live in a world 
a lot of records that are left by everything we do so becoming harder and harder to commit a 
murder rb yeah and i think the some people ask me about committing a perfect crime and some really 
scheme i think the better thing to do is that when people sc keep it simple stupid rb yeah 
with really a kind of sometimes a perfect storm of incompetence sometimes if a just low response time certain 
collected that should have been maybe the investigative officers made mistakes or there were accidents or again there could 
been some level of professional incompetence the prosecuting attorney declines almost like a perfect storm of things that can 
where you plan for that though unless you literally did the investigation like needs to be on the corner 
sepulveda and at this time at night between a shift change and that would how did you find out 
you know that pulling your google search records that kind of stuff and so it can be the more 
plan the plan reveals your maleficence sc true a good point yeah laughter but some sometimes i get mail 
prisoners who want me to give them a free copy of my book or something like that cause they 
it in prison rb yeah yeah sc and part of me wants to help them out of course in 
and they wanna improve themselves but when you get mail from prisoners it always includes their prisoner number and 
can go and look up what they did and so rb okay you get way more exciting mail than 
do sc yeah so far the gotten not like mail fraud really bad things that this people did one 
pretty clear that he killed his grandmother and they never found her body she disappeared and from staying with 
and things like that but he got imprisoned for a related thing but they never found her body how 
you get rid of the body the other thing once committed the perfect crime rb well you got a 
of options but also weaknesses body transport can be where you get caught key cases where moving people and 
bodies is when you got pulled over for that broken taillight and so sc how often do taillights get 
anyway rb be surprised or some or speeding or a parking fine sc because nervous rb or something like 
and so but then okay you move it then upped the number of people that see you and especially 
with cctv sc right rb in parking garages and just the street and stop lights and one of the 
things that folks will do is pull cameras from as many locations as they can and gonna have to 
through it all so all of literally just the transport can be hard and also i would advise this 
actually a real case google disposal sites in the los angeles laughter sc you go to the dark web 
do this without leaving a track laughter rb just but also again are you gonna bury it in your 
are you gonna transport that time leaves you open and vulnerable there was a different case where someone bought 
type things and they paid cash but they went to a store with cameras and then for some reason 
wanted to use their club card so they could get a discount chuckle you cannot make these things up 
behavior sc a selection effect that this are the ones caught right rb right but on the other but 
think chemical disposal methods acid or base fire to try obliterate it that way there is sc it would 
very difficult to incinerate a body if you have the right equipment rb oh no you can do it 
okay rb i think sc dry it out first rb i think time and where at and how hot 
can get things that might shorten the time sc so if out if in a cabin in the woods 
might be the way to go rb maybe but then why is there a huge smoke thing coming from 
cabin sc true rb and i think always that you what you plan for is someone that decided to 
them and their friend hike past your remote cabin and see you carrying that thing rolled up in a 
out to the bonfire right laughter sc this laughter rb and even the cases and in recent years heard 
used to be the cliche was body no it was at one time harder to prosecute those things but 
with the advent of as much data and how everything is kind of logged and you have to kind 
access certain records unless this person has totally ghosted everyone and then gone completely off the grid which is 
really hard to do dead chuckle and not and then you look at the behavior and how they would 
of carry on their life not accessing their bank or card they do a major withdrawal their credit cards 
used their car is still there all of these things then reasonable to conclude something has occurred and so 
with the ramp up of technology and sometimes there are concerns about privacy and things like that are legitimate 
at the same time like maybe a couple hundred years ago maybe even fifty or sixty years ago people 
have been like body no sc way easier to get away with the crime rb but now like no 
signature means that aunt glenda is just so hard to do that sc but the saving grace is that 
crime labs are backed up by months or years that make it easier rb i think that the other 
again a practical administration problem and seen unfortunately seen that manifest itself especially with sexual assault test kits and 
statue of limitations where talking warehouses full of kits and there was a great bunch of work where sc 
kits that have just not been analyzed rb analyzed because again the backlog the cost the combination of those 
but when they have gotten the funds and actually gone through and there was i believe it was in 
they did all of this work and analysis they got this funding and they were able to process all 
backlog kits and they found a number of serial predators and when you look at the data again you 
back to the data and you look at these numbers and you look at again not oversaying it when 
warehouses full of stuff that just again you get away with it not because you leave evidence behind but 
of limitations in staff instruments budgets and shocking and somehow so ordinary to say that but that absolutely influences 
every other type of analysis it absolutely influences what you can do sc sure i always like to end 
a more or less optimistic note and that was not it rb sorry sorry laughter sc as we wrap 
up i do wanna say i hope that most of your students go into lives of fighting crime rather 
committing it rb me too sc they seem prepared for either one but presumably the ones who are best 
would be good at either one but is it an exciting frontier for chemistry now in catching bad guys 
better and better ways rb i like to think of it maybe as keeping us safe and again not 
catching bad guys but i think also the things that we think about or just kind of workplace contaminants 
environmental accidents or as someone who lives in austin texas we just had this boil water notice sc what 
that rb boil water notice there was sc boil the water rb you had to boil all the water 
the processing plants able to function at the way they could and when again like a storm or again 
it have to be malfeasant and so when i think about my students and even the work i do 
would still be forensic even if not duplicitous is that in the business of keeping us safe and being 
to have confidence in the things that we take for granted our food and our drink and our air 
i think that being able to have the skill set to keep yourself safe or at least be able 
look at the data and make good choices i feel like giving empowering folks and so kind of how 
look at what i do rather than the opposite of catching bad guys sc good most people wanna kill 
or even catch bad people they just wanna live their lives safely and happily and this is helping them 
yeah they wanna drink their water and eat their kale smoothies and their bacon chuckle and so how i 
at it even though the csi and the forensic stuff is sexy and people find it interesting for the 
part what we do is this mundane stuff that you just wanna be able to your milk is gonna 
good your water is safe to drink and got a safe train station to walk through with no contaminants 
in some small way i think a lot of scientists in general i think a lot of scientists are 
wanna help whatever small way that is sc and thankful for it ray burks thanks so much for being 
the podcast rb thank you music wow what a great episode outstanding guest prof burks had so many fascinating 
to say that i knew nothing about and also had a great sense of humour i bet her classes
