to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today be talking about truth and justice very hard to 
that phrase without thinking of superman right justice and the american american part never quite made sense superman was 
a different planet after all he came from krypton he should be about truth and justice for everybody in 
american was tacked on when the superman radio serial was being broadcast during world war ii and people thought 
was really important that the superheroes be on side in this conflict it was later dropped and then it 
picked up again when we entered the cold war and ever since then superman has for some reason or 
thought that america was the best country sc but guest dr alice dreger is all about the truth and 
justice parts of this motto and a nontrivial thing to say because truth and justice although both virtues are 
different things it may happen in the course of human events that the search for truth and the search 
justice come into conflict either apparent conflict or real honesttogoodness conflict and dr specialty as a historian and author 
in human gender and sexuality and more generally how our bodies relate to ourselves as you might imagine this 
a set of hotbutton issues when it comes to humanity bodies and sexuality so perhaps not surprising that dr 
has been involved in all number of academic controversies her controversies and her research involve things like intersexuality transgenderism 
censorship and so on sc dr dreger is the author of a wonderful book called middle finger heretics activists 
one search for as talk about in the podcast actual honesttogoodness finger is on display in a museum in 
you can go see it well worth it at the galileo museum while everyone else is looking at the 
you can go see the galileo relics there but also a symbol galileo was an ornery kind of person 
fought for both truth and for justice he back down under political pressure and what be talking about today 
talking about the various ways in which you can try to get to the truth you can try to 
to justice and even though we would like to think that the ultimate goal of truth and justice coincides 
the most just world is one in which also telling the truth it can sometimes happen that the road 
truth and the road to justice always run on parallel tracks sc a fascinating story no matter what your 
substantive beliefs are about any of the controversies the goal of trying to be a good intellectual and honest 
finding out the truth about the world while also being an activist in the sense of trying to make 
world a better place is one that we can all strive to uphold so go music sc alice dreger 
to the mindscape podcast alice dreger phd thanks sean sc so you were in the news recently even the 
a lot okay but there was a recent episode there was a story in the new york times by 
weiss about something called intellectual dark and it was accompanied with moody photographs of the members of this dark 
all of whom it was hard exactly to figure out what the commonalities were but there was something about 
forbidden scary truths in a certain set of venues that might not be the most obvious intellectually common ones 
you were invited to be part of this article and part of the dark web and after some consideration 
declined you let your picture get taken if i understand but then you asked not to be included in 
article and you wrote a little piece in the chronicle of higher education about that so could you explain 
a little bit what your thoughts were on that maybe that will lead us into the bigger picture here 
yeah not sure i can explain the dark web i mean what i know the dark web as is 
other dark web right the place where nefarious things happen off of the visible internet but the intellectual dark 
as i understand it is supposed to be some sort of connected group of people who say things that 
particular piss off progressives as far as i can tell and certainly said things that have pissed off some 
but the reason i asked to get out of this article profile was because it struck me as increasingly 
the more i learned about it ad the fellow who came out to take my and if seen these 
i think is a good way to describe it they were all done exactly at a particular moment with 
to sunset and when the photographer called me and told me how it was gonna be and we needed 
be outside at a very particular time it was gonna be this very particular moment at sunset i was 
i mean this guy is a pulitzer prizewinning photographer his photographs are amazing so whatever i know for features 
sometimes do particular types of photos but then having gone through that and talked to him i became i 
i was already worried before that because i kept saying to bari know what this intellectual dark web is 
i even know of half the people talking so she would name names like supposed to know who these 
are and not that not important or famous i just spend a lot of time making a point of 
with big names and so i like connecting with ordinary people and smart people especially and so it just 
me as something that i had no idea what she was talking about and then this photo struck me 
something where i felt kind of silly doing it and laughter ad i was very nervous and i remember 
after the photographer left i said to my husband gotta get out of this because i just think meant 
be in and i said think going to feel silly if part of a group that i even know 
half these people are and i certainly have a good sense of what makes us a and then the 
came out and i was rather relieved that i in it because as far as i could tell there 
to be any logical categorization in which i belonged there are people in that group that i really respect 
mean people like bret weinstein and heather hague who are academics in exile which they say so am i 
know we all chosen at some level to be out of academia at the moment but i really respect 
two of them and the work that they do and all of that but i figure out otherwise what 
was supposed to have in common with these other people other than interest seemed to be a lot about 
idea that those of us in this alleged group sometimes say things like yes sex does matter in rape 
not just about power it may also be about sex or in some circumstances for the rapist not to 
a good thing just to say talking about it simply as power really makes sense of some of what 
see ad and we say things like there are some inborn sex differences on average or we say things 
evolution matters and these are supposedly things that not allowed to say only we are all saying them so 
claim that not supposed to say these things is it the case that people push back yeah sure sorry 
mail just got delivered what that clunk was ad is the case that not supposed that we say these 
and people push back yeah certainly people push back but i mean people have been pushing back at things 
saying for thirty years nothing new social media makes it more intense and it catches fire faster but just 
virtue of irritating people i think makes one special as an intellectual sc certainly had no trouble hearing people 
that biological differences do matter not exactly a completely silenced point of view out there in the world ad 
at all i mean it may be the case that among a certain set of progressives saying biology matters 
verboten but within a large segment of academia people are researching it and we talk about it and we 
about how do we think about that in terms of how we approach equality and how do we think 
it in terms of how we support people so i think that really something not allowed to say sc 
really like the thing in your chronicle article you pinpointed this idea that the goal should not be to 
the right people off right a tempting thing and i think that it speaks to the larger trajectory of 
career trying to balance a backandforth between saying true things and resisting kind of being funneled down to an 
comfortable spot and thinking that you are an oppressed minority saying uncomfortable truths a slightly flattering way to think 
yourself that is indeed very tempting ad yeah i think it it becomes an easy way to get out 
responsibility and by that i mean if i get to say so oppressed and sort of not having to 
responsible to the fact that maybe what said really is very threatening to somebody and maybe what saying really 
disruptive to their worldview potentially dangerous for them so i like that way of thinking about it in part 
i think really important that those of us who say things that are politically intense take responsibility for that 
address the challenges and the questions that arise from that and that definitely is part of what bothered me 
the approach was like you piss people off therefore i think magic sc right right yeah yeah yeah like 
said a comfortable place to be for a certain kind of personality but not exactly supposed to be what 
or scholars signed ad i am bummed i never got to see my picture sc you get a copy 
your picture come on you could ask sure ad well bari said gonna send it to me and then 
published that piece in the chronicle then she stopped talking to me so i think never gonna get to 
my picture gonna be the famous playing card nobody ever got to see and someday it will be worth 
dollars you think sc you should do a parody of it just standing out field in the with your 
all muddy right like taken on an iphone you i think that should be your cover photo ad i 
totally do that sc so suspecting that when you started off the academic path as a graduate student as 
historian you suspect that this is how your career trajectory would go is that safe to say ad i 
i know where it was gonna go i mean the thing is i dropped out of college so i 
really expected to go to graduate school i never expected to become an academic so i when i was 
an academic i have a firm sense of what that was gonna mean for my future and i mean 
i know what it involved i know what it involved but i also my husband jokes that i change 
every two pi years laughter ad that would be sc two pi has its own letter ad yeah right 
right sc tau right yeah every tau years good so you can be hip to a whole audience by 
it that way ad i change careers every tau years so i was a very highachieving high school student 
i was very burned out and i said to my parents should not go to school right now too 
and back then there was no such thing called a so i say i need a gap year it 
anything it was just it was being a student drop out right so my parents begged me to go 
school which i did for a year i went to georgetown university for a year and i was still 
burned out so i dropped out and i became a mortgage broker for five years on long island and 
only finished my degree because i was getting tired of mortgage brokering and i thought maybe go into real 
law so i finished my degree at the state university down the street and my advisor told me about 
school and it sounded really great you could read and people would pay you to read that sounded really 
good to me sc it is kind of awesome i have to admit ad i was also in therapy 
my therapist declared me cured and he was like out of new york so that you like out of 
just leave leave your boyfriend leave your cats leave your parents leave so i thought well going to graduate 
is a good way to leave everybody so i did that and the truth is my graduate department lost 
application and they admitted me out of embarrassment i found out years later laughter ad so i was admitted 
accident but i was good at it and i also worked really hard i was used to working fulltime 
going to school fulltime so i was a really hard worker and so when i got to graduate school 
everybody else had gone a normal path they were used to being kinda frankly lazy they were used to 
around and doing nothing but school and so i whipped through graduate school and graduated in record time for 
department and went on and got an academic job and everything but i guess i to think this is 
direction my career eh i know i had a sense of i should know what doing next in order 
pay the rent and what always done and then when i had a kid in the year i realized 
really liked him and i ad enjoyed being with him he was very interesting he was much more interesting 
i expected having a child would be and so i gave up tenure in two thousand four to be 
my son more and also to do more mainstream writing and do more activism of the type i was 
which was for patient rights in the field of intersex which is when people are born with not the 
male or standard female anatomy so i dropped out of tenured life and i took a parttime job at 
long distance so never really had an organized life around the standard systems just i guess i get bored 
and so i stick with things my right around six years is as long as i stick with things 
with him stuck with him much longer ad and kept my son now ad so the idea that like 
in some intellectual dark web just like laughter sc yeah just doing your thing ad it just strikes me 
weird so sc but you did there was a point at which in grad school you were gonna be 
historian in a fairly conventional way and you were ad no i was gonna be a philosopher no i 
gonna be a philosopher sc oh you were gonna be a philosopher sorry ad the department i was in 
history and philosophy of science and i went to graduate school thinking do philosophy of science but i like 
kind of philosophy of science being done at my program which was this very intense theoretical type of philosophy 
so i switched over to doing history and i really liked it i really like the concreteness of history 
i really like the detective work of history so then i became a historian but i set out to 
i really went to graduate school to get out of new york but i became then a historian yeah 
now a historian except now a journalist i gave up doing academic life a couple of years ago so 
but even as a historian not like you were studying shipping routes you decided to study hermaphrodism in the 
is that about right ad yes i was and am a feminist and i was interested in the question 
how medicine and science coped with biological blurriness when they were insisting that there were only two sexes so 
the century so the late in particular there was this big political movement that had begun among women for 
rights so that was the early part of feminism and there was also a movement among people we now 
call and people to demand their rights and so these were people who were challenging gender norms very strongly 
i was curious to know what doctors did when they were faced with the fact that biology is blurry 
all their claims about gender were that only two sexes and no inbetween and in fact there is in 
so i was curious about that so i started publishing on what had happened in the late century and 
people who were intersex living then which was the started contacting me and asking me to look at what 
going on today in the medical system and to help them change the medical system so then i got 
contemporary intersex treatment and that led me into bioethics by accident so some people think a bioethicist but not 
really a historian who does patient advocacy work sometimes sc right so the whole idea of intersex is fascinating 
i think for me the best way to get into it is you have a page on your blog 
the question can a person be born with two sets of genitals with one male and one female set 
genitals and you have a very definitive statement about this ad no laughter ad but you can absolutely be 
with parts of both sexes so males and females start off with all the same parts and if you 
a high level of androgens and sensitive to that so a kinda masculinizing hormone go the male route and 
low level typically go the female route but it turns out a hundred different ways besides that that can 
in between or can mix things up the reason you have both sets of genitals is because people are 
born with one set of parts so either go left or right or in between or be mixed up 
terms of the types but you have genitals of both types unless what you mean is can you have 
vaginal opening with a penis yes you can have that but you have say a penis and a clitoris 
same organ in development and you have the labia majora and the scrotum the same organ in development so 
go one way or another or in between so people tend to have this sort of weird imagination that 
you could be completely male and completely female you you only have one set of parts so you can 
one way or another or blend up sc yeah and i think that this is just an underappreciated fact 
human anatomy and development but it makes perfect sense from an evolutionary point of view evolution uses what it 
and tries to solve problems in a relatively simple way but the fact that the male and female genitalia 
organs are two different versions of what starts out as the same thing and that the male scrotum is 
the female labia that developed in a different way an amazing fact i think that is not very wellunderstood 
no right and there are some nice animations now online that show genital development in fetuses that shows you 
sort of slide a thing back and forth and see what does it look like if it develops as 
or as male or in between and this is stuff i know certainly when i went to graduate school 
was stuff i only found out pretty much by accident and then i was fascinated to learn like why 
i not heard about this because this seems really interesting and really kind of important to know about sex 
i realized well because the medical system had suppressed it for generations and kept the knowledge from us because 
the idea that this was disruptive frankly to the social order and that telling people about it was just 
confuse people and create a kind of discomfort which it does it often does create discomfort for people sc 
this fact helps explain why there is this idea this concept of intersex intersexuality and you already alluded to 
fact that in addition to simply having xx or xy by the way not the only possibilities right more 
things you can have but also more to it than that how these things get expressed because of the 
that you have and the hormones sensitive to and how they develop over time so as you say all 
of different specific ways in which you can be something other than the standard stereotypical male or female ad 
randomness in the process so just like you can be born missing a finger you can be born missing 
penis and have everything else in terms of male development so lots of variation in the system and right 
makes sense in terms of evolution because sex development is a key part of evolution how we mix up 
genes and so sex turns out to be very important in terms of evolution and whenever anything is important 
terms of evolution then gonna be a complex developmental process and gonna be variation and where you get these 
and variation happens through randomness but it also happens sometimes because of genetic conditions running in families so there 
at least different ways you can develop in terms of sex and far more than that if you count 
a different way but plenty of different ways you can develop in terms of sex development sc and i 
written on the question which is extraordinarily important in certain circles but what about when we have the olympics 
we have sports and sports how do we decide what is the right criterion for dividing up people according 
that classification ad really hard to figure out the answer to that and the answer to that depends on 
trying to achieve so if what trying to achieve is a sort of mythical level playing field then gonna 
stuck and the reason gonna be stuck is because humans vary a tremendous amount and if you start making 
decision in terms of sex gonna sort of draw the line right got to justify why drawing the line 
there and what the olympic committee would say is that people playing as women have too high a level 
androgens because it gives them an unfair advantage the thing is women naturally make androgen so i think a 
female based on what i know about my own biology never had my chromosomes checked but pretty sure a 
female and making androgens right now in my adrenal glands in the back of my body just like other 
and also making some androgens in my ovaries right now because where we make males meanwhile make estrogen in 
testes ad so all the sex hormones all making all of them just males make more of them than 
average female will make and so to make the claim gonna cut off where supposedly unfair for a female 
is a difficult argument to make because making so why should we be told not allowed to have a 
high level of them we do that when it comes for example to height we say too tall to 
we say to people in terms of their ability to process oxygen you were born with a genetic advantage 
not allowed to use that genetic advantage not allowed to no we say if born with it allowed to 
with but where women are concerned where intersex gets involved where the olympic committee tries to cut things off 
it becomes very difficult to do that ad my own feeling is and written about this most recently for 
new york times basically the rules come up with are pretty absurd because they declare certain sex hormones to 
sort of the property of men even though women do make them and then they also have a system 
setting up a system that has to measure something that really yet be measured so trying to measure not 
do you make these hormones but do they affect you and we have a good system for understanding to 
degree affecting tissues and the effectiveness of hormones on our tissues varies according to people so kind of a 
system it they may have the data to show that testosterone improves performance in certain events and they do 
that data and i believe that data i believe testosterone absolutely gives you an advantage in certain events certain 
events but they then leap to a policy that i think is very hard to justify and where they 
falling down on their faces ad and when i advised the olympic committee in i think it was i 
there in switzerland basically what i said to them is making the same mistake that the olympic committees made 
and over again every time tried to adjudicate sex according to biology and running up against the problem where 
is complicated and genders come in two categories for purposes of the olympics why you just admit got two 
categories and stop trying to police the but the answer is afraid the chinese will raise their sons as 
and afraid that have boys playing as girls in the olympics sc i mean almost as if nature and 
natural world is very complicated and fluid and full of all kinds of crazy things but we human beings 
like to impose on nature these orderly categories and then we get upset when nature does not conform to 
order we wanna impose on it ad we certainly do and we get even more upset if involved ad 
where the olympics is concerned a sc and there are winners and losers ad a crapload of money involved 
a lot of money at stake in terms of these decisions and part of going on what cracked me 
is when i went to that meeting there was an advisory meeting they had a series of advisory meetings 
i was one of many people that they invited to comment and critique and have a conversation about this 
what became clear to me is that it was mostly men making decisions about sports and i was curious 
would happen if women were actually in charge of sports and what decision women would make and i suspect 
would be different because i suspect women who have been athletes are very sensitive to the idea of having 
body policed happened to them over and over and over again and i think they would have more sympathy 
the people getting caught in that policing but i know because right now men are largely in charge of 
at that level sc and this policing in some sense in a different context was what led in you 
go on the journey from being a historian to an activist because you stumbled across the fact that surgeons 
policing maleness and femaleness of infants as soon as they were born they would notice that someone was intersex 
way or the other and try to fix them and number one that was historically interesting it started happening 
guess in the but tell me but then it was still happening even today ad yeah we started to 
the beginnings of that approach in the the late but when surgery got better then surgeons got more aggressive 
part of what has occurred is the idea that anybody left sexually in between will grow up to be 
and depressed and rejected and therefore they will kill themselves and so you have to fix every baby to 
closer to a standard male or standard female type now intersex by the way sometimes occurs where on the 
of the body you look very clearly like one sex but on the inside you have the organs of 
other so when talking about the early intersex interventions done by surgeons talking about cases where visible sex anomalies 
the outside of the body and in those cases still today what happens is most surgeons say you wanna 
a kid in between and therefore we should either surgically make this child look more male or more in 
cases that means female because surgeons have a sort of high standard when it comes to what a male 
look like and a rather low standard when it comes to what a female should look like sc male 
talking about presumably ad yeah largely ad largely male surgeons they think penises are very fancy organs and vaginas 
just holes and vaginas are not just holes actually very fancy organs the vaginal tube the thing that is 
vagina the tube that goes from the opening on the outside up to the uterus is actually a very 
organ but they treat it as such they treat it as something that can be replicated by creating a 
basically a hole that medically safe hole so that started happening in earnest starting in the and an generations 
of people who grew up that way who were lied to about their medical history who have surgical problems 
from what happened some of whom had their fertility taken away from them because any chance of fertility was 
in the sex assignment process and those people became activists many of them became activists in the intersex rights 
starting especially in the ad and it was a pretty active movement at the point which i was contacted 
some of those people and i joined the movement as well because i could see that what they were 
was absolutely in the medical literature and it was going on and to me it was really disturbing to 
what was going on it that the doctors had bad intentions they really wanted what was best for these 
but they had a very narrow idea of what was possible and they had a very bad science extremely 
science when it came to following up whether or not this was actually working sc and did is it 
to say that you and your friends had actually had an effect on the practice that the surgeons now 
a little bit more aware of going on ad certainly much more aware whether or not changed the practice 
an open question afraid we changed it nearly enough what has changed is now doctors say the and so 
parents are kinda pressured in many cases to make those decisions and are told fine if you just do 
we tell and parents tend to follow with their pediatricians tell them to do so there are a bunch 
clinicians now that i know that are reformists who strongly feel as i do that you can raise kids 
boys or girls but leave their bodies intact if no medical emergency let them decide for themselves later whether 
not they wanna take the risk of changing anything about their body let them have bodily autonomy and for 
clinicians they find parents are comfortable with what recommending and i think because in those circumstances their pediatricians are 
them okay and to wait and okay to let this child decide for him or herself how do they 
handle their body so for some places better but in a lot of places the same old system just 
the parents are blamed for the decisionmaking rather than the surgeons taking responsibility for the decisionmaking sc and what 
it like for you sort of lifestylewise and intellectually to become an activist while you were also being an 
scholar and a professor ad well since i was in the humanities it that hard because unfortunately the humanities 
largely gone in the direction of doing politics i think of myself as being in what i see often 
the lazy versions of that within the humanities and academia in some circumstances but for me it was exhausting 
because i was helping to run a national and international movement from my house and at the same time 
a fulltime academic career which involved publishing in peerreviewed journals which i like doing but it you know intense 
doing the kinds of teaching that was intensive teaching i really liked teaching and also doing service work so 
was doing fulltime academic work and also basically fulltime helping to run the intersex society of north cause and 
the and then i had a kid on top of it all and that just became untenable in terms 
the lifestyle so when i made a list of what i enjoyed doing the things i enjoy doing involved 
academic ad so i gave that up and switched what i was doing at that point sc and then 
got involved in i guess a related but different controversy about transgenderism which is different just get all the 
on the table here a lot going on when we talk about sex and how sex plays out in 
world sort of at the very least our biological sex our gender identity how we think of ourselves as 
or female according to the standards of the world we live in our gender expression what clothes we wear 
mannerisms and so forth and our sexual orientation who we are attracted to and all of these things are 
on at once and the intersex is about more or less our biological sex as it were and transgenderism 
about our gender identity is that correct did i get that right ad yes congratulations you have it exactly 
laughter sc well i will just mention that before i got into this controversy over transgenderism i expanded my 
outward and looked at what else was happening to children born with normchallenging bodies so i looked at things 
conjoined twins and the way they were treated in society and in medicine and i looked at people with 
people with giantism and those sorts things in the book i did that and topic was called of us 
twins and the future of and a it was published by harvard but a very readable book basically designed 
be used for freshman undergraduates sort of getting into this question of what do our bodies have to do 
who we are and when should we change our bodies and when should we hold back and think about 
society instead ad so yes so intersex is about how our bodies are when born and transgenderism or gender 
about how we feel about ourselves so i often tell people that intersex people and transgender people had opposite 
but for the same core reason historically so intersex people were getting sexchange operations they ask for and transgender 
historically had a hard time getting sexchange operations they did want but they were both suffering for the same 
which was a patriarchal medical system that said get to decide what look like and get to decide what 
you so finally changing and it certainly changed a lot more on the transgender side and today fortunately much 
for people who may benefit from hormonal changes and from surgical changes to go ahead and elect those for 
and a very positive development ad actually swinging very far in that direction and now starting to see some 
with sending people down that route without actually doing an adequate work up to see if really gonna help 
in terms of their own personal situations but certainly better than it used to be when it was very 
difficult for people to get access to legal sex change or gender change and social gender change and then 
surgical changes to their bodies to match the way that they felt sc and a similar issue comes up 
the conjoined twins right there was this surgical idea that it would help them to separate them that would 
them more normal we have categories we have a view of what a person should be like and that 
have another person attached to them and you found that in fact lots of conjoined twins would prefer just 
remain conjoined if healthy in that condition ad yeah i was shocked by that when i came to the 
of conjoined twins i fully expected that anybody who could be separated would elect to do so that nobody 
be doing okay conjoined and instead when i looked historically at all the cases i could find not as 
of them as other types of variations in the world so that was a little bit easier when i 
at that what i found was that there was only one single case in history where conjoined twins old 
to do so for themselves chose separation and both of them died from it and that historically over time 
throughout different cultures conjoined twins said the same thing if they grew up together they said know this normal 
the rest of the world but this is normal for us and i wanna live the way you so 
was really surprising to me was they consistently said way we live is superior to the way you live 
you must get lonely and you have anybody with you all the time and we have somebody with us 
the so the thing that we see as a terrible disadvantage is seen by them to be a huge 
ad and when i thought about it i realized that have surprised me so much so speaking for example 
somebody who was born female and has grown up as a girl and then a woman i know that 
against in terms of wages in terms of political representation much more likely to be sexually assaulted than a 
is all of these things but my solution to that is not i wish i was a right ad 
though i know that that would eliminate the discrimination i experienced so conjoined twins were saying basically the same 
they were saying know subject to a lot of discrimination but i think the problem i think the problem 
the discrimination so as i began to look at that and then look at what the surgeries did to 
in some circumstances separation surgeries are very simple practically outpatient surgeries in some cases and in some cases just 
little bit complicated but not a big deal but in many of the cases we hear about enormously complicated 
they leave people really damaged if joined at the head they leave them braindamaged if joined say sharing a 
in the middle part they are left without organs it often disrupts their sexual sensation and function it will 
their ability to have normal bowel movements to have urinary function have problems with pulmonary function in some cases 
what doing is separating the upper part of the body ad so really not the case that simple that 
better off if you separate them and so i started to question that and that became an interesting period 
my life because i ended up talking to surgeons who were doing conjoined twin separations who started to hear 
my work and read my work and began to ask the question i really which i really appreciated that 
would ask that question i really not all of them were thoughtful i remember when i was talking i 
hear him opening his mail in the background while having this discussion about whether or gonna separate these two 
who were joined at the head who i was sure he was gonna kill so not all of them 
so sensitive and sensible but many of them were sc very sobering how deeply ingrained this idea is that 
want other people to become normal by our lights rather than asking them what they want this kind of 
relationship is a little bit different but everyone grows old right and people get sent to assisted care facilities 
centers and whatever and studies have shown that the elderly really would like to have much more autonomy than 
give them well we try to give them the safety the caregivers or whatever try to protect them and 
tend to want to do risky things to give them a feeling of freedom but we want to let 
not exactly the same set of issues but the same human desire to sort of control other lives and 
them normal by our own standards ad we do the same thing with people with disabilities and we do 
same thing with children and a real problem because in all those circumstances you think helping but if you 
bother to listen to the people whose lives limiting they often do not feel helping they feel that you 
oppressing them so i think it is something that we have to think about much more carefully certainly for 
there are circumstances of course where people are in nursing care facilities who still wanna have sex and we 
the attitude that part of your life is well why the heck should that part of your life be 
right sc yeah ad and for adults with disabilities including cognitive disabilities many of them do still wanna have 
to sex or access to going out and having a good time and so the independent living movement within 
disability rights community has been very positive in that way but been a lot of defunding of a lot 
systems that allow independent living and certainly for children we infantilize our children for a very very long time 
compared to other nations the united states for example has much higher drinking ages is slower to permit things 
control of your own medical decisionmaking many places you could be younger and make decisions about your own medical 
before you can in the united states age of consent is lower in terms of many other places so 
are many ways in which i think we just infantilize our children in this country in ways that do 
empower them and also really protect them because the fact is and and will do what they will do 
and claiming sc well that reality to deal with yeah ad yeah no so my own feeling is that 
important to empower your kids i i mean more recently i wrote a book about talking to your kids 
sex because a few years ago my son invited me to his sex ed class where they were teaching 
which he knows drives me up the wall and i ended up livetweeting it which became viral so then 
was asked to write a book about talking to your kids about sex so a book called and in 
i just sort of modelled what i have done in my own parenting which is trying to take seriously 
as real people in the world and to address their actual questions with real answers not nambypamby around stuff 
the truth sc yeah kind of amazing to me sex and death two of the very fundamental features of 
life and yet two of the things that at least out there socially afraid to talk about as grownups 
sort of nervously teeter about this or that and get a laugh but the idea of just sort of 
about it as a real thing going to happen and be honest about it and even with children or 
elderly just remarkably hard for the society to catch on to ad it is and this leads naturally into 
conversation of how i got in trouble by doing the history of that controversy over transgenderism part of what 
was doing was i was taking seriously the idea that transgenderism also implicates issues of sexuality and for many 
people in the transgender rights understandably kind of desexualized transgenderism made it all about gender never about sex even 
one of the things that often happens for people who are transgender is they change their genitals so it 
something to do with sex right it has something to do with selfpresentation and genital feeling how you wanna 
in terms of your sexual encounters but a lot of the mainstream wanna talk about sex just as they 
talk about death ad and so to push for transgender rights it became necessary to sort of desexualize it 
like when gay lesbian people were actively working on marriage equality they often stopped talking about sexuality they talked 
adopting children and about cooking dinner together and watching tv together but nobody was mentioning happening in terms of 
because the straight population is more comfortable with the idea that not gonna talk about sex and so easier 
access your rights in that way ad and so this controversy that i got into had to do with 
particular area of sexuality studies around transgender where i was looking at transgender women who transition because of sexual 
issues and this was extremely dicey a thing to talk about politically and so the researchers that i was 
the history of got attacked for talking about this and then i became attacked as well for having tracked 
what happened to those researchers when they crossed the line sc so in particular the idea that at least 
people who want to transition from male to female do so because they find it sexually arousing or sexually 
or part of their motivation not all people and not the only motivation but at least there ad right 
for some people transition it just about gender identity also about sexual orientation and i think that should be 
surprising because i think for many of us our sexual orientations are connected to our gender identities so when 
sex as a woman i think doing it as a woman paused to think about it sometimes interested intellectually 
this question but i think for a lot of us when our gender feelings become most vivid is actually 
having sex so i think anything unusual in that a transgender person might have that interaction going for themselves 
well in terms of their orientation and their gender identity but to talk about that was to be seen 
going back to a really nasty old conversation about transgenderism that saw it merely as a fetish and merely 
a kink and merely as something that was sort of something perverted and inappropriate and not what these researchers 
saying they were saying this is actually a legitimate way to be and they would say absolutely no reason 
deny people access to transition because of this just sometimes sexuality is part of the equation not to sc 
lot of interesting material for your tinder profile here i laughter ad some of the researchers said these things 
ways that were sort of cold or even outrightly offensive and so how they got in trouble but what 
to one of them michael bailey is what i traced in the book middle finger and that was that 
was beset upon by a group of transgender activists who basically made up a whole bunch of lies about 
and when i came to that part of my research and i decided to look into i knew people 
both sides of this controversy i was rather curious to know what really had happened i really like questions 
like been told one thing and everything else seems to be true so i looked into that for about 
year i looked to a thousand sources and interviewed about a hundred people and at the end of it 
i found was that the charges about bailey were simply made up and that the people who had made 
probably knew that these were false charges but had basically tried to just shut him up because they want 
view of transgenderism getting out into the popular realm so when i did that they came after me and 
was very very very unpleasant and that was in around two thousand eight when it was easier because of 
to take over a identity and what occurred ad and actually tell you so literally yesterday i was going 
a local coffee shop that i go to a lot and the woman who owns it came up to 
and said i was wondering if we could have coffee some time i said sure of course be happy 
have coffee with and she said to me people are telling me that you hate transgender and i was 
my and this this traces back all the way to that stuff and this claim out there that i 
hate transgender people even though agitated for transgender rights in sports worked on national projects to improve the care 
medical care of people who are transgender i mean but what happens is if people want to defame you 
the social media world as it exists today it can happen pretty easily and then it takes on a 
of its own and people and cannot figure out true about you so and what can i do right 
whole bunch of stuff out there online about me simply not true and nothing i could do about it 
and this showed up on your webpage you had the very vivid story of what you recently gave a 
welsley was it ad yes mmhmm sc certain opinions about you have been shared and people came with protests 
as far as you could tell they were protesting a completely different person than you would think of yourself 
which is a very surreal thing when spent your whole life studying the relationship between anatomy and identity and 
there bodily standing there right in your own flesh and people are yelling at you about an identity that 
swear is yours that you recognize at all ad a very strange experience and the picture i put up 
that moment where i faced these hundredsomething people young people protesting me only protesting a version of me i 
just standing there listening to them and thinking to myself like do you even begin to get a foothold 
because at the end of the day their politics and my politics i think exactly align but they think 
sc what i what i felt very strongly when reading middle finger this sense of heartbreak in some sense 
you and the people who are coming to attack you in some sense want what is best for transgender 
neither of you are trying to shut them down or not let them live their lives but there is 
mismatch because you are trying to be an intellectual be a scholar trying to say what is the truth 
the situation as best we understand it right now and of course always subject to change if more studies 
along or whatever and they have a certain strategy for winning a fight for justice that they think that 
particular point of view that you say might be right gets in the way of and almost an impossible 
to address in some sensible way ad it is and i mean largely given up on that front and 
talked to other people who unfortunately have done the same the good news is a lot of really fine 
now who are working on changing the system within medicine for transgender issues there are a lot of terrific 
working on the legal and social issues there are a lot of people in politics changing the laws so 
progress happening and why i feel like needed too much but it is nevertheless disappointing that we have conversations 
go beyond sort of screaming around about who is a bigot and who is not a bigot and it 
feels very frustrating but the whole social media experience on everything these days so this area is not special 
that way just a little disconcerting when somebody known for years has heard that a nazi basically and feels 
need to ask you you a and like gonna tell you not a but my proof what is so 
sc just what a nazi would say ad i know exactly right no and so i brought a stack 
my books and like hate to give you a lot of homework but gonna give you what actually written 
what actually done and if you wanna look at it you can look at so i gave her a 
stack of stuff and said is what actually written and actually said and some of it does irritate some 
but i think if you read it not gonna find any evidence here that i as people have claimed 
send intersex people to the gas chambers or want to stop people from transitioning who will benefit from none 
that is true a very surreal situation sc kind of the flip side of this human desire to categorize 
like either male or your full stop either an ally or an full stop if an enemy the worst 
of enemy all you could possibly ad mmhmm you have it exactly right and always sucked at categories ad 
mean i i mean look at like what i study right always been interested in people who fit categories 
in that sense i think something always related to i you know i was at the top of my 
in high school i was not supposed to be a college dropout you know i got tenure early i 
not supposed to give up tenure but not satisfied with the categories i find it interesting to live in 
categories so why the people i study often are people who are challenging those categories whether intentionally or unintentionally 
their bodies but it does drive me crazy i keep running up against people who wanna say are you 
or are you and like recognize that set of like you think any other way to be in the 
for example i mean a progressive but i run a nonprofit nonpartisan newspaper now for east lansing michigan which 
where we live and there are people who wanna say to me like understand it a progressive but taking 
and my attitude is should i not be interested in the thoughts and the actions of people who are 
like right but very very frustrating sc but the thing about these categories is that they are in some 
is a landscape of where you can live intellectually and gravity pulls us down to some certain valleys and 
the categories live so this makes you literally sisyphus trying to constantly push the ball back up the hill 
try to say all sorts of places you could ad well and i hate to sound like anticapitalist not 
anticapitalist but i will say money does matter here again so if you are online the way that people 
make money off of you is if you feel strongly about categories so if they can convince you that 
particular brand is absolutely the type of running shoe that you want or the type of underwear you want 
the type of politician you want or the type of law you want whatever it is if they can 
you that you have a particular category that is the only category you want they will figure out ways 
monetize that so when we look at places that are conventional newspapers they have largely become opinion pages because 
pages cause people to click and clicking means that you can sell out ad so there is a strong 
in our world today towards convincing people to be narrowminded being broadminded is not a good way to sell 
getting people to be narrowminded is a very good way to sell products because they will narrow what it 
gonna choose and pay more because not very much in that category so they will pay more to purchase 
that category and how we end up in the situation we do politically in terms of the undermining of 
becoming pure opinion pages how we got here and really problematic so if you go on youtube and you 
on what you like on youtube draw you down in ever more particular path because when you end up 
the ads if actually pretty broad and you click on this and that and not really interested in number 
views and just watching whatever no money to be made off of you but there is money to be 
off of you if we can convince you are really into x and not into sc so i conclude 
this that you are a rabid anticapitalist and you would like to collectivize the farms and institute fiveyear plans 
a logical consequence of what you just said ad yeah with my retirement money invested in wall street yeah 
yeah no i mean i know how to solve that problem other than trying to convince people that living 
categories is actually not very interesting or satisfying but that said i will recognize much more comfortable with change 
ambiguity than most people are and so i think part of what we have to do is think about 
can we cultivate a value of volatility and ambiguity among our populace and make them realize it have to 
scary but a lot of people are very scared of ambiguity but they have to be sc i think 
think it is scary i think not gonna get rid of the scariness i think that the best you 
hope to do is to say embrace the scariness of it all ad i think right and there are 
to what we can embrace i mean when we have a bat in the house ad every now then 
get a bat in the house we live part of michigan we had big trees in our neighborhood and 
means we have a lot of bats and every now then we get a bat in the house and 
is this otherworldly sense of ambiguity that there is some creature that will not communicate with us that is 
our space and we have to figure out where the hell it just went and get it out and 
is the moment which i realized i am not comfortable with certain kinds of ambiguity ad i am not 
when another creature that will not communicate with me that is in my space it freaks me the hell 
and so yeah no we all have our limits and not different from people that way i mean i 
have my limits in terms of the ambiguity i can tolerate sc well one sentence in middle finger that 
thought really pinpointed for better or for worse the dilemma that is faced by people who would like both 
and justice in the world you say know of any successful rights movement that based on an essentialized shared 
even if just constructed in politically expedient so kind of pinpointing the difference between this anticategory live in fear 
complexity and the subtlety of the world intellectual point of view and the idea that well we wanna make 
world a better place we wanna improve things and maybe that means bringing people under an umbrella of a 
shared identity even if not a completely perfect fit to how to the world actually is ad yeah no 
are times when very useful to do that i mean we do that as families for example right the 
we define who is in the family or is not in the family will depend on the immediate need 
the kin and change the boundaries on that as necessary we do that within our own communities whether if 
threat for example communities may form that are not logically their own communities but form temporarily in response to 
threat so certainly we all do that and the challenge to me is how do we not make the 
of that so strong that we be flexible and allow change to occur when time for change to occur 
that can be really difficult sc up to a couple days ago i was a huge lebron james fan 
it looked like he might join the philadelphia which is the best basketball team in the world but now 
the lakers so i think a terrible terrible person and the enemy what can i do sorry in the 
tribe ad change with the sport you watch i know laughter sc no i do that ad no still 
that category sc oh yeah no not very happily in the category of crazy phil w fan who thinks 
all other teams are morally failures but you stop you despite the transgender controversy and the emotional toll it 
taken i am a conflictaverse person i think i could have stood up to what you had to put 
with but managed to get into a couple of new controversies since then there was the maria new controversy 
not gonna say it right dexamethasone steroids is that right ad oh you said it right yes yeah that 
to the intersex rights work so this is a researcher a physician the short version of it was that 
was convincing women at risk for having daughters born with intersex genitals to take a steroid when they were 
with these fetuses and to try to prevent the intersex development and the problem with it was not only 
this was ending up affecting fetuses who could not benefit because only seven out of eight of the pregnancies 
would actually involve a child of that type the bigger problem was she was telling the families that this 
been found safe for mother and child when in fact she was at the same time getting money from 
national institute of health claiming that she needed to study these families to see if it was safe or 
so she was using the same population she had brought in with a sales pitch that it was safe 
say i need grant money to see if this had been and that was extremely disturbing to me from 
ethics point of view and a moral point of view sc and this was not some fringe figure like 
grand lady of the field right ad a member of the national academy of sciences a highly distinguished pediatric 
one of the top people in her field yeah so i tried to get the government to intervene in 
case with a bunch of colleagues and that failed the government function very well in certain ways ad shocker 
the government protect you like supposed to protect you sc never before has this been realized ad exactly so 
took a couple years off my life both at the time and probably at the end of my life 
little shave off a few years i got into a fight with the food and drug administration with the 
journal of bioethics and the medical schools of cornell and mount sinai i have to tell this is another 
why i think if we can go back to the beginning of our conversation why i think i fit 
the intellectual dark web because a lot of those people spend a lot of their time sort of dealing 
hotbutton controversy issues out in the mainstream i dig my feet in a lot of the time and take 
small but i think morally deeply important projects and work on them for years and the kind of stuff 
do is hardcore historical investigations i take on projects that literally take years at a time in order to 
to figure out what happened and to try to bring some justice and so i just think those people 
doing that doing a different kind of political punditry that i do a little bit of political punditry but 
lot of what i do is hardcore research in historical areas involving science and medicine sc yeah a few 
ago john brockman has these collections these edge questions of the year that he then collects into books and 
a literary agent he asks his stable of writers to write something pithy and small in response to some 
and the question was what have you changed your mind about and changed my mind about a million things 
most of them be that interesting so what i wrote up was a heretic is hard and i ad 
sc well being a good heretic right being a heretic at all is actually no work whatsoever and i 
that when i was a college student and i was first learning about physics and so forth i had 
romantic idea of having some heterodox view of mainstream physics and i was going overthrow to it and change 
world and having a view that is both correct and widely disparaged is really hard you have to do 
lot of work easy to just be contrarian hard to do the dirty work of establishing the truth of 
that is not considered to be already pretty obvious ad exactly and i mean i also find that work 
satisfying because maybe gonna show that i was raised catholic very thankless and i really like that about it 
not doing it for any kind of conventional reward system really doing it hardcore work to me like when 
go running and not a natural runner but when i go running and i push myself really hard and 
with me and not tracking the run or anything just doing it hard i really like that and i 
a lot of intellectuals are like that where they really like a difficult problem and they really wanna tackle 
and where by the way a lot of activists are very different from intellectuals because i think a lot 
activists really want the easy way out if they could flip a switch and get what they wanted they 
do it i would never be interested in flipping a switch if i understand what was behind the switch 
what all the implications are of flipping the switch and can i think about the unintended consequences can i 
through that and can i figure out what the switch you know like you i i really really wanna 
my feet into it but that it it is really hard work sc well the categories of activistintellectual are 
to straddle equally right i think they both are important important to make the world a better place important 
find the truth and be objective about it but one tends to have a value that is more important 
if an intellectual if finding the truth regardless of its consequences is the most important thing to you then 
leads you to certain practices and certain things that gonna consider to be enjoyable and having a good time 
it might not be the same as those who are juiced up by the activist lifestyle by just changing 
world for the sake of changing the world the world needs to be changed ad yeah i think right 
need both but they often feel very different there are i mean there are pockets of places where people 
intellectuals and activists and those to me are very exciting places for example the aclu at its best is 
place that joins intellectualism and activism a lot of legal groups where really cool stuff happens but then also 
medical activist groups for example some of the medical groups around trying to bring evidencebased clinical practice into being 
for example the lon institute that tries to look at what we really know in terms of the data 
tries to avoid overintervention over treatment in medicine and tries to pull back and say need to overmedicate we 
to send too many people in for procedures that actually those kinds of places i think that join that 
intellectualism with a real activist strategy of trying to improve lives those are really exciting places sc well you 
in the chronicle piece that despite the fact that you are no longer strictly speaking a professor you love 
professoriate academia walking across the college campus a space that is kind of unique in our culture where trying 
figure out hard questions and answer them deeply is valued but nevertheless you quit your job you had a 
faculty job so why you tell us that story ad so after i gave up tenure i was working 
michigan state university where i got tenure my friends at medical school in the program of medical humanities and 
offered me a longdistance parttime job which i took i had a big name by then and they were 
in having my company and having my name and in exchange i would have their name and it would 
be lovely and it was i loved my colleagues there and i ended up working there for ten years 
job sort of swelled and set back depending on what was needed in terms of my home life i 
raising a kid at home two hundred hundred miles from my job at the same time so it all 
on like did i have a big speaking year if i had a big speaking year i laid back 
the northwestern job et cetera et cetera ad so about a year and a half before i ended up 
up that job i was asked to edit the annual magazinejournal of our department which is a journal called 
atrium published short intense interesting pieces that were on a particular theme for each issue so these are medical 
themes so we had themes like power and the liminal and good and evil i mean these are interesting 
within medicine and we would invite people to submit proposals in terms of what they wanted to write and 
people were physicians or historians of medicine or philosophers or bioethicists or nurses or patients whoever it was you 
submit on the theme and we would choose a certain number of them and publish them a very highgloss 
production and we edited it very carefully it was very wellrespected it was subscribed to by the people and 
was also read very widely online for free ad so the year i was invited to be the editor 
it the theme that the editorinchief chose was bad girls which was perfect it was about gender it was 
morality stuff i do so i we put together a call for proposals as a group and sent it 
as we always did and people sent me about thirtythree different proposals and out of that we could pick 
thirteen of them and one of them i chose was a piece by a cultural anthropologist named william peace 
syracuse university and bill peace was writing about his own experience he does culture anthropology and disability studies and 
was born with a neurological condition that meant when he was eighteen years old he became paralyzed from the 
down and he was in a longterm rehabilitation facility at that point and he was wondering about his own 
this was in the late and you know it was the sexual revolution he is a young man he 
to have sex of course someday he wants to be a father so asking his doctors about this and 
of them are really willing to talk with him about it ad so he talks about the fact that 
this institution where basically these men were there for a very long time and they got to know the 
really well and sometimes there were relationships that blossomed between nurses and patients in this circumstance this was not 
a hospital it like people you just meet once and then disappearing these are people they knew for months 
years at a time and in his circumstance he tells the story in this piece that i published where 
night he was thinking he finally got bladder control and he wet the bed again and was very depressed 
crying and he hits the nurse call button and this nurse that he had become very close friends with 
and basically she reassured him by giving him oral sex and he writes about it as a moment of 
and a moment which really gave him hope that he could go on to have a positive sexual life 
still makes me tear up when i write about it i think one of those moments where somebody really 
out to you and meets you where you are ad and sure enough he did go on to have 
good sex life he ended up becoming a father had a really good life and so he wrote this 
for me and part of what he was doing in this piece was asking the question do we yet 
care of the sexual needs of people who are nearly disabled are we addressing this at all and he 
this should be what should happen in rehabilitation facilities in fact he called it wild west of medicine and 
medicine which it was it was it was a very crazy period when infection control got good enough that 
were surviving at levels they never had survived before but what happened was after this was published a few 
after this was published and had gone out with a bunch of other intense articles frankly articles about transgenderism 
samoa and articles about women who give birth without a medical system articles about abortion one of which made 
really uncomfortable and prochoice very intense stuff as we always published my dean eric nielson the medical school at 
saw the issue and saw bill article and flipped out and apparently said that he was worried that it 
violate a branding agreement with hospital ad so he ordered it censored he ordered it taken down offline this 
been published this was not like he prevented it it was already published and he took a down i 
told up say anything gonna try to work this and not very good at shutting up to anything but 
was worried about my colleagues so i shut up and did nothing and then it went on and on 
on and one of my other colleagues started really questioning it that was christie kirshner a physician and a 
study scholar in rehabilitation medicine herself she had written a piece for me for that issue about women women 
disabilities and how they take back their own sexuality ad so christie was increasingly disgusted with the censorship as 
i in the middle of publishing middle finger i literally brought to the office the book jacket as it 
been designed with all these people praising me for advocating for academic freedom and here i am being censored 
my own medical school and supposed to stay quiet about this right so they keep telling me like nothing 
do about it because we pay for it so we have the right to and i just kept saying 
googled me do you know who i i cannot put up with censorship right like have spent the last 
years fighting for academic freedom and not gonna put up with so finally what happened was christie resigned and 
i ended up trying to go to the provost office and get them to reverse the decision they did 
put bill work back up but they say that it had ever been censored and they never explained why 
disappeared for a while ad they also required that from then on that the journal had to be approved 
the office and by the pr department and we would have to get permission on the themes permission on 
call for proposals permission on what we were gonna publish they were gonna approve everything and not academic freedom 
the least so i put up with that so i resigned quite publicly over it and called them out 
it and they never disagreed with my version of the events in public they never challenged it they basically 
that what i was saying was true and they never apologized for it so clearly that was the wrong 
for me to be so in the great sweep of irony if you if you know who chief rival 
northwestern thinks that their chief rival the other side think they should bother having a rivalship with northwestern but 
is the university of ad sc i used to be on the faculty there ad as it turns out 
my son is going in the fall as a college student and i will say that when i was 
with him last and i was walking across the green with him i was incredibly jealous of him i 
ad i was so jealous because that wonderful intellectual life that exists there is something i really do miss 
was a beautiful thing and why in that piece on the dark web i say to people are where 
need to be you need to be in the dark web you should be in the light and that 
think is true sc you are kind of the taylor swift of academic controversies at some point do you 
is it you ad i think the reason i get into these things is both because kind of fearless 
i mind being uncomfortable a little bit but the other thing is that articulate and when articulate and willing 
fight that gets you in a lot of trouble so in the book middle finger i talk about the 
personality and not to say anywhere near of the intellect galileo is but it is to say i have 
similar personality to him as do the other people i track in the book who get in trouble and 
is this personality type that is unafraid of fighting when they believe that something they know to be true 
being denied they will fight and fight and fight to try to get people to see what they see 
there are people who believe that eventually the truth will save them and stupid that way not going to 
yeah ad the book is named after a literal digit of galileo his middle finger which is mounted on 
stone pillar under a glass jar pointing forever more at the heavens that is in the galileo museum in 
and to me a story of like well yeah technically he won but look left of it right like 
middle finger pointing to the sky laughter ad he died under house arrest it sucked the truth is it 
so the reality sc confess i was one of the people that your publisher worried about i thought that 
book was about galileo when i saw the cover and the title because i knew about the finger i 
been in florence and jennifer my wife had gone to the museum and was raving about this little relic 
of the closest we have ad it is really cool sc secular version of the catholic relics of the 
right ad it is sc ad fantastic i love the relic and i tell the story in the book 
when i came upon it in graduate school i just started laughing hysterically i thought it was so incredibly 
right that of all the things left of galileo we have his middle finger pointing up at the sky 
was just so incredibly funny but also a metaphor for just so much you can do as an individual 
mean there is just so much you can do as an individual you have to hope that you can 
people to look with you at what is true and if right then they will find what you found 
there be mass hysteria find what you find sc and one of many virtues was that in some sense 
was a public intellectual in our current sense right he ad he was sc in the vernacular he tried 
reach people other than his academic colleagues just sort of finishing up here how do you view the role 
the public intellectual these days i know that in science there is a whole separate category of science popularizers 
who write books and have tv shows and so forth and if you write a book or appear on 
tv show that popularizes science then certain segments that remove you from the list of active intellectuals doing work 
clearly gone over to a different side and the idea that both doing research and doing your work and 
to reach a bigger audience is not a category that they quite accept but i suspect that in the 
a little bit more established that this is something we can at least aspire to do ad no i 
the same suspicion guessing talking about yourself running into it since you like to take both sides sc no 
i know personally but heard of people this has happened to ad asking for a friend asking for a 
yeah sc yeah asking for a friend ad so yeah no there is that bias and always assumed what 
really is is jealousy that some form of you can do that but you do what i do and 
fact there are people there are some people who can do both really really well and i think really 
if they do both really well and you know is it the case that some people dumb stuff down 
much in order to sell books yes and regretful and that should not happen but there are some folks 
stick with it stay in the field they actually know wander into fields they have no clue what talking 
and some of the stuff that comes out of that is really very good i try hard when contacted 
newspapers or broadcast venues or whatever it is and they say to me want you to talk about x 
speak so clearly on and i say them not really my field you need to talk to this person 
that and always surprised but my own feeling is if gonna do public intellectualism well we should be very 
to talk about what it is we actually know and where the danger zone comes in is when you 
people who are wandering into fields that they really know what talking about that is not good for intellectualism 
becomes mere punditry sc it does seem ad easy to do that too though because the places will let 
publish wherever you want they need content now because of the internet they need so much content so much 
published sc and they know who to ask in my field there is the famous example of bill nye 
science guy showing up on cnn as an expert on climate change they fired all their real science reporters 
they were left with and bill extraordinarily articulate and a good champion of science he knows nothing about climate 
certainly not a researcher in that field so i have mixed feelings like good for him but he could 
said no and pointed them at somebody who was a better choice ad and there are plenty of people 
are very articulate yeah sc yeah exactly worth making a little bit of an effort if there are news 
out there but i think hardened maybe reading in so you should verify or fix this misimpression after all 
this after all the controversies after all the backandforth you still seem to cling to something that seems like 
optimistic view of the intersection or union of being an intellectual and being an activist of seeking both truth 
justice hard not linear but worth the fight is that fair to say ad yeah i think that is 
called myself a bitter optimist yeah no i think right i like doing intellectual work but i also feel 
we have a limited amount of time on earth and we should spend that trying to help improve the 
of others as we are able sc i think a perfect place to stop alice dreger thanks so much 
joining us on the podcast music mindscape is my new favorite podcast thank you for spending the time and 
doing this every episode so far has been amazingly informative thought provoking and enjoyable keep up the great work 
woman great listen regarding the discussion starting around about the idea that some people transition from male to female 
part because they find it sexually arousing i have not read book but i am familiar with the controversy 
general and i thought write a few notes to help people better understand the background for more information i 
this video in the podcast carroll and dreger are quick to emphasise and but the same is not true 
the researchers dreger is talking about and whose voices she is critised for amplifying they really do argue that 
the case of male to female transitioners who are attracted to women sexual arousal at the thought of being 
is the dominant motivation and have a history of insinuating that people are lyingdeluded when they report that their 
experience says otherwise if we dismiss the universality claim that the typology accounts for all or most transitioners in 
relevant category that leaves us with the causality claim that the relationship between sexual arousal at the thought of 
a woman and the decision to transition is a causalmotivational one this can be contrasted with the idea that 
might stem from a common cause these two claims universality and causality are what people find so offensive and 
the fact that some people do experience arousal at the thought of being a member of the opposite sex 
well established and i should know but this comment is not about me a partial correlation with gender dysphoria 
hence the decision to transition is also well established it is even sometimes the case that a earliest awakenings 
gender dysphoric feelings take the form of exactly this type of arousal all these things are openly discussed within 
of the transgender community but do not indicate that the arousal is what motivates the transition the alternative explanation 
both when present stem from a common cause respects the reported experiences of transgender people themselves it is also 
unlikely that arousal could be primary motivation to transition because given the way hormones mess with the libido even 
one started out with that motivation one would need another to see it through dreger herself hints at a 
relationship when she says think that should be that surprising because i think for a lot of us when 
gender feelings become most vivid is actually when having sex so i think anything unusual in that a transgender 
might have that interaction going for themselves as precisely so and if you listen to transgender rebuttals of the 
dreger describes they often make very similar points but dreger does not acknowledge that it is a rebuttal because 
does not seem to understand that the causality claim along with the universality claim is at the heart of 
controversy the research dreger mentions is extremely shoddy scientifically one way in which it is shoddy is the lack 
a control group and another is that in the case of trans women arousal connected with the thought of 
a is defined so broadly as to be unfalsifiable whereas the same standard is not applied to cis women 
all that would be the mythical control group i am reliably informed that arousal associated with thoughts of being 
sexy woman is common among cis women as well even if as expect it is manifest differently i hope 
helps people get a broader perspective on the controversy discussed in the podcast and the video i linked to 
fill in a few gaps thanks adrian that background is useful pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast alice dreger on 
truth and justice three quarks daily kudos sean for being a pleasant and gracious host and yet still willing 
ask challenging questions like after your wellspoken guest talked for a while about her natural resistance to categorization you 
from her book that political advocacy requires an identified constituency great to have smart guests but even better when 
ask those guests smart and insightful questions based on real study of their work thanks again and looking forward 
future episodes colleague michael bailey was set upon by a some radical transgender activists that made up a bunch 
lies about so i looked into it because i really like things where we are all told one thing 
all the evidence says its not it turned out that they knew they were lying to discredit him and 
his ideas from getting out into the so when i did that they came after me it was really 
is if people want to defame you on social media its really easy it takes on a life of 
own and then people figure out true about you and what can i do there is a bunch of 
out there about me not true and i do anything about and then you draw large protest crowds at 
speaking events its a very surreal there in your own flesh and people are yelling at you about an 
they swear is yours that you recognize at welcome to the intellectual dark web alice dreger she thinks the 
unifying principle is about trolling liberals or something no its about being lied about at having your character smeared 
defamed by radical activists because the easily verifiable truths you speak somehow threaten the myths of an utterly antiempirical 
they hold and the irony is that most of the dark webbers getting attacked are liberals themselves speaking for 
principles of equal rights and antioppression while their radical defamers are unwittingly acting on the behalf of the far 
and the theocrats i wish you could have at least gently guided her back to think this of a 
is what they mean by the intellectual dark web alice but just semantics please apart from that nitpick i 
love the new podcast sean i have been a super fan of your since the release of from here 
eternity the big picture is one of my all time favorites and is my all time favorite book just 
so slightly edging out max mathematical universe neither of us can wait for the new one to drop keep 
the fantastic work ever since we heard you school sam harris about mixing terminology from different as it applies 
free will and moral responsibility we were both like seriously needs his own comments are closed sean carroll hosts
