does it mean to be a good person to act ethically and morally in the world in the old 
we might appeal to the instructions we get from god but a modern naturalist has to look elsewhere today 
do a rare solo podcast where i talk about my personal views on morality a variety of according to 
human beings construct their ethical stances starting from basic impulses logical reasoning and communicating with others in light of 
view i consider two realworld examples of contemporary moral controversies is it morally permissible to eat meat or is 
an ethical imperative to be a vegetarian do inequities in society stem from discrimination or from the natural order 
things as a jumpingoff point i take the looseknit group known as the intellectual dark web which includes jordan 
sam harris ben shapiro and others and their nemeses the social justice warriors though the discussion is about broader 
not just that group of folks probably everyone will agree with my takes on these issues once they listen 
my eminently reasonable arguments actually this is a more conversational exploratory episode rather than a polished tightlyargued case from 
to finish i claim to have all the final answers the hope is to get people thinking and conversing 
to settle things once and for all these issues are on the one hand very tricky and none of 
should be too certain that we have everything figured out on the other hand they can get very personal 
consequently emotions run high the issues are important enough that we have to talk about them and we can 
least aspire to do so in the most reasonable way possible support mindscape on patreon or paypal click to

way possible support mindscape on patreon or paypal click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome 
the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today going to have another solo podcast that is to say 
episode of mindscape with only me talking i think that when i started mindscape which was very close to 
year ago i think close to the anniversary not sure what it is but i had in mind be 
more than once every year solo episodes but the truth is i just had too many interesting people to 
to so had wonderful guests coming to my horizon and been a lot of fun talking to them so 
regrets there but i do wanna mix in some more solo episodes so i made an effort to record 
one sc the last one of course was a very different one in the sense that i had written 
paper on why is there something rather than nothing for a scholarly collection of essays and i could basically 
through the arguments in that paper and explain them it was kind of figured out already it was a 
sensible work today i both want to be a little bit more controversial but also be a bit more 
that is to say talk about something where i have a complete polished argument so more of a conversational 
the cuff ruminating about things trying to get some thoughts into minds including my own so thinking out loud 
it were but i will be a little bit controversial so i wanna talk about what it means to 
a good person or in slightly more formal language how should we think about morality and ethics what is 
what is wrong sc in particular a naturalist i believe in god or the supernatural so how should naturalists 
about morality of course i did organize a whole workshop a few years ago on moving naturalism forward got 
bunch of people together so rather the idea there was rather than argue about god not existing which we 
agreed on by the construction of who was in the room we start with god not existing and we 
ourselves what various things that happen when religious various roles that are played by religion in lives how do 
replace them sc there are a lot of issues facing naturalists how to find meaningfulness in your life the 
of free will and consciousness and other programs within science that are not yet complete but clearly one of 
big issues is morality how do you be a good person what sets the standards for right and wrong 
is something about which naturalists disagree and i think good that naturalists disagree in the sense that we are 
for the right answer and we yet found it or at least some of us might have found it 
the interpretation of quantum mechanics some of us might know the right answers but we agree amongst ourselves so 
discussing to be done sc as i am discussing this as talking to you right now recording this podcast 
had a wave of laws being passed in multiple states in the united states dramatically restricting access to abortion 
criminalizing abortion abortion is of course a classic moral dilemma kind of problem people come down on different sides 
it for very different reasons i think a lot of i agree with the argument that says that a 
of people who oppose abortion rights oppose a right to choose do so because they like restricting choices because 
simply a tool of oppressing women and expressing their individuality and agency but not everyone opposes abortion for those 
i certainly know people who simply in good faith because of their religious beliefs think that abortion is wrong 
think that something that happens when an egg is fertilized by a sperm and when you become a person 
that person deserves rights sc this is again not necessarily the political reason why abortion is a controversy but 
is something that an argument you can make what should naturalists think about this if you think that anything 
or supernatural or religious or spiritual that happens at the moment of conception then you have a whole different 
of issues in front of you and concerning whether or not abortion should be legal on the other hand 
do think that most naturalists have the same answer to that question not a hard question for naturalists a 
cell even if that cell is a fertilized egg most naturalists would not attribute many rights to so most 
are gonna say that women should be able to get abortions at least for a certain period of their 
sc what about the hard problems there are plenty of hard problems the death penalty what we should do 
end of life how we should distribute money in society what is fair and so forth trolley problems are 
moral dilemmas that we can wrestle with so i wanna talk about a couple of things that are a 
bit or a little bit less obvious i should say for the naturalist i wanna give my general feelings 
them which are immediately themselves provisional not trying to talk about things for which i think i know the 
answer sc and rather than simply focus on broad principles and abstract reasoning i wanna bring things down to 
with a couple of examples that people have strong feelings about i picked two examples one example is vegetarianism 
it ethically okay to eat meat to eat animals and animal products this is something that has come up 
occasionally on the podcast and also on my ask me anything special podcast on patreon if a patreon supporter 
know that every month i do an ask me anything when all supporters can ask questions and i try 
answer as many of them as i can see how i cleverly work the existence of the patreon in 
if you wanna go to patreoncomseanmcarroll or just go to the podcast web page you can find the link 
be a patreon patron yeah be a patron yourself sc so okay not a vegetarian but i understand i 
why some people would become a vegetarian i think a very very good example of a moral dilemma facing 
not obvious whether we should eat meat or not so i will talk about that and then the second 
gonna talk about is exemplified by the intellectual dark web this is something that you might have heard about 
a group of people sam harris jordan peterson ben shapiro other people many of them are bloggers and podcasters 
they have a certain take on things that i really agree with not a sort of intellectual dark web 
in some ways i am and so when i started the podcast people were asking me whether i was 
a member of the intellectual dark web not many people not people who knew me very well the particular 
that they talk a lot about in the intellectual dark web are issues of social justice racism sexism and 
forth with the angle that the people who are social justice warriors the people who are spending a lot 
their time arguing that too much racism and sexism and transphobia and homophobia in our culture and we need 
do something about that have gone too far and in particular gone too far in squelching debate and being 
to the enlightenment values of open discussion and free speech sc so i want to talk about that and 
why i am not very sympathetic with their overall attitude so hopefully between having a whole bunch of committed 
disagree with me and a whole bunch of intellectual dark web supporters disagree with me i will have annoyed 
pissed off a large swath of the listenership here the goal or at least to get people thinking i 
that i am thoughtful enough and openminded enough that even if a little bit annoyed i try to give 
some interesting things to think about like i said my particular ideas here are not completely settled but important 
we have these conversations especially about difficult topics especially about things with which we disagree with each other so 
music sc before examining these examples in any detail i wanted to say a little bit about how i 
think about morality again not a moral philosopher myself i am not an expert in these things read a 
bit talked to people i care about the issues but not gonna be giving you the complete expert opinion 
the entire landscape of moral and ethical theory going to talk about how i think about it and invite 
to think about it yourself chime in in the comment sections in various places on the internet etcetera roughly 
when we think about morality or ethics the rules by which we live two kinds of questions we have 
talk about one is ethics itself the rules or the guidelines for how we behave how we should behave 
and then metaethics how we derive and justify what those rules are so if you have a rule you 
aim for the greatest good for the greatest part of ethics or morality but where did that come from 
should we actually aim for the greatest good for the greatest number part of metaethics and to make things 
oversimplified in ethics i find it always useful to distinguish between two different approaches to ethics or morality not 
distinguish as an expert would between ethics and morality sorry about that many different approaches to ethics and morality 
two particular examples do a very good job of illustrating kind of the space of possibilities deontology and consequentialism 
deontology is saying that morals come from a set of rules and if you write down the rules and 
obey them then be in good shape whereas consequentialists think not about this is what you should do or 
should not do what matters is what the consequences of your actions are unsurprisingly so a utilitarian who thinks 
you look for the greatest good for the greatest number that some number called utility that you can attach 
different things that could happen in the world and what you want to do is add up that number 
maximize it that would be a typical consequentialist whereas a kantian for example immanuel kant suggested the categorical imperative 
he says that you should make your own individual actions such that could be generalized to universal principles a 
deontological approach both of these approaches in my view have serious problems with them they lead us into sticky 
sc deontology runs into the problem well the same problem that every bureaucracy runs into right when you have 
bureaucracy typically well meaning you want to do something like have rules for how we drive our cars on 
road but the problem is you have to imagine that you can figure out ahead of time what every 
is in which those rules are eventually going to be applied and eventually you come up with situations where 
obvious right thing to do and the rules are telling you something different a classic example for kantians is 
idea of lying not even sure what kant himself believed about this because i think if there is controversy 
not an but the idea that you should never lie because if you were obeying the categorical imperative then 
is not something you want to be generalized to an action that everyone should take but what if hiding 
refugee in your house and a murderer wants to come and murder them right should you tell the murderer 
the person hiding from them is in the basement or should you lie and say something else so easy 
not maybe easy but at least very often possible to come up with apparent counterexamples to the deontological rules 
people generally suggest sc when it comes to consequentialism of course it depends on your version of consequentialism utilitarianism 
is a standard example so the idea that you have something called utility some number that judges or characterizes 
how good things are going and we can somehow add up that number and the thing we should try 
increase or to maximize i think sounds very intuitively compelling or plausible but it just hang together once you 
put it to work in the real world one famous example of a conclusion which you might not like 
comes from utilitarianism in fact called the repugnant conclusion by philosopher derek parfit and roughly speaking it says if 
think that most or any or all human lives have positive value that just to exist gives some positive 
or whatever it is trying to maximize then very quickly you come to the conclusion that the morally right 
to do is to just increase the number of people no matter what else right you can always do 
by having more people sc you could maximize the population of the world which sounds like not necessarily the 
right thing to do when writing my recent quantum mechanics book deeply i considered this puzzle in the light 
the many worlds interpretation i said if you were a naïve utilitarian trying to think about many worlds you 
say every time i branch the wave function of the universe into two worlds if i think that the 
of utility in each world is positive then clearly a moral good to bring new worlds into existence since 
am increasing so i invented a machine called qumad which stands for quantum utility maximizing device sc and the 
utility maximizing device qumad basically just takes a spin and bounces it back and forth as fast as possible 
its value of spin up or down across perpendicular directions and every time that happens the wave function of 
universe branches in two so you create many more people they all have positive utility or at least in 
they have positive utilities so you are the best person in the world in terms of how much extra 
creating even though literally no one in the world knows that doing anything had no effect on the lives 
anybody sc that sounds wrong right that violates our intuition now in the case of many worlds a simple 
for that just like energy conservation you can say that in fact the utility that you add up should 
multiplied by the wave function squared by the amplitude of that branch of the wave function squared so then 
you divide the universe in two even though there are now two universes the total utility change at all 
more generally that kind of thing that gets you in trouble with utilitarianism our moral intuitions necessarily fit easily 
the ideas that a number that we should maximize out there which we call the utility sc now you 
say cares why should i care about that what difference does it make if my moral intuitions come into 
with some systematic version of what is right and what is if i have a moral system if i 
it out in my mind of the once and for all correct rules of ethics and morality then the 
that my intuitions or natural impulses go into conflict with that should be completely irrelevant my intuitions might be 
the system is right right a little bit of a sticky situation though i think the origin of coming 
with the idea that we should maximize utility or that we should act in a way that other people 
act and so forth all of these eventually come from our moral intuitions sc we pick these things randomly 
there is some place that they originate from and i think that our moral intuitions are it so think 
that a little bit more carefully that means moving to the metaethical question right why are we justifying these 
in the first place and again an enormous amount of categorization and specific theories in this field that not 
go into but we can contrast very roughly realism versus antirealism in morality right and that basically gives the 
you might expect a moral realist thinks that moral claims like this action is good or this action is 
or real real in the same sense that tables and chairs and atoms and the expansion of the universe 
all real objectively there roughly speaking sc whereas an antirealist either might not believe in morality at all or 
that there is morality but somehow subjective that morality is a human construct that could be different could either 
have been different for different societies or could literally be different for different people in the same society so 
is a very good question a very deep question and one that is nowhere near resolved as far as 
can tell within the philosophical community i think that according to a famous survey of different philosophers and their 
about different nutty philosophical issues the philpapers survey most philosophers are more realists they think that there really are 
rules that objectively exist in some sense sc i personally am not at the very very least i would 
claim that whatever moral strictures are whatever moral guidelines are moral rules whatever they exist they have reality in 
same sense that tables and chairs have reality maybe that some different sense of reality that they have be 
willing to contemplate that possibility but they have reality in the same way not part of the physical universe 
precisely the same way again completely presuming for all of this discussion that naturalism is correct i cannot appeal 
god or any supernatural being to tell me what is right and what is wrong even if i could 
runs into famous problems that were pointed out by plato and others but for me i just have the 
universe right sc the universe is what exists real and in that universe i see any moral stances any 
rules i see stuff obeying the laws of physics now you may have heard on certain corners of the 
that we should be able to derive moral rules from the universe the idea of deriving ought from is 
you ought to do from what is actually happening out there in the world and also sympathetic to this 
some sense right i mean my best glib argument that you should be able to derive ought from is 
all that i just said that i just believe the a universe exists right what is real and nothing 
that is real other than the universe so if going to talk about oughts about moral rules where else 
they come from but from the universe but from what actually is sc but sadly that work there is 
option which is to say that you derive moral rules from anything you can have moral rules you can 
them you can talk about them you can debate them and you can try to persuade others that they 
but not being derived from something deeper than that so it is i know that you might have heard 
had a debate with sam harris about this sam like to put it always in the terms of deriving 
but he has put it that way sometimes and i debate him just because a logical impossibility to derive 
deeper in words careful ways of saying this but basically it is as in computer science you have garbage 
garbage out in logic you have is in is out sc if you make a bunch of premises to 
deductive argument that are all about what does happen in the world you could not have a conclusion that 
this should happen in the there are a number of famous attempts to do exactly that but either well 
always they cheat put it that way either they cheat by using ambiguities in natural language to make you 
that gone from to or they smuggle in some extra assumption which has ethical power an extra assumption about 
ought to be and say look this is so obvious that clearly you accept what sam harris tries to 
he says certainly we think that the moral thing to do is to maximize misery and unhappiness for anyone 
well maybe we i want to maximize misery for everyone but that is an assumption that is not something 
derive from what is out there in the world so i just want him to state that that is 
assumption because then we can debate whether the right assumption to make the thing i disagree with is the 
that not an assumption at all so i think that you can get moral rules just by being out 
looking at the world the world have moral judgments the world care what you do right the world just 
the laws of physics if i give you the wave function of the universe it evolves over time according 
the schrodinger equation or whatever future physics we some day have no judgments there the wave function of the 
say that was a mistake to evolve in that way that was an ethically bad practice that you just 
sc it just goes on uncaring unfeeling we human beings as a part of the world once we describe 
world at a higher level of the human world the manifest image of the world where there are people 
it and those people think and reflect and act we people judge the world we attach moral meanings to 
actions or certain things going on out there in the world but not inherent in the world itself sc 
clearly a lot of other ways to be a moral realist even if you derive ought from is in 
literal sense different ways of justifying the idea that in addition to the physical reality of the world there 
once and for all objectively true moral standards not gonna go through all the different ways to do that 
sort of argue against all of them just going to put forward the idea that i think any of 
work despite the fact that this puts me in the minority of working philosophers who are much more educated 
this also a healthy minority that agree with me about this i do think that a motivation for searching 
moral realist justifications meta ethics often comes from the idea that we like certainty right and this goes back 
descartes and many other people goes way back before that the idea that we want absolutely once and for 
certain groundings for our belief descartes was interested in our belief in the physical world what we would now 
of as empirical questions are we sure not being fooled by some malevolent demon sc but very common that 
really just want to be able to say not that you not simply that you think that was wrong 
you just did but that it is objectively wrong the same kind of impulse that people have about aesthetics 
not only is this song good in the sense that i like it or i enjoy it or other 
enjoy it but is it objectively good a sense in which it is simply better once and for all 
you argue against it so i believe either one of those stances certainly again if you compare it to 
we think about science how we think about empirical questions about the world if you make a statement like 
universe is expanding when we can judge by going out there and looking but crucially it could have been 
right we can imagine a universe which was not expanding we can imagine a universe that is expanding we 
imagine one contracting we can imagine one static so we have many different possible universes and then we go 
and do observations collect data to decide which of those universes we live in sc just a completely different 
than we have for morality very few moral realists think i can imagine many different systems of ethics and 
and gonna go out and do experiments and decide which one is generally not how it works so i 
that we need to be comfortable to get ourselves happy with the idea that morality may be something important 
us but constructed constructed by human beings just like bridges are very important for human beings and constructed by 
beings as well or the game of basketball is constructed by human beings once constructed it there but not 
in the universe itself so this point of view which again not gonna do justice to all the details 
but you can find it online this goes by the name of guess what moral constructivism moral constructivism is 
the idea that what you and i take to be ethical principles are made up by human beings not 
up necessarily arbitrarily there might be good reasons to make up some rather than others but ultimately they come 
within us as judgments not from out there in the world or objective principles of reasoning or logic or 
like that sc important here to distinguish between moral constructivism and moral relativism they are closely related but different 
antirealist versions of morality but a relativist would say you have some sort of community you have a society 
that society comes up with moral standards and then what is right and wrong is judged only relative to 
that society believes and sort of a quietist view of morality in the sense that if not a member 
that society then you get to have an opinion you get to judge if you think that something is 
repulsive but going on in that society over there and they think okay then you have the right to 
anything whereas a constructivist say that a constructivist simply admits the reality that human beings are the ones who 
moral rules but once constructed them constructivism lets you be judgy of other people not a quietist point of 
at all if i have my moral rules and come up with them for what i think are good 
i can apply them and i will and do apply them elsewhere sc and i can use that as 
justification for acting in the world for making things better even if other people disagree with me now what 
want to emphasize here is that this picture of morality given by constructivism can sound a little wishy washy 
sound like well not strong enough for me if still bought into this picture where i want absolute metaphysical 
for my moral impulse for my moral rules in some sense then the idea that just made up by 
might not sound robust enough however i would like to point out that it is nothing more or less 
what actually happens in the world we actually do come up with our moral theories in this particular way 
think that this slightly not perfectly articulated fantasy that more realists have that says that i could just find 
objective moral rules then when i came into disagreement with somebody else in the world we could sit down 
coffee and i could convince them that they were wrong because objectively right and therefore objectively sc so i 
that actually ever what does happen you typically would not succeed sometimes maybe you would good for you but 
can certainly imagine situations in which you would not succeed in using the pure force of reason to convince 
that they should obey your objectively true moral guidelines whereas moral constructivism says i come up with some moral 
that i think are the right ones someone else has come up with some moral rules that they think 
the right ones and we can talk about right and wrong which ones should be enshrined in rules and 
and laws and things like that and sometimes we might just disagree in a profound way and not be 
to overcome that guess what this is what really happens in the world moral constructivism is just about bringing 
way that we theorize about ethics into line with the reality of how we practice ethics in the world 
now having said all that i talk a little bit about these ideas in the big picture in my 
book and really focusing there on these metaethical questions and i argue against moral realism and in favor of 
but then you wanna go from that metaethical stance morals are things that we construct to an ethical stance 
so what are the morals that we should construct and in the book i more or less punted on 
it the point i want to say here are the rules we should i made some vague gestures in 
direction but that was not what i was trying to do what i was trying to do was to 
up the idea that we can live in a way that is both moral and intellectually fulfilling in a 
universe so it still leaves us the job of coming up with the right moral rules so how do 
do that and a long complicated process obviously work being done here i think that two crucial components about 
we should go about constructing our moral rules or our ethical guidelines sc number one we reflect on what 
inner moral impulses are we human beings are not blank slates we are not devoid of moral judgment until 
read our first philosophy books we have feelings about what is right and what is wrong so reflecting on 
feelings means accepting and recognizing the fact that sometimes our moral intuitions if you like are not coherent are 
compatible with each other this is part of the job of moral philosophy to take our sort of inchoate 
moral intuitions and systematically turn them into something that is logically clear that says very definite things that do 
contradict each other this is the kind of thing that we try to do using ideas like a trolley 
thought experiment the famous trolley problem you have a trolley headed to kill somebody sorry a trolley headed to 
say five people and a switch that would move over the trolley onto a different track where only one 
would die sc if a deontologist who says want to take an action that would bring harm to then 
do not flip the switch a rule that not allowed to do it not your action that is literally 
someone whereas if a utilitarian that says we should have the smallest number of people then you would flip 
switch no problem and no right or wrong answer these are two different impulses that we simultaneously have and 
job of moral philosophy is to sort of reconcile them somehow and a moral constructivist would say might not 
a right or wrong reconciliation once and for all no objective standard but this is the task we have 
and the other thing we need to do is to communicate the first thing to do is reflect on 
inner impulses sc the second thing we need to do is to talk to other people ask them what 
impulses are ask them what their theory of morality is again no guarantee that if we do sit down 
coffee and communicate with each other and share our moral intuitions and try to reason together to come up 
a mutually agreeable moral system that we will succeed there could be fundamental irreconcilable differences that we never get 
so we figure out some political way of dealing with that we have value diversity and pluralism in a 
democratic society for example so we have to figure out a way to get around that but crucial along 
way to actually ask people what they care about what they think is right and wrong not simply to 
that we can logic our way into coming up with the objectively right answers sc and i think at 
end of the day a little skeptical and this is a very very tentative position on my part so 
me too much at face value or too seriously tentatively thinking that there a simple maxim that sums up 
right way that i believe we should be moral i believe that anything quite as easy as the categorical 
or the greatest good for the greatest number that will ever work i think that we human beings start 
as sort of a jangly bag full of moral intuitions values if you wanna call them impulses that we 
and some of these come from biology and evolution some of them come from our upbringing some of them 
from society some of them come from our cognitive careful philosophically logical reflection on what we should believe and 
we do believe and at the end of the day gonna have a bunch of rules of thumb for 
to deal with different situations and we might grow and get better and not even get better maybe a 
bit of a morally realist language sneaking into my rhetoric here sc but we evolve just put it that 
we can change over time and what we think should be that the balance between different values values like 
should be kind to each other you should care about other people you should make people happy you should 
insult them you should respect their personal space and their liberty and so forth a whole bunch of values 
we can all talk about and judge which should be different levels of importance in different particular situation now 
that unsatisfying is that not quite as pristine and clear as you would like especially if used to the 
of theories that we get in math or logic or physics sure it is unsatisfying if that were your 
but maybe that should never have been the standard maybe we should accept the idea that morality is something 
is always a little bit in flux that aiming toward it without their actually being an it that we 
ever achieve literally about the journey rather than the destination and we can talk to each other and we 
surprise ourselves sc we can say yeah i used to think that was the right thing to do but 
reflection after talking to people after growing in my personal experience and learning things now i realize that i 
that that was and a perfectly good way to live so with all those in mind think about how 
actually take that philosophy of right and wrong and apply it to some sticky situations that we actually run 
in the real world the first test case i wanted to talk about is the notion of vegetarianism is 
okay to eat animals the ethics of being a meateater i do think that this is a topic where 
meateater an omnivore if you wanna put it that way but i think that most omnivores are unreflective about 
omnivorousness i think that they grew up that way they figure fine this is life and how it is 
do wish that most people who ate meat gave more thought to the ethics of it to whether it 
right and wrong of course this is part of the motivation i had for moving naturalism forward that i 
that naturalists or people in general give nearly enough brain power forethought to the moral and ethical values that 
live by sc and so i respect vegetarians who become vegetarians for ethical reasons i think that makes sense 
me why you would do that even if i end up being in agreement with it at the end 
the day so what are the arguments for not eating meat for becoming a vegetarian i think two broad 
although again many little subarguments here not gonna go into all the details one broad class of arguments in 
of vegetarianism comes down to the environment to more or less practical issues centered on the practice of agriculture 
our actual world i think it is a true statement and a very real concern that modern agricultural practices 
very often harmful to the environment we cultivate huge herds of cattle and pigs and chickens and sheep and 
and goats and this stresses nature in ways that are very clear these various forms of livestock create methane 
is a greenhouse gas which leads to global warming and also the creation of farms often involves deforestation tearing 
or burning down trees and hurting the environment that way sc and i think that these worries are perfectly 
worries i completely agree with these arguments but i think that the conclusion of these arguments is we should 
the agricultural practices we should disincentivize harming the environment i think that these are arguments for becoming a vegetarian 
think that this is an example where believe it or not i agree with dick cheney our former vice 
in the philosophy of this dick cheney was once asked about conservation of energy not conservation of energy in 
physics sense but conserving energy in the sense of not running the heater or the air conditioner in your 
or driving too much and things like that and he said as far as he was concerned that was 
matter of personal virtue not a matter of public policy and i think right i think that whether or 
you let the house be a little bit cooler than is comfortable and wear a sweater to make up 
that that is a matter of personal virtue i think that the collective behavior of many many people doing 
well you know what not that many people doing it it really make that much of an impact on 
world sc where i disagree with dick cheney is that there i believe there should be public policies that 
create a penalty for hurting the environment so if you wanted to argue for legislation to charge agro businesses 
when they do things that harm the environment because in some sense poisoning the public commons in a very 
way that i could very much get behind but i think that you or me or any set of 
people choosing not to eat meat has a big impact on that so a way in which i would 
with someone like kant who says should act in the way that if everyone did it that would be 
right way to i think that if not everyone is doing it then it really matter if not otherwise 
bad the question is how do we affect important relevant effective social change not by individual virtue by legislation 
sharp strong demonstrations or something like that ways to manifest the public will various ways to get things done 
not eating hamburgers i think is really doing it sc so the other sets of arguments which i think 
more relevant for the current discussion are the more purely ethical ones about eating meat the idea that roughly 
roughly speaking because many variations on this theme but we assign we might imagine assigning an objective value to 
whether human life or animal life or whatever and we might draw the line as to where life is 
is not important some people would count plants what about insects what about viruses or something like that okay 
some group of living beings maybe just animals maybe conscious creatures in some sense that deserve to not have 
lives ended not saying true saying that is a potentially relevant interesting moral claim in that case killing whether 
beings or animals is simply wrong one way of putting this is why would you think okay to kill 
and pigs and then eat them but not kill cats and dogs and horses and other animals that we 
for pets sc so this is where the rubber hits the road in terms of thinking through our ethical 
that going to construct as good moral constructivist should we judge it to be wrong to kill animals in 
itself after all we judged it to be wrong to kill humans and you might have thought back in 
day before naturalism came along well there was a reason why killing human was bad because an objective value 
human life given by the special place that humanity has in the world either because of god or because 
something slightly vaguely more vaguely mystical in some way we have that anymore so maybe the question we should 
asking is not why is it okay to kill cows but why is it wrong to kill humans we 
that objective moral standard that we had when we were religious we have to do something different so as 
moral constructivist i would argue that it is wrong to kill human beings but not because some objectively absolutely 
reality of the moral world not because of some quasimystical attribution of an unbreakable right to live on the 
of human beings sc wrong because we humans generally think that killing each other is wrong we have that 
impulse we have that value we have that intuition that killing each other is a bad thing if nothing 
we human beings generally want ourselves to be killed so if i want myself to be killed and i 
completely neutral on killing other people the communication part of the way in which we come up with our 
rules would say i would go around asking other people they want to be and most people would say 
we would agree to come up with a rule that said not kill each other the kind of thing 
happens both in the real world and in the theory of moral constructivism of course sure that thinking out 
some people will disagree there are some people who think that it is okay to kill people john wick 
thinks okay to kill people in certain circumstances less fancifully there are plenty of people who think the death 
is okay plenty of people who think that there are just wars where you can go out and kill 
enemy sc so different ways of dealing with that you need to sort of think a little bit more 
about when it is okay and not okay to invent this rule about not killing people and when someone 
just a sociopath someone who just wants to kill people we lock them up we put them in prison 
least once they have killed somebody or they have done some violent act how mature societies deal with this 
invented a rule and those who stubbornly insist on violating it are punished in some way that is again 
what we do in the real world and i think what we should admit is what doing not a 
of some objectively real rule out there we construct the rule and then we enforce it so if the 
if the reason why we like killing people is because we want to kill or do we want to 
killed what do we start thinking about animals and i think that personally my feeling is that animals are 
now always tricky to directly draw the line between an animal and the human how are we different from 
other sc if you listened to my podcast with adam rutherford you know how subtle that distinction can get 
i think that there is never the less a distinction worth drawing obviously human beings have eaten animals throughout 
animals eat each other nature is red in tooth and claw not an argument that okay to kill animals 
that it should be okay or we should construct rules that says okay just a preemption of the idea 
not killing animals is somehow natural right the natural state is that everyone kills everyone else or they care 
not omnivorous most animals actually kill other animals but not because they mind it not because they invented a 
or moral structure against it not interested they get any benefit from it where animals do benefit from killing 
other animals generally what they do in human history so we are faced we need to come facetoface with 
issue that inventing the rules what rules should we invent sc a couple of things that mattered to me 
when it comes to how animals are different and it basically comes down to the communicative part of how 
invent how we construct our moral rules and a particular ability that human beings have to conceptualize the future 
certain ways parenthetically i should say of course any time we try to draw a line between humans and 
we might imagine humans that are injured or handicapped or disabled or have genetic defects or something like that 
individual human beings might not fit into this categorization that we have but i think perfectly sensible to say 
where choosing to draw the lines is around the human species compared to other species in the world so 
think just a footnote that not gonna get into in any detail what trying to do is ask what 
the distinction between animals nonhuman animals as a set and human animals and again another parenthesis here other people 
disagree and okay and we can talk about that cool we should do that sc i have friends who 
not eat animals or creatures with certain advanced nervous systems a famous rule that you eat things with a 
so drawing it between human beings and elsewhere and trying to explain why and again number one the communication 
and number two the future issues so let me explain what i mean by that sc the communication issue 
i mean is that we sit down with animals and discuss moral laws the part of the inventing our 
constructed sorry yeah our constructed morals is that we talk to each other and ask what each other want 
we do this in highly abstract ways you know some ways in which we can imagine talking communicating with 
absolutely true but also unmistakably a level of abstraction that we human beings can reach that the animals we 
draw up contracts right and actually realizing literally as saying this that the boundary between these two points trying 
make is a very fuzzy one the one point about how we communicate and the other about how animals 
the future sc the point being that you can certainly see that animals know about the future they worry 
certain circumstances things are going wrong the thinking of the example i have in mind is that when my 
ariel and caliban think that gonna take them to the vet they get upset they run away and hide 
we pull out the cat carriers in a way that is obviously antecedent to putting them in the cat 
and then getting in the car and going to the vet they know what that means they know that 
cat carriers indicate something bad is about to happen and i think that cats are not the single smartest 
set of animals out there so no question that animals can conceptualize the future in some way sc but 
to me is the idea of conceptualizing the future in a hypothetical way in a purely abstract way that 
us the ability to draw up mutually agreed upon rules and contracts you can train an animal no doubt 
what you do is say look if you do this for me tomorrow then next year i will do 
following thing for the kind of thing that as far as i know based on the science and the 
that aware of i could be wrong about this that other species other than human beings are not capable 
so the cats might run and hide when we pull out the cat carriers but when jennifer and i 
just talking about we need to take ariel and caliban to the vet next ariel and caliban do not 
to that they know that gonna be this bad thing they quite conceptualize that future event sc i think 
because i think that that idea of how we conceptualize the future is really secretly at the heart of 
i think that killing people is wrong and again gonna keep saying this over and over again all this 
tentative and maybe wrong so keep thinking about it together but the example that comes to mind again from 
quantum mechanics book is quantum suicide you may have heard of this thought experiment max tegmark popularized it although 
people talked about it if you believe in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics so you believe that 
a macroscopic system observes a microscopic system that the universe branches into multiple copies and different things going on 
measurement outcomes happening in each of those multiple copies then imagine the following experiment that you basically do a 
measurement with like a geiger counter or a spin or something like that and you hook up a machine 
if the measurement comes out one way you will be instantly killed instantly is very important because not suffering 
just cease to exist right away as much as technologically possible sc and then the other branch of the 
function where the other measurement outcome was obtained still there nothing happens to you okay the idea is that 
some sense and tegmark himself say this but other people have said this you mind being put through this 
experiment roughly speaking because now two branches of the wave function where there was only one in one branch 
you have nothing to worry about in that one and in the other branch you exist dead again presuming 
no life after death or anything like that so why should you mind nothing there to be minding no 
there to be upset that you got killed okay so putting aside issues that maybe you have friends and 
will be upset imagining an isolated loner kind of person sc so i think that this logic works as 
explain in the book something deeply hidden i say imagine a classical universe in which there was a machine 
could kill you instantly so forget about branches of the wave function just imagine that newton was right and 
was only one thing that ever happened in the world but there was a machine that could kill you 
you know that you were dying right you would be dead instantly you suffer and then after it happened 
longer there to be upset should you mind if such a machine kills you well my argument is i 
be upset at the prospect of such a machine killing me i wanna live on so the reason why 
would be bad is not because i would be upset after i was dead because upset now at the 
of it happening because right now imagining all sorts of possible futures for myself and that set of possibilities 
abruptly terminated by this crazy machine sc and i think that the same logic works for quantum mechanics and 
worlds i think that the prospect that in some branches of the wave function i exist can upset me 
as much as not existing at all in a single classical universe would be bad and if the reason 
we should be upset at killing because the people now who are alive like the prospect of dying apart 
from the fact that their friends might mind and so forth sc then i think that animals think the 
way as far as i know my reading of the literature i think that they have that sort of 
oriented hypothetical imagination that lets them think about a universe in which they exist and this is crude and 
to revision upon future scientific advances but to me as far as i can tell that is a crucial 
between human beings and animals and one that makes me not attribute this right to continue existing to animals 
the same way that my morally constructed rules attribute it to human beings now clearly a lot of details 
a lot of more specific ways we could go into that maybe someday discover that animals do have this 
we just realize how we could talk to them and then i would update my beliefs i would change 
beliefs about what we can do sc and again it does affect questions like is it okay to murder 
other pets well i think that what matters there is the human attachment to them i think that forget 
cats and dogs versus cows and horses i think that if you live in a culture where cats and 
are not pets where they are livestock then i think that anything morally wrong about eating them go ahead 
think that the reason why in our culture in my culture in my house eating cats and dogs is 
because i have cats and attached to them and an emotional feeling that i as a human being have 
that matters to me that is considered in my moral calculations now this is different than suffering of course 
i did this thought experiment with an imaginary machine that ends your life instantly an imaginary machine not the 
world in the real world killing often does involve suffering and i think that suffering is bad and no 
that in the real world of farming animals often suffer and i disagree with that i want them to 
sc i am in favor of the animals on farms living as happy a life as they can up 
the moment that they are killed i think that the killing again is sort of morallyneutral because the animals 
not anticipating dying at some point in the far future because they overheard it but the actual suffering in 
moment that animals undergo i think should be minimized as much as possible just as it should for humans 
the question is about how to actually make that social change and it should be about laws and regulations 
make happy i know what if a technical term for the kind of humane farming i suppose that respects 
existence on a moment to moment basis of the animals which i do think has some moral weight and 
another complication that i should mention cause morality is much harder and more complicated than physics is we human 
might value the idea of things living if not actual every specific thing you be too hung up on 
organisms living because we all die eventually sc you cannot put absolute value on organisms animals and so forth 
forever not plausible death is real and important and you must face up to it but maybe and i 
very reasonably you might care about the fact of life itself the existence of living beings maybe you even 
about variety and diversity within the space of living beings cause maybe you think that a diverse set of 
in a diverse ecosystem is an independent value i can totally get on board with that actually i think 
its perfectly sensible to be against allowing endangered species go extinct preserving a variety of habitats and animal species 
the world is something that i think is a perfectly reasonable value for we humans to get behind again 
before i think it leads us to vegetarianism i think that we can have both the value of having 
diverse ecosystem and eating meat at the same time sc having said all this let me say in case 
perfectly obvious again i totally respect people who go along with this kind of thinking i want i want 
to be mutual respect i want to lecture vegetarians i want vegetarians lecture me i want anyone to lecture 
else in a sort of hectoring way happy to talk about it in a rational way and maybe mind 
even be changed vegetarians and vegans especially have a reputation of being lecturers of pushing their values on other 
i know that there that vegans and vegetarians are like that but look there are meat eaters who are 
that too had plenty of examples of seeing meat eaters try to put their meat eating and shove it 
the face of vegans and vegetarians we tend to be defensive about our own personal values and that might 
something that actually happens but not something we should be proud of we should strive to do better sc 
brings us to the other example i promised to talk about the intellectual dark web and their engagement with 
correctness social justice warriors things like that i do recognize this is a subject some people are tired of 
people wanna hear about it becomes emotional and fraught and people take sides and get very passionate about it 
i put it at the end of this podcast welcome to skip it if you want to but personally 
think important that we talk about these issues even if it can get heated sometimes we have to be 
to have reasonable good faith dialogue about things we disagree about even if the underlying issues are by construction 
that are very very personal very very close to the heart of the people who are talking about them 
why would i bring up the intellectual dark web in a discussion that supposed to be about morality and 
sc well for one thing of course if talking about social justice justice is important part of ethics and 
for another i think this is a good test case for thinking about the relationship of morality and rationality 
and reason these are two things morality and reason that are not opposed to each other that we need 
work in concert in some way but different things and so how exactly they come together is an important 
when thinking about how to be moral what is the role of rationality when are we using it when 
we misusing it the intellectual dark web was coined as a term by eric weinstein eric is the managing 
at thiel capital i believe i might not get exactly his job title right i first heard his name 
few years ago when he was in the news at least he was in the guardian in the united 
the newspaper when there were headlines saying that there was a new theory of everything and eric weinstein might 
the next albert einstein revolutionizing physics many people objected to this since eric had not actually written any physics 
including about his new theory of everything and it seem quite sensible to dub someone the new einstein when 
even written a paper yet sc as far as i know the paper still been written maybe it has 
kept track but pretty sure it has not revolutionized physics i think i would have known about that i 
have been informed about that thing but just the term that eric coined many other people in the group 
peterson sam harris ben shapiro christina hoff sommers a sort of collection of people nothing official i think there 
membership cards or anything like that but this idea that a group of people intellectuals who are trying to 
the public through nontraditional means not just getting fancy professorships at ivy league universities publishing highprofile books getting reviewed 
the new york review and things like that sc i will confess that it always rubs me a little 
the wrong way when people foreground the idea that what saying is forbidden or contrarian or naughty rather than 
saying is correct or right good ideas not just forbidden ideas but okay a stylistic choice that i hold 
them what is the idea of the intellectual dark web other than this group of people like how would 
define what group of people it is besides their methodology for using podcasts and videos not just books so 
can look on reddit a reddit subreddit dedicated to the idw as you might call them the intellectual dark 
and there it says the term intellectual dark web refers to the growing community of those interested in space 
free dialogue held in good faith sc the community exists outside of any governing body and has no biases 
adhere to a collection of people willing to open rational dialogue spanning a variety of issues from politics to 
so i think this is a very problematic definition in a number of ways number one the statement that 
are no biases to adhere to sounds rather unrealistic to me but again not what gonna focus on right 
more importantly is that this is not a correct definition obviously not an accurate definition if you want to 
what is holding together this particular group of people and inaccurate in at least two ways first the idea 
this particular group of people is dedicated to open free dialogue is not at all borne out by the 
sc the most celebrated current member of the intellectual dark web would certainly be jordan peterson accrued a good 
of celebrity in the last couple of years and he infamously threatens to sue people who insult him by 
him a misogynist for example he has called for university departments that he disagrees with to be shut down 
one point he was planning a website that would keep track of college courses containing what he labeled so 
students could avoid them if they wanna be exposed to such ideas sc just a couple of weeks ago 
recording this peterson met with viktor orbán who is the president of hungary if not up on modern hungarian 
orbán is part of the populist wave that is sweeping the world at least a mini wave and he 
just say not a friend of free speech put it that way among other things cracked down on hungarian 
that he agree with in many ways so much so that the central european university which was located in 
has fled moving to vienna in austria because of the crack down by orbán peterson seemed to have a 
meeting with orbán in which they bonded over their mutual distaste for political correctness so these are not the 
of someone who is truly dedicated to the ideals of free speech sc members of the idw who are 
not uniformly proscience peterson and shapiro have expressed sympathy for climate skepticism they really think that the earth is 
and shapiro at least i dug up bio here but i know that ben shapiro has been sympathetic to 
design as opposed to ordinary darwinian evolution so not obviously a proscience group of people however okay just mentioning 
i think that important issues but what i wanna get at for this particular discussion is the reddit description 
what the idw is is only about methodology it does not mention the substantive beliefs that these people have 
it just says open to free discourse rational openminded good faith discussions but about what and what are the 
that advocating in these good faith discussions the members of the idw seemed to be very insistent that they 
not politically homogeneous that they have a diversity of viewpoints within their groups there are conservatives there are liberals 
have you they just want to advocate for free speech but the reality is that they actually do agree 
some substantive issues i think that a lot of people who really are dedicated to the traditional leftright dichotomy 
tried to shoe horn the idw into conservativism or even a gateway to the altright i think kind of 
waste of time sc not that interested in who is a gateway to what if you disagree with somebody 
disagree with what they actually say disagree with them because they might lead someone to follow someone even more 
if someone says true things and then for whatever reason that leads to more extremism down the road the 
saying are still true so the extent which i care about what the idw says is what they are 
saying not where they might lead sc and i agree that not really easy to put them on a 
liberal spectrum fully because there is a diversity of opinions but again they agree about some things the things 
disagree about are things like abortion rights or healthcare or climate change so there they are literally on the 
the spectrum of political ideas what they agree well look at the new york times this famous article by 
weiss that introduced the idw to the world where she mentioned certain things they agree about including there are 
biological differences between men and women and identity politics is a toxic ideology that is tearing american society apart 
and probably even though he say it quite there in that paragraph they would include the idea that there 
be racial differences in iq that separates say blacks from whites or asians these are the kinds of ideas 
the idw wants out there in the public sphere being talked about so not including that the fact that 
want to mention that in certain definitions of who they are is another sort of red flag in my 
i think that you should be candid about the beliefs that you have and want to spread certain ideas 
will not find being promulgated in idw discussions you will not find good faith dialogue saying maybe we should 
become intersectional feminists or maybe we should support sharia law courts here in the united sc what they agree 
there are cultural debates here in the united states include canada because jordan peterson is canadian it might very 
include other places in the world but i personally am just not familiar enough with what the cultural divides 
in those places to opine about that here in the us we have certain cultural disagreements there is the 
on the part of the idw that one side of those ongoing cultural debates is being repressive is being 
to the discussion of ideas is shutting down debate and the side that accusing of doing that is the 
social justice side sc so while they may disagree on abortion or healthcare they agree that there is a 
to free speech and open dialogue coming from the left that is why it is sort of natural for 
people to dub them conservative even if though they themselves like that so fine intellectually fine to disagree with 
on certain things they might be right a little worrisome they wanna be candid about that substantive set of 
but certainly okay to have substantive opinions but think about what these substantive opinions are actually about what actually 
for one thing not that naughty the idea there are fundamental biological differences between men and women you would 
to work really really hard to find people who disagreed with that statement sc there are implications of that 
that people might disagree with but not putting those implications front and center not admitting to those they wanna 
this incredibly banal statement about there are biological differences between men and women which is not really very controversial 
most quarters but if you think about what these statements are the existence of these differences and then the 
that they tease out from them between men and women different races people who might qualify as transgendered or 
gay queer those kinds of people you think about what all these opinions are saying these are not cutting 
scientific discoveries the idea that there are differences between men and women these are archie bunker opinions sc these 
opinions that your racist uncle at thanksgiving would have no trouble endorsing these are just sort of standard issue 
opinions about the natural differences between different groups of people that mean wrong that mean incorrect just because these 
have been around for thousands of years they could still be right even though been around for thousands of 
that often happens but the fact that they might be cast as controversial in this context despite the fact 
many people do hold them suggest we should think about them carefully suggest that we should say not only 
is the evidence for or against this but why is it that certain people hold these opinions why is 
that other people have become suspicious of these opinions what is the history of this sc and because when 
to think about being rational getting into the relationship between rationality and morality we have to admit that we 
opinions we have histories we have preexisting ideas in our head i like to think about being rational and 
choices about what propositions to believe in as a bayesian which is a fancy way of saying you say 
for all the propositions about the world you could imagine you assign some probability that they are true and 
you do that before you go out there and look at the world you call these your prior probabilities 
and of course you never do that before you go out there and look in the world you assigned 
priors at all all of us look at the world before we ever hear about bayesian reasoning so really 
thinking about is before you make extra observations of the world you try to explicitly state what your beliefs 
the world are you have background information about your experience in life about how you grew up about what 
and in that listing of your priors you better keep track of the fact that you have biases all 
of biases if neuroscience and psychology have taught us anything we are not perfect reasoning machines we can strive 
be rational we can aspire to get there to have our cognitive capacities have a stronger influence over how 
live our lives and make choices and assign credences to propositions but in the real world all sorts of 
in which we fall short at being perfectly rational sc not only do we have biases that affect our 
but also in what we pay attention to in the world what we care about what we value and 
that we should strive to get rid of our biases entirely we move toward that but never get there 
we will never not have biases just not psychologically or neuroscientifically possible if you read daniel book thinking fast 
slow a good framework for thinking about these things system two is our rational cognitive capacities system one in 
classification is all of our underlying heuristics and short cuts and intuitive ways of thinking about the world and 
one is the boss really like system two thinks in charge but analogized to the tiny little person riding 
elephant you know the tiny little person thinks in charge but the elephant is doing all the work here 
our heuristics our biases sc not gonna get rid of them what we can do is work to be 
of them to take them into consideration and i think the primary message i wanna get at here in 
particular discussion as i started to say maybe i finish saying it i care that much about the intellectual 
web as such i am using them as an example as a test case for thinking about these issues 
social justice political correctness and so forth none of this is new when i was in college in the 
were complaining about political correctness like sex right every new generation thinks it invented these ideas but been around 
a very very very long time sc and so i think that what we wanna get at here is 
we can best deploy rationality in a world where we recognize we are not perfectly rational we want to 
moral we wanna be good people we want to use the force of reason to help us decide what 
right and what is wrong we can never forget that the force of reason is imperfect in real actual 
beings so the intellectual dark web has put the word into their title i think good in favor of 
word intellectual not gonna begrudge them the ability to name themselves whatever they want important but that word matters 
me okay the word intellectual has power and it should be taken seriously intellectual mean intelligent it mean knowledgeable 
mean an academic or a professor or anything like that what it means to be an intellectual is that 
hold the truth as the highest value that you will work towards being correct forgetting about all of the 
influences all the other motivations all the other biases you might have sc whatever truth you find out you 
stick up for regardless of what other implications there are that in my mind is really what it means 
be an intellectual even if those truths are inconvenient uncomfortable and so forth the opposite of intellectual a stupid 
a dumb person an uneducated person the opposite of an intellectual is a flack an ass kisser a toadie 
who makes up arguments to support a preexisting position regardless of whether the evidence and rationality actually leads them 
a typical person who is not an intellectual might be an apologist for power for money for influence people 
are deploying their forces of persuasion for some purpose other than finding the truth telling people what they want 
hear is the opposite of being an intellectual and included in the list of people is of course yourself 
yourself what you want to hear is not what an intellectual should be doing sc and we recognize this 
example in science in science we know that this striving for getting at the truth is a constant battle 
our biases right why we invent blind analyses doubleblind studies and so forth if you heard my podcast with 
thorne you know about the example of ligo the gravitationalwave observatory where they were so afraid of giving in 
the temptation to find something even if it there that they instituted the system where they would inject fake 
into the data and not tell anybody there was like a tiny group of people a committee within the 
collaboration that was in charge of injecting fake signals into the data with the idea being that the rest 
the collaboration know whether that signal was fake or a real discovery out there in the sky and their 
would be to take it seriously to analyze it as if it were completely real and then only at 
end would it be revealed no we just faked sc and the idea is that you need to be 
guard against fooling yourself they wanted to make sure that they would be able to tell the difference between 
that really happened and something that they were just patting themselves on the back into thinking actually happened so 
wanna extend this practice of science the practice of knowing perfectly well that we human beings are not rational 
have biases and like to give into them and therefore should make extraordinary measures to safeguard against doing that 
i wanna extend it to morality and to rationality more generally i think it is an a very important 
of being a rational person sc so the intellectual dark web if you think about what is these substantive 
that they are supporting we live in a world where there are certain cultural fault lines okay where certain 
have been picked on historically certain other groups have been dominant certain groups have been oppressed certain groups have 
powerful and when it comes to these cultural fault lines the idw inevitably ends up supporting the group which 
in the us or north america has been historically dominant the powerful the ruling group they are acting as 
for the established order of things they want to say that the unequal representation for example or at least 
want to be try to be more fair they want to argue for the possibility that we should at 
consider that things like the unequal representation of blacks and whites men and women gays and straights and so 
in various positions of power and influence and wealth in the united states is not a result of bias 
discrimination just a reflection of the underlying natural order of things an unbiased playing out to talents and inclinations 
is the general impression that they want to either give or at least open to be open to the 
of sc so if you think about that claim if you think about the claim that the difference between 
number of men and women in science or in the united states senate or in positions of ceos or 
the forbes i know what is the forbes list four hundred people five hundred people billionaires the richest people 
the united states not equal men and women they reflect the actual percentage of men and women in the 
or blacks and whites etcetera so do you really want to claim that this is just how things should 
not actually a result of of bias and discrimination a very remarkable claim if you want to state it 
that boldly clearly had bias and discrimination in our society for a very long time and it gone away 
my mind pretty clear that still out there clear that we have made progress there are people whose ancestors 
too long ago were slaves here in the united states and there are still effects of that but much 
recent than that when i was born in okay so not that long ago within my lifetime women were 
allowed to apply to go to college at places like princeton yale georgetown the university of virginia okay a 
public school sc the idea that women should go to these places just countenanced blacks were openly discriminated against 
countless ways if familiar with the history of how blacks were discriminated against long after slavery was officially eliminated 
should read on the history of red lining the idea of drawing lines around certain areas of certain cities 
blacks were concentrated and refusing to give housing loans or mortgages to anyone who wanted to buy a house 
those areas this was an enormously influential policy not an official policy written down in laws at least not 
those places but an enormously influential practice i should say that prevented africanamerican families and communities from accumulating wealth 
owning their own houses and lands for a very long time it was officially declared illegal in one thousand 
hundred sixtyeight with the fair housing act but of course it kept on going unofficially for a long time 
study in the where it was much easier for poor white families in atlanta georgia to get a mortgage 
than for middle income or high income black families in atlanta sc and the results of this have been 
astonishing and two thousand nine is the most recent year i could find numbers for the wealth not the 
which is sort of the amount of money you make per year but the wealth so the total of 
assets minus your debts the wealth of a median white family in the united states is over one hundred 
dollars whereas the wealth of a median black family is under six thousand dollars an enormous wealth gap between 
and blacks in the united states so the idea that in situations where very recently there was official discrimination 
still today there are the lingering effects of discrimination and bias in our society the idea that somehow these 
play a huge role in deciding who gets what job who is promoted to what position who is paid 
to who we listen to that seems wildly unlikely to me we all know about how recently gay marriage 
finally accepted here in the united states it would be very very very strange indeed to think that the 
that led to these discriminatory policies suddenly evaporated when the policies themselves were finally overturned sc presumably there were 
why we had these policies people had beliefs that made these policies seem like the right thing to do 
even if you change the law the beliefs necessarily change even if they change with some people they change 
others so to me as a good bayesian thinking about what my biases are and what biases probably are 
more sensible to believe that our society is suffused with discriminatory ideas in ways both obvious and subtle so 
rational people it should be our job to accept that to face up to that reality and to keep 
much vigilance as we can to make sure that the effects of this discrimination and the underlying attitudes that 
to this discrimination distort the world we live in we want to live up to the ideals of the 
people who famously people who were the enlightenment thinkers who found the enlightenment themselves always live up to the 
of the enlightenment thomas jefferson owned slaves and raped one of his slaves our actual people in the past 
short of their own selfpromulgated ideals but we can try to do better we can try to be as 
to those ideals as we can sc the enlightenment teaches us that we are all created equal and we 
in a world where we are not all treated equal so a mismatch and we should fight against that 
example of such a mismatch that most familiar with and so i talk about it a lot is women 
science this has flared up as an issue over the last year or two a famous example where the 
alessandro strumia gave a talk at a conference that he got in hot water for giving so and it 
become as you might expect especially on the internet a hot button issue where people have convinced themselves strumia 
a martyr for the cause and so forth if so point was roughly speaking that women are underrepresented in 
because women on average have as much talent or interest in doing science as men do that was his 
now why was he even giving a talk about that at a conference on women in science he invited 
give the talk he invited himself he asked to give that talk and when asked what he was gonna 
about he lied he said he was gonna talk about some details of bibliographical statistics okay sc that was 
of his talk but that was not what his talk was about what he meant by that was he 
is ranking the value of individual physicist by how many citations they get by how often people would cite 
papers in in their own papers and basically almost absurd you if you wanted to sort of embarrass the 
who actually believe that women are not discriminated against you would come up with a hero like alessandro strumia 
turns out in the middle of the talk you begin to realize his real motivation for giving this talk 
that he applied for a job and he get it and a woman got it and he became convinced 
the forces of political correctness were flooding the market with unqualified women at the expense of much more qualified 
sc and there are people who believe this there are people who believe it at different levels of explicitness 
i just wanna bring up the absurdity of this idea not a lot of women in physics roughly speaking 
number of people who get phds who are women is that seems to be the number that been for 
few years now i was a host for a physics colloquium at caltech recently and i looked at the 
for the talk there were about eighty people in the audience and three of them were women and on 
floor of the building in caltech where the theoretical physics group is held theoretical high energy physics group i 
say roughly eight or ten faculty ten or twelve postdocs twenty or thirty graduate students and for several years 
a row there were zero women zero women among faculty postdocs graduate students all in total in the theoretical 
energy group at caltech so whatever the reason for this is and caltech is not completely representative and there 
fluctuations the numbers are small but the idea that the forces of political correctness are flooding theoretical physics with 
women is absurd on the face of it the women just there just not working a terrible way to 
the field if what trying to do sc if you think about it the idea that really men who 
a bad deal in physics not women is exactly like global warming denialism like climate denialism so what do 
mean by that so in both cases in climate denialism and in men are the real victims here denialism 
science a phenomenon that is perfectly obvious in climate the perfectly obvious phenomenon is the average temperature of the 
is increasing the earth is getting warmer in science it is that most scientists are men not women nowhere 
to and also then a pretty straightforward explanation for that phenomenon in the case of the climate that we 
dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere carbon dioxide is shooting up and if you look at the curves it 
just like the curve of temperature shooting up for women in science women have been discriminated against they allowed 
go to college chuckle for many years and those biases and those discriminatory assumptions that lay in the background 
evaporated sc but in addition to the phenomenon and the obvious explanation there are two other factors at work 
one there are complications in the explanation that there is a simple explanation in both cases but also complicating 
life is hard sometimes things are rarely very simple for the atmosphere sure putting carbon dioxide into it but 
things going on ice sheets and permafrost and the ocean versus the land and all sorts sun spots who 
for women in science there are forces that are trying to increase the representation of women in science own 
in being a scientist or not being a scientist having children a million other complicating factors okay and number 
there is a political motivation sc there is a reason to resist the obvious explanation in the case of 
there is both this entrepreneurial capitalistic motivation to say i wanna keep burning fossil fuels this makes me and 
is complicated for other reasons if you remember my podcast with naomi oreskes she explained how libertarian politics and 
fight against the soviet union in the really led to some people to resist the scientific consensus on global 
and a political motivation for women in science also there are men like alessandro strumia who want to admit 
maybe women are discriminated against they think of themselves as perfectly unbiased perfectly fair in these things so the 
if you look into it if you dig into the science carefully for global warming or for women in 
the complications of the underlying explanation change the underlying explanations when you do it a little bit beyond the 
naive it turns out that sure a simple explanation for global warming but also more complicated things you can 
and the explanation still works sc the world is still getting warmer still a bad thing we should still 
putting greenhouse gases into the environment for women in science yes many complicated factors they wanna have kids family 
maybe at very young ages they become less interested in science but the discrimination is still there and it 
keeping women out of science in very very large numbers but if ideologically motivated to deny the reality you 
leverage those complications you can throw up a cloud of disinformation you can talk about all sorts of other 
going on and this is a wellknown technique in propaganda if you have an audience that is sympathetic to 
certain point of view even if that point of view is not true you can give them a reason 
accepting that point of view just by muddying the waters just by saying all sorts of different things and 
them sort of a license to say we really this is the kind of thing that jordan peterson would 
about climate change sc we really know a lot of complicated things we jump to and you see this 
of thing at work in talk you can see the slides for his talk online one that is especially 
where he is comparing the career number of citations from women physicists and men physicists and so he plots 
number of citations you have per year five years after your phd ten years after your phd fifteen years 
and you can see very clearly that men just keep going up and up and up and the women 
of go up at a much lower rate they seem to be accumulating fewer citations over time sc now 
chuckle very good argument to be made that total number of citations is not an unmediated measure of scientific 
it begs the question of whether or not the women are being discriminated against by getting less citations but 
that aside the hilarious thing is that he completely ignored the fact that women leave science he was comparing 
who stayed in physics for fifty years to women who had done physics for five or ten years and 
left the field it is completely unsurprising that their total number of those citations over time are very different 
spend a lot of very different time writing papers sc not to say that the underlying conclusion is not 
but the analysis is woefully hilariously inadequate and it comes about because he knew what answer he wanted to 
and he got it and then he stopped thinking about it the kind of thing that can happen when 
an intellectual when not devoted to the truth when you have an answer you want to get you sort 
get there and then you stop thinking anymore the reality is that discrimination is real against women against blacks 
a million different ways discrimination in physics as well as elsewhere in the world what you can test for 
every test reveals the same basic answer that biases are real they exist this is why concert musicians have 
a system where if you wanna audition for the orchestra you do so behind a curtain so the people 
are listening to you are listening to your music not looking to see whether you are male or female 
the test show that there was a huge bias in favor of male musicians sc there are obviously examples 
harassment within physics and harassment is sort of an extreme example of something that happens all over the place 
professors commenting on appearance students and as well as other faculty colleagues i personally see this all the time 
cannot possibly imagine how someone could be in the physics community have their eyes even slightly open and not 
all of the million ways in which worth is questioned as a scientist it is just a constant stream 
very very subtle questioning like you really belong kinds of things and you can say if you wanna be 
scientist you should suck it up you should put up with all those little people questioning your but unbalanced 
people need to suck it up fine but no reason why women need to suck it up more than 
exactly the example of discrimination death by one thousand cuts not necessarily actively being pushed out sc and not 
a simple relationship between math ability and whether you become a physics professor there are more women in mathematics 
there are in theoretical physics girls get better grades in math classes than boys do okay girls do as 
on standardized tests of mathematics as boys do past a certain age very early age similar later on it 
different so the question is is doing math in the real world more like getting a grade in a 
or more like taking a multiple choice test i think you could make a case that more like getting 
grade in a class all of this influence all of this questioning that women really belong in this field 
starts very very young my niece once we went to christmas we gave my niece and my nephew both 
presents my niece who was like i know eight years old ten years old at the time she opens 
christmas presents and it was a little erector set to build an electric car just a tiny little thing 
built an electric car little battery in it and you made it go and she opens and she looks 
it very young and she looks at us and says i think there was a mistake this is for 
sc and we said no really not for your brother for and you could see her struggling with this 
get presents like right and not because actively discriminated against not because my brother and his family were trying 
steer her away from science or engineering or anything like that just there are supposition about what girls want 
what boys want and the hilarious upshot of this story is that half an hour later she had built 
car and it was zooming around the floor and she was loving it she had never been able to 
with something like this before we just sort of start when children are born assuming that they like certain 
like other things and for some girls it work some girls would be completely not interested in cars and 
okay but if we give them the chance never know so what doing here in this discussion i know 
i went on extra long about that because it is very close to my heart and focusing on the 
of the discrimination the existence of these thousand mild ways ways both mild and strong that women are nudged 
of science and the effect that it has on them sc and not having a discussion about what the 
abilities are given to us by biology whether we are men or women that is the subject that the 
who believe in discrimination tend to prefer to focus on and the reason why not focusing on it is 
cares i really so this idea that if i want there to be discrimination i must be denying the 
of biological differences not it that i care about biological differences it is certainly true to anyone who has 
met both men and women that the women who are good at math and physics are better at it 
the average man at math and physics right therefore knowing that someone is male or female should have absolutely 
influence on how you judge them as a mathematician or physicist or other forms of scientist you should judge 
they actually are as an individual it may be the case that there is a difference between girls and 
intrinsically in different kinds of ability sc it may be that not any actual intrinsic difference very very hard 
know that because of course the moment born you start being treated differently depending on whether you are a 
or a girl but it matter because discrimination is bad regardless if there is a difference between men and 
in intrinsic ability and women are also discriminated against just for being women we should work to get rid 
that discrimination if there is not a difference between men and women at intrinsic ability and there is discrimination 
should also work to get rid of that discrimination that is what matters the people who concentrate on the 
existence of intrinsic differences in ability between men and women based on standardized tests sc these are generally not 
who have a professional interest in genetics or psychology or anything like that sometimes they are but a lot 
people who are not in that camp who nevertheless seem fascinated by this particular topic the only reason they 
is because they are being apologist for the current system they are being apologists for the idea that there 
no evidence for discrimination because they wanna say i can map the existence of intrinsic ability onto the number 
nobel prize winners and the number of faculty members etcetera but an irrelevant argument if a separate way of 
and asking is their discrimination out there in the world anyone who is working in the sciences or who 
science knows that there is discrimination out there and bad and what matters sc and of course there are 
things to be said about race about sexual identity and so forth a number of ways in which discrimination 
still real we want to be better people but not people yet not perfect people we probably never will 
perfect people we need to keep working on it and you know look discrimination and things like that they 
come out of evil or bad impulses known the sweetest people who would be horrified at the idea that 
were in any way sexist or racist who never the less exhibited ideas predilections that would be obviously by 
outside observer labeled as sexist or racist and those secret attitudes those parts of you that you always bring 
to the surface and question can absolutely affect how you go through your life but i think evil or 
necessarily a moral miscalibration sc and this finally gets us back to this issue of the interplay between ethics 
morals and rationality and reason if you want to follow the advice of the intellectual dark web you should 
rational you should be reasonable ben shapiro likes to say care about your and this is very very true 
we all have feelings whether you like it or not we should admit that we have feelings sometimes you 
dig deep to get to the ultimate facts confronting feelings that you might not want to admit are there 
you there is this temptation as i said to come to the conclusion you like and then stop rationality 
often used for purposes of rationalization of rationality should be you start with the data and you work to 
conclusion rationalization is you start with the conclusion you like and then you go backwards and construct a seemingly 
justification for it sc we are all subject to this not trying to pick on people who i disagree 
politically subjected to this i have racist and sexist parts of my upbringing that are still there how in 
world could i not we live in a racist and sexist society overwhelming evidence for that i can try 
be better i want to be racist or sexist but if i were to just simply say if i 
stephen colbert in his character of the colbert report and saying see race i think that a young asian 
joke because it be true we should admit that we are human beings bundles of impulses and heuristics and 
one chattering away beneath the surface and be open to the possibility that that affects our behavior sc rationality 
instrumental it finds conclusions from whatever inputs it gets but we can ask ourselves even if we are perfectly 
where do the inputs come from what facts about the world do we choose to look at so if 
am concerned that maybe women are getting unfair advantages very easy for me to see certain fellowships or opportunities 
women in particular that men have i can see that hiring committees faculty hiring committees go out of their 
to find female candidates and that is bright and vivid to me and makes me mad and makes me 
injustice in the world and i can just not notice all of the ways in which women are nudged 
from science throughout their entire lives from when born through elementary school through high school through undergraduate through graduate 
and beyond and so to me being rational when i say like this is very unfair that this fellowship 
only women can get or this job that this woman and because of the garbage in garbage out principle 
have i take into account all of the facts of the real world but the facts i chose to 
into account i reasoned with in some way sc so you can see a conservative speaker invited to a 
who is being heckled or even being deplatformed not allowed to give a talk at that college and you 
see the reality of racism or sexism or homophobia or transphobia that affects the lives of students in these 
so in my opinion people stifling speech in the name of fighting racism is bad i am not in 
of that very much in favor of a wide variety of speech about all sorts of things even the 
people should be able to talk if a group on campus that wants to invite a speaker i think 
they should always be allowed to invite that speaker no matter how bad the person is and some people 
with me about this some people think that certain people are beyond the pale they should not be allowed 
be invited not just campuswide but even by any group on campus so i disagree with them and happy 
had that conversation with them sc in my mind this problem of racist speakers being invited to campus or 
being invited to campus is not anywhere near as bad as the problem of racism almost absurd to try 
balance the effect of racism on the lives of black people in the united states versus the problem of 
particular speaker get to give a talk because they were considered to be racist both problems but not problems 
equal magnitude in my mind and i know that what some people will say to that kind of argument 
can many bad things going on out there in the world i get the right to choose which bad 
gonna focus on right i solve all the problems of the world some problems are more important to me 
i think a true statement but a limit to how far that reasoning goes when the problems talking about 
closely related sc the idea i have in mind is if you go to a restaurant and you order 
and supposed to be hot and you get it cold so this is a traditional setup for complaining to 
waiter you say my soup is cold supposed to be now if the waiter were to say to you 
you worry about something so trivial as cold soup when global climate change is destroying our be an absurd 
on the part of your waiter right i mean true climate change is a much bigger problem than the 
of your soup but a problem from a completely different area the waiter has no right to say like 
spend exactly as much time complaining about problems in proportional to how bad they not a good way to 
through life but if the waiter said dare you worry about something so trivial as the temperature of your 
when the kitchen is obviously on fire and evacuating the in that case the waiter is correct and because 
particular issue the kitchen being on fire is closely related to the situation going on in the restaurant right 
sc so sure you can say i care about free speech not about but when free speech and racism 
it makes sense to balance the relative importance of these different problems i think that fighting racism is a 
bigger problem than getting speakers on campus even if they are both problems for many people in our culture 
much as we want to admit it the metaphorical kitchen is on fire the restaurant is burning down they 
a life where just a huge number of ways in which they are not treated equally not because of 
they are as a person but because of what group they belong to that mean that such people are 
about everything or that their view of the world is intrinsically correct but it offers a perspective that other 
might not have when you do not have to put up with certain forms of discrimination hard to put 
into the mindset into the world into the life of someone who does sc i had this discussion with 
bloom on the podcast and paul wrote an interesting provocative book about being against empathy and his argument was 
to empathize with people like ourselves and by doing that empathy gets in the way of being again this 
and rationality intersection and he argued that we were simply rational then we could be moral we could be 
people without trying to put ourselves in the situations that other people are facing without being i think a 
mistake in that analysis because clearly if you do restrict your empathy to people like yourself then yes then 
agree with them then you can in fact be irrational about your moral conclusions because not taking into consideration 
perspectives of other people but my solution to it is we need more empathy not less we need to 
our empathy to really let us understand where other people are coming from especially when people have very very 
life situations than we do sc not a believer that someone with a different life situation than me has 
insight that i must sort of instantly accept when they offer it but i do as an enlightenment thinker 
someone who believes that all knowledge is provisional and fallible and subject to updating i realize that they know 
i and i should be able to listen to them and learn something the important thing not accepting what 
people say about racism just because black accepting that they know something about racism that i because black because 
a different experience i should try to listen to what they have to say when i do my best 
accept what they have to say then i should reason by myself then i should do the best i 
to reach a correct conclusion but i have to be open to those experiences to those voices to those 
ways of living in the world sc and i even think there should be empathy for privileged straight white 
in favor of that the word privilege has become very charged obviously we talk about male privilege about white 
and so forth and it rubs some people the wrong way and i get it why it rubs people 
wrong way i also get why used and i think a useful concept but if you are a straight 
man and accused of having white privilege for example you can instantly start thinking to yourself not privileged my 
was tough i earned what i maybe you are poor maybe you were just like not that socially adept 
you were young maybe you faced a great tragedy your parents died or something like that a million ways 
which your individual life may be a struggle even though you were labeled as having white privilege or male 
or something like that sc but privilege mean that you had an easy life not what the word means 
this particular context what it means is that there are obstacles that you face simply because of your membership 
certain groups it mean you face other obstacles but guess what people who are black or gay or transgender 
whatever they can also face the obstacles of being poor being socially awkward having family tragedies and what have 
and they also can face things like racism and misogyny and transphobia which you have to if you were 
straight white person the example that comes to mind since i always conceptualize difficult problems in terms of basketball 
recently the toronto raptors won the nba championship in a game in oakland over the golden state warriors and 
ujiri who is the general manager of the toronto raptors so the guy who chooses which players to trade 
and to draft and to sign so basically the boss of the basketball team sc and when they won 
game to finally win the championship game six he rushed out of the court to join the celebration and 
was held back by a police officer and the police officer originally claimed that ujiri actually had punched him 
then guess what of course the nba championship and they just won and a million cameras and videos around 
punching involved as it was shown so the police officer then said he have his guess what he was 
his credential in his hand so ujiri was wearing a suit he was carrying his credential in his hand 
was the general manager of the basketball team that had just won the nba title and when he tried 
join the celebration he was stopped by a police officer sc now maybe this would have happened were he 
but he white and it happened and i think that by any objective way of measuring the probabilities here 
chances that would have happened had he been a white businessman looking general manager are much lower an example 
privilege that a different way of looking at people and individual cases are always a little problematic to lean 
because you never know maybe in this particular example the officer had instructions that would have led him to 
the same thing for anyone of any race or ethnicity i know that for sure what you know is 
an accumulated effect of many many many examples of things like that of how people are treated differently because 
their skin color in the united states so a real kind of privilege that white people have it mean 
life was easy it means you had a different life experience sc okay so where are we bring this 
to this original question of how to be a good person how to act morally in the world and 
me use an example from sam harris it sounds like picking on sam harris i mean to do that 
talk about sam a lot because worth engaging with i think that more interesting he has more interesting things 
say to me than some of his intellectual dark web compatriots his podcast for example was certainly a role 
for mine inspiration for thinking that you could have long conversations about intellectual topics and people would be interested 
listening to it not a lot of evidence for that in the world and he certainly provided some so 
i engage with him because i think worth trying to engage in constructive disagreement sc so there was a 
on his podcast i think it was with jordan peterson probably was given the subject the subject was pronouns 
used by transgender people a lot of transgender people want to be referred to by very specific pronouns that 
care about sometimes they would wanna choose pronouns from the existing english language he she so forth other times 
prefer madeup words because in a different situation than cisgender people would find themselves and this is an ongoing 
about how we should deal with this so sam put forward his opinion that he thought that people requesting 
him that he use certain pronouns to refer to them he was not in favor of that because he 
a positive imposition on asking him to do something not just asking him to not do something bad but 
him to do something actively good it takes energy and if we just extrapolate an infinite number of things 
i could be asked to do and not something he thinks is quite fair sc so my attitude towards 
is yeah yeah it is asking you to do something positively it would take energy making the world a 
place might very well require effort require an exertion of energy even on the part of people who have 
themselves made the world the worst place i think that just a very plausible thing the argument that there 
be an infinite number of things you were asked to do is just kind of silly not an infinite 
of things asked to do asked to do the things that makes the world a better place that makes 
more fair that lets people be treated how they want to be treated people who are not transgender typically 
no trouble at all getting referred to by the pronouns they prefer this automatically happens for them people who 
transgender have to work at it and that is an imbalance between the life experiences of those different people 
in my mind and again maybe this comes down to empathy transgender people have to put up with a 
they are born and grow up into this realization that they conform to what the world expects of them 
what the society around them wants them and believes them to be and constantly reminded of that that is 
tough way to grow up or even if you find out about it later in life a tough way 
exist it can result in bullying ostracism you could be ostracized from your family or friends you can become 
sometimes it leads to suicide not an easy way and lot of courage associated with being able to openly 
that way sc so if i learned that i can make someone like life easier simply by referring to 
using the words that they prefer to be referred by that sounds to me like the very least i 
do not that many ways in which i can clearly and obviously make the world a happier better place 
is one of them so i find it very easy to do that i mean not easy to necessarily 
what preferred pronouns are a sticky social situation that still working at but if someone tells me what they 
i will do everything i can to try to use them and that can be tricky too because again 
one is in charge here how we refer to people is often unconscious and we have to sort of 
override and it can be work i get that to me i think work very well worth doing i 
that a huge part of being moral being a good person in the version of morality that i construct 
a constructivist is breaking out of our biases our perspectives sc we should always start by thinking probably a 
bit the safest way to go through life because then open through to how that manifests and if you 
actually not really manifesting behaving in a very nonbiased good for you to me this is the enlightenment at 
this is treating people with equal dignity cosmopolitanism openness to new experience being able to admit that our beliefs 
perspectives might not be complete might not be right we can always do better be aware of what our 
are even the possibility of biases that we yet recognized do everything we can to get rid of them 
and i know what some people are thinking here there also a bias the other way or there at 
be a bias there be a bias towards sort of the righteousness of feeling that you are oppressed and 
gives you some extra handle on virtue or something like yeah absolutely i agree with the possibility of that 
i think that we can all be bias again a human thing it belong to one group or another 
rational not perfectly rational perfectly virtuous perfectly moral we can all work to be better at it but again 
think that a sort of comparison to be done if there are groups that are historically oppressed picked on 
treated equally gonna be a little bit more sympathetic to them fighting against this than the people who are 
the dominant group sc very sympathetic to worries about free speech as i said i think that we could 
a much better job those of us who believe that free speech is important i think we could do 
much better job in acknowledging and understanding and talking about the reasons why certain people want to be subjected 
certain kinds of speech if you simply understand that motivation then not being rational not being intellectual not facing 
to reality i try my best to understand why certain people want certain speech acts to happen and to 
why that work within it my current understanding just like the vegetarianism is that nevertheless despite the very real 
that speech can do worth it it can be put in certain regions like you be forced to hear 
kinds of speech there should be safe spaces where you can avoid certain kinds of speech but there should 
other spaces where that speech is available if what you want to go to sc i do believe that 
are people who go overboard in fighting for racial justice or sexual justice or whatever and they become so 
that they wanna shut down people who disagree with them and i come to that conclusion i disagree with 
people that make them my enemy if i reach a point personally where people who go overboard because fighting 
racism and sexism and discrimination i start thinking of them as my enemies rather than allies i disagree with 
gonna have to rethink my own life choices here gonna have to take a step back and think about 
i am i can be on the same side against racism as someone whose tactics and strategies i disagree 
i have no trouble believing that at all sc i did on twitter at one point tried to promote 
idea of millian social justice after john stuart mill of course the famous philosopher who gave the most eloquent 
of free speech and the free market of ideas and he also gave a very very eloquent defense of 
rights of women now it may be that his wife harriet i actually i know if they got married 
think they get married later in life but harriet taylor probably was responsible for a lot of the ideas 
even some of the writing in the subjugation of women and some other of books but i like the 
that things like freedom of speech the free market of ideas the give and take of dialogue and discussion 
openness the realization that all fallible and imperfect and biased and working to get better sc all of that 
together is a powerful force could be a powerful force for social justice not just against it that if 
do it right if we talk to each other in the right way if we are open to listening 
other people if we are opening to admitting that not perfect that we come with a bundle of ideas 
the surface that we might not even be aware of and we can always do work to improve them 
one of the ways to improve them is to listen to other people listen to people who we disagree 
even if we end up still disagreeing with them even if we learn nothing doing a little bit of 
i think that doing that in good faith is actually a great force for making the world better including 
against racism sexism other forms of bias and discrimination sc hoping that in some broad but minor sense the 
pushes us in that direction i wanna actually spend a lot of time on mindscape talking to outandout racists 
i do wanna talk to people i disagree with especially about strategies for making the world a better place 
of this as i said very much at the beginning of this overly long solo podcast all of this 
very tentative in my mind these areas of being a good person being moral having good ethics these things 
anyone should be all that certain about in their own minds we can all learn and do better trying 
to do better hopefully all trying to do better see how well we do thanks for listening byebye music 
you dr carroll in your discussion of the idw i had hoped that you would have mentioned the suppression 
thought that occurred with nick christakis former guest and his wife erika bret weinstein and his wife heather heyling 
well as what happened to jonathon haight at nyu political correctness is something to be mindful of i refer 
to tom one thousand nine hundred seventy book chic and mau mauing the flak as one who follows hume 
boldly assert knowledge and open discussion is good i am guessing caltech does not face some of the thought 
efforts evident at yale evergreen or nyu nothing i say should cause anyone to conclude i do not believe 
social injustice climate change and inequality exists and needs to be considered this is going to be a provegetarian 
but i want to start with a few caveats my arguments assume one lives in a firstworld country where 
is economically feasible to subsist on plant products alone i will limit the scope to vertebrates since there is 
a wide spectrum of living being with vastly different abilities to experience suffering i am going to argue for 
than vegetarianism as your stated desire of on farms living as happily as they can up until the moment 
are is consistent with an omnivorous society but i will hope to point out why they are not consistent 
the reality of our omnivorous society i am not trying to make anyone feel bad but will probably inevitably 
so hopefully this come across as i am simply trying to state my case by stating facts many of 
are unpleasant and make people myself included feel bad now for my comments i am glad that you recognize 
the reality of animal agriculture on farms living as happily as they can up until the moment they are 
concept simply does not exist outside of certain extremely small niche farms the cows you see grazing in pastures 
you drive by on country roads does not represent reality the reality is that the vast majority of animals 
raised in concentrated animal feeding operations cafos to transition to a system where we have on farms living as 
as they can up until the moment they are would be economically and environmentally unsustainable if the demand for 
products remains as high as it is below is a small sampling of things that i think would have 
happen for us to reach such a state i am not saying these things to be accusatory or to 
anyone feel bad saying them because it is imperative that one understands that this is the economy of scale 
the animal agriculture industry has achieved and the level of efficiency that they operate at the footprint of the 
used would have to drastically increase cages veal sheds etc would have to go the footprint would need to 
by probably at least an order of magnitude we would have to use less efficient breeds of animals as 
of them have been bred for maximum yield at the expense of the health of the animal for example 
broiler chickens grow incredibly fast and incredibly large to the detriment of their own health b commercial hens have 
bred to lay eggs a year in the wild they lay per year imagine the toll that menstruating times 
a year would have on a human woman c many people know that sheep will if they are not 
this is only true because we bred out the genes that caused them to shed naturally as it increases 
yield this has led to practices such as mulesing removing skin around the anus so that it scars over 
does not grow hair there as it would become easily infected inhumane practices such as dehorning debeaking mulesing see 
etc would need to be stopped again these practices are done for the sake of efficiency we would have 
throw efficiency out the window in order to achieve a reality where we have on farms living as happily 
they can up until the moment they are in this reality animal products would be an expensive luxury that 
could perhaps only a few times a week or if they hunted the animal themselves any higher demand would 
that we revert back to these practices in order to meet it in conclusion to those who agree with 
ideal of on farms living as happily as they can up until the moment they are i would hope 
you choose to live in accordance with that ideal by doing one of the following eating vegan or vegetarian 
reducing your animal consumption and making sure that you responsibly source the animal products that you do consume you 
probably find that the step is so difficult and cumbersome that it is easier to simply resort to suggestion 
is one last thought to ponder but which i get into in this comment but if you want to 
to it feel free some mentally retarded humans have cognitive and communicative abilities at or below the level of 
that we eat would killing and eating them be a act suppose they have no friends or family who 
for them if not then why not hi dr carroll i loved your great courses series as i love 
podcast but i am a little disappointed your choice of iconic i hate this appropriate moral conundrums vegetarianism and 
multiculturalism has gone fails to reckon with what i consider the most pregnant moral conundrum we as a most 
those of us endowed with a somehow politically resonant voice which is not a free that of socalled growth 
the strictures of capitalist neoliberal which is as a scientist i would appreciate your take on this clearly selfdestructive 
maybe for an escaping few or at least a period of sacrificial socialism that allows for a transition to 
rational society of technological and environmentally neutral proliferation of wealth why did you pick the subjects you did to 
detriment of my concern not that this is of course recent research knows that animals from rats to chimps 
elephants have emotions will that change your analysis about the way we use them eat experiment keep in captivity 
is a recent discussion on the subject in particular the first speaker de waals what happened to the scott 
interview that was mentioned also speaking of animals eating animals have sean b carroll on the podcast i enjoyed 
royal inst video on africa are we allowed to talk about men having an innately higher preference for things 
systematizing vs people and nurturing for women you talk about it so presumably you think better off not talked 
where i see the trouble is without this in the conversation we frame the problem as how to encourage 
girls and women so much as constantly blame men especially white men for the oppression also would you agree 
the left learned how to draw a line where they are going too far and need to have that 
right now witnessing a on whether it is okay to beat a journalist to the point of brain bleed 
having a wrong opinion in temperament very left but i absolutely deal with the extreme version which unfortunately is 
version that seems to have crept in where i work in tech and startups also in the awkward position 
the left that i think jordan peterson cured my depression and convinced me to sort out my own problems 
that a sustainable society by definition needs to care about reproduction and group responsibility for raising the next generation 
growing up on mr rogers and carl sagan previously i was a huge fan of new atheism stephen pinker 
yourself but their attempts to inspire meaning fell completely flat for me sure a unique creature in the cosmos 
multiverse with a chance to exist but that explain why i was lying in bed calculating how long it 
take to hit the ground if i threw myself off my floor balcony and why i was completely invisible 
women despite a successful career i needed to sort that out and jp gave me the psychological tools for 
ps huge fan of your science writing and lectures and a podcast of you engaging with eric weinstein would 
a dream really excellent i almost listen i wanted another which i thought was brilliant but you hooked me 
with references to big which is an important book for me and in fact i think this podcast has 
same things i value in big that spirit of inquiry of the listen to all you podcasts but hopin 
more like thsi i thought about this yesterday and slept on it i still think a good idea for 
sean couples therapy recently i viewed sam harris interviewing his wife annika about her new book and he was 
giggling and he did laugh this epiphenomenon deserves more attention there are so many similar incredible couples you and 
bret weinstein and heather eric weinstein and pia nick and erica christakis there needs to be a forum where 
such couples meet and exchange ideas i think the female participation reduces ego and conflict but that is only 
hope until proven it may be unwieldy though i would suggest david reich and his wife eugenie as a 
possibility regardless david would be very interesting by himself i am sure hi sean great podcast this one kept 
up most of the night thinking i reluctantly agree that there appears to be no objective morality i one 
in this era that i wait for a benevolent ai to take over global governance the reality is that 
attempt to program moral rules into that ai rapidly begins to look like global communism where the gdp of 
world would likely be redistributed to about seventeen thousand dollars usd per person it is hard to argue against 
morality of giving or more the population a increase in living standards unless you are in the other alternatively 
ai could place a utility value on all future lives that could possibly be lived then it could easily 
the morality of nuclear disarmament by any means necessary including a first strike if survivors could be predicted and 
time line was long enough its clear that hard moral rules require a level of cognitive dissonance to selectively 
and if the same ai was programmed to enforce ten then it would rapidly look like a dystopian future 
podcast forced me to think about the moral rules i have adopted from society without thinking about them it 
shocking to see how much discount our society places on the lives and well being of other people who 
not in our i think you are having tunnel vision about what reality is the distinction between naturalism versus 
is completely obvious for science no discussion here but your definition of reality is too generic on the one 
and too limited on the orther hand you overlooked the difference between living beings and dead matter sure everything 
the smallest level looks the same quantum but a living creature has feelings and that is the most relevant 
when discussing morality you basically missed biology completely and you end up with an akward nerdy vision on moral 
please read sapolsky and de waal and try again hi sean thanks for this podcast it was very thoughtful 
you did a good job of explaining your opinions on these subjects regarding vegetarianism i tend to agree with 
you have said here it may well be that we eventually discover that animals actually do a number of 
aspects you have attributed to human beings but it is still likely that we will never be able to 
our human systems to other animals i have attempted to be a vegan and vegetarian at a number of 
in my life this was due to a number of factors the largest of which was due to working 
the food industry as a factory auditor and product expert for fifteen years where i learn a lot of 
about food processing that i became uncomfortable with but ultimately i could not find a diet that suited me 
the long term always ending up feeling lethargic and developing anxiety issues so instead i now opt to more 
less limit my meat consumption to once every twentyone meals and this seems to do the job nicely i 
think you have been a little disingenuous about the idw whilst your description of them as individuals and the 
with the group and its name is definitely correct using the concept of a demiurge that lies at the 
of all human ideas as the reason they are incorrect is a poor show all theories and concepts contain 
demiurgical position the theories of physics have black holes big bangs holography mathematical infinities etc whilst i cannot speak 
the others in the idw group jordan peterson particularly is very open and honest about where his downfalls are 
where he is blindsided in his knowledge i am sure you are correct about discrimination in science and it 
vital that all people are equal throughout society but please can i add that outcome equality is not the 
individuals should have the opportunity to pursue whatever they enjoy and their skills should be developed and honed accordingly 
the things and lessons we give children should be more gender neutral and earlier education should attempt to ensure 
all people are shown as many thingssectorsideascrosssections as possible whilst you gave great examples of historical plight of women 
blacks in america in the uk where i live the largest proportion of the poorest of people are white 
my partner works for a uk charity and they provide money and help to impoverished single women the charity 
existed for around one hundred fifty years and they do great work however all the societal data that they 
always shows that impoverished white males iwm are the worst off in the country iwm get the least assistance 
obtaining higher education have the largest drug addiction issues highest suicides lowest income etc etc et all literally in 
opinion the poor are nudged far harder than any individual woman away from education and from trying to develop 
hopes and independent ideas i being poor have only my dreams i have spread my dreams under your feet 
softly because you tread on my william butler yeats wealth privilege is the real privilege their are plenty of 
males who discrimate against other white males because they sound stupid appear to have a low iq come from 
poorer background etc etc there is a black privilege too according to the general idea espoused in public it 
as interesting to the current zeitgeist as white male privilege also please misinterpret me nonwhites and women in general 
definitely been mistreated by rich whites and males accordingly but equality is for all and all mistreatments and issues 
be equalized and repaired in the fairness of time also regarding your discussion on empathy listening empathy often people 
to themselves misinterpreted information and know their own position either as they are undecided or have not yet determined 
variables so expecting the limited small mouth noises we use to communicate to be an acceptable tool for determining 
is incorrect the dictionary definition of empathy is ability to understand and share the feelings of in my opinion 
is done by placing yourself in their shoes and placing them in yours you can have and do develop 
empathy for things and people you have nor will never have the ability to speak and listen to listening 
be part of empathy but it in no way defines what it means to have it empathy should always 
directed to all those we consider our lesser and also to those we consider our greater friends and enemies 
should extend to animals plants and all things made from whatever this universe is and perhaps even to the 
that exist beyond the rules of this manifold the term is equality nothing else a persons belongs wherever they 
to belong male and female and i mean by whim but by their intentions and interests equality means to 
the playing field for all and stop playing favourites i think you truly are a great man and very 
enjoy listening to all of the lectures and podcasts you produce and are involved with and i appreciate you 
for releasing a podcast on the difficult and contentious subjects you discussed here also if you have any interest 
the following things if you found a way to weave them into future podcasts i would be delighted ccc 
points quasicrystals vsl lattice cellular automaton as discussed in a new kind of science based on the introductory comments 
would categorize my moral philosophy as utilitarian that said the issue i take with your monologue is the linking 
personal virtue and public policy one has nothing to do with another as an easy illustration allow me to 
abortion which was addressed briefly in the introductory comments abortion is immoral because a human life is being destroyed 
fetus is a person and not an infection nevertheless as a matter of public policy abortion should not be 
why i lived in a third world country where roman catholicism was predominant and abortion was illegal a young 
in the town where i lived became pregnant and she knew that she could not support a child she 
an abortion and found a woman who was willing to do it the woman had no medical training the 
was killed so was the young woman two lives were lost if abortion had been legal only one life 
have been lost because of my utilitarian bias i am opposed to abortion and i am opposed to laws 
abortion as a matter of public policy the moral thing to do is to encourage contraception and to find 
that are willing and able to raise children whose mothers raise them regarding the consumption of slaughtered animals i 
my comments here to the raising of those animals and climate change there is a strong moral argument for 
consuming meat or poultry from a purely utilitarian viewpoint it should be a matter of voluntary action and not 
matter of public policy then there is the intellectual dark web the idw is a consequence of political correctness 
was made to fast and by daniel kahneman political correctness resembles religion in that it is a creed for 
on the left who prefer to think fast and not attend to the arguments of slow thinkers who disagree 
the creed in part or in whole i am one of those slow thinkers writing this response will probably 
me part of the idw your monologue linked the idw with the legacy of slavery and racism in the 
states that linking was very religious of you and you are not ordinarily a religious person the moral thing 
all of us to do is to think more before we speak and before we act and to encourage 
to do the same thing changing that behavior is a very difficult first step necessary to destroying the legacy 
slavery to put us back in the geological era we had been in prior to the industrial revolution and 
improving the welfare of people in our households and people around the world the problem is not that you 
we should fight to stop discrimination it is that you say it blanketly and without absolute proof of instances 
it you just give a few personal examples and conclude that it must be true across the board people 
all sides of the idw would love to tackle discrimination at any point that it is proven to exist 
problem is with assuming discrimination and demanding rules to alter outcomes to create equality of outcome when you never 
any evidence that the outcome should be equal at any plane all you are doing is enforcing a different 
of discrimination that is unfair to right an unproven discrimination you hold in your mind the way you formulated 
statement as a pantomime of an idw advocate which was care about free speech not about shows your implicit 
and prejudgment of what is in the minds of those in it and that support it this was nothing 
a practice in showing your bias and not approaching true intellectualism bem sean carroll julgo que sou uma construtivista 
vegetariana embora prefira legumes fruta cereais a maior parte de carne a exceção de frango pato e peru questão 
gosto pessoal não opção de ser heterossexual mente aberta geralmente tento não agirjulgar preconceituosamente mas falho muitas vezes de 
concordo ficamos aquém de ser perfeitamente a força da razão é conforme refere todos podemos aprender e fazer melhor 
tornar o mundo um lugar mais agradável obrigada sean carroll extenso mas muito interessante não estou a não great 
and very thought provoking but not with you on numerous points i have been a part of the professional 
of large companies for the last forty years and have worked side by side and been supervised by dozens 
people of varying ethnicities all these companies have been bound by laws that mandated affirmative action to present the 
in the way that you stated it gives minorties the false and exaggerated impression that they are being held 
by and that is not doing them any favors we live in the most equitable fairmulticultural society in human 
multicultural and multiethnic societies are very difficult to maintain your not doing anyone a favor by creating that are 
imaginary dude i think youre in the idw and youre in denial about it your entire argument against the 
relies on straw manning individual bad or questionable ideas without recognizing that other members publicly oppose to those ideas 
only unifying ethos of the group is that everything needs to be and you say as much in this 
i was very excited to hear in the intro to this episode that it would be dealing with morality 
ethics associated with animals i presently adequately express how disappointed i was with how it was brushed off something 
particular that grated was the bit about eating your cats being not ok because of the human affinity and 
with them this is an example of humans being massively selfcentred the number of conflicting statements regarding being against 
and yet not seeing the issue with exploiting animals was very dismaying even more so when the subsequent discussions 
the idw and intellectuals quest for the truth and mentions of racism and sexism how can one not see 
connection with speciesism you mentioned intersectionality make the connection thank you always sean for your podcast in your discussion 
morality i think you set up a bit of a straw man regarding deriving from no one has claimed 
ought could be derived from the laws of physics or in the universe oughts can be derived from our 
of what we are as conscious beings these are going to be quite general rules of thumb because we 
all the answers for all situations that things have been change what is near the end of your discussion 
snuck in ideas that have everything to do with the of conscious as sam harris says and of course 
close to where your own moral sense lies case in point your discussion about killing not just about having 
or a in fact you derived ought the rule from is people want to be killled and other factors 
a thoughtful discussion which prods the listener to a thoughtful consideration of the topic many thanks for your continued 
to put science the humanities in the public space hi sean i really enjoy your podcast one that both 
me and also stimulates thought on complex issues on this episode i found that although i probably agree with 
on the vast majority of the matters at hand you did a deep enough dive that there were plenty 
things sometimes approaches sometimes assumptions that i disagree with our areas of agreement are great but our areas of 
are interesting so what going to talk about apologize in advance but my criticismsdisagreements will probably be fairly granular 
risk seeming pedantic do my best to explain why they are not pedantic with that in the first is 
general observation throughout this podcast you seem to have difficulty imagining people holding different moral views in good conscience 
pretty normal human thing but like how important to account for correct for or otherwise mitigate our biases in 
just as important in ethics right off the bat you say that you think most people who are against 
having the freedom to have abortions are really just interested in controlling bodies but there are some people who 
honest religious convictions this is a supposition that you cite facts to support which makes me think you believe 
is so obvious that it warrant offering evidence for which would imply a failure to imagine a good conscience 
yes you concede that a small number of people only for religious reason which in this context implies irrational 
hold the belief honestly maybe another explanation that missing i think that presenting the issue as if what interests 
controlling a body and what their belief is abortion is evil are competing or dichotomous is misleading and that 
that the majority of a really large number of people agree on honest ground is a bad assumption to 
without strong supporting evidence our belief and interests inform each other both on a surface and obvious way cognitive 
and on a much deeper level is true because it is expressing the relationship between belief and interest i 
that horse any further but i think worth consideration and i might circle back to it fwiw i think 
question of abortion is intellectually a much more difficult question to deal with than you give it credit for 
we can agree that a single cell be granted rights we can also agree that a born human should 
no magic which we agree then no magical moment when those rights should be granted if for the sake 
discussion we set aside the hardship on the woman there is no obvious nonproblematic method or standard to apply 
determine the demarcation point between rights bearing human and generic bundle of cells i wonder why you think such 
nobrainer i want to talk about the isought issue i really like the way this issue usually gets framed 
this any different the way presented is that we can let facts inform our moral decision making but they 
us anything about underlying moral principles or inversely as sam harris would have it we can infer ought from 
directly in a naive way i submit that what we english speakers collectively mean when we say something is 
good is an empirical question the reason why we just create a like it were a math equation and 
our moral intuitions if they match what the formula spits out if you were explaining good or bad to 
learning english what would you do like superman being nice to hurting someone cheating or if we analyse those 
which are considered good and those that are considered bad currently and historically we can actually draw some conclusions 
good behavior is that which maximizes the health of the group and morally bad behavior threatens the health of 
group this framing has the benefit of being consistent with the facts of the matter and it also gives 
guidelines to deal with morally difficult questions the biggest difficulty comes with determining who is included in arbitrary historical 
ethnic and political distinctions make much sense which is why postmodern moral relativism work of seems roughly workable if 
look at humanity as an organism a super complex one at that then moral questions can be framed in 
of how they effect the overall health of the organism in general not killing each other on large scale 
probably the largest moral good and all of our rules regarding honesty property liberty punishment and fair dealing all 
to keep us from killing each other en masse i think that from this what we mean as humans 
we talk about morality we can infer an but it is nothing so simplistic as individual well being i 
to make an important distinction here i am not talking exclusively about moral agents here children invalids pets maybe 
corpses get some level of moral consideration for no reason other than that they are part to some degree 
another of the group they are parts of the organism how does that apply to vegetarianism well my current 
on that depends on which argument for vegetarianism you present take that the distinction between not killing people and 
is arbitrary hold up unless you expand the group to include any arbitrary organism an interesting thought experiment and 
sure if i have a conclusive answer to it but my current thoughts are that we have a psychological 
emotional scaffolding that we build our morality on and it naturally makes the distinction between species and the energy 
to subvert that would need to be justified by a big advantage in the health of the organism to 
it another way at some point if the organism keeps taking on mass it might collapse under own weight 
an empirical question but one that might not be easy or even currently possible to answer the more common 
for vegetarianism is that socially and ecologically responsible andor that the current industries are unduly cruel i would equate 
first part of that to owning a motor vehicle most people know that driving is horrible for the environment 
do it anyways because not convenient to find alternatives we can probably agree that this is a nonoptimal state 
affairs we can also probably agree that prohibiting driving legally or morally is excessive we agree that there are 
range of nonoptimal behaviors that might not be encouraged but are allowed meat eating seems to me to fall 
that category regarding your discussion of the idw i agree with much of what you said but i feel 
you took the low hanging fruit there are tons of poorly formed arguments implications and just general nonsense that 
be found listening to shapiro peterson et al i think you addressed the most reasonable versions of their positions 
i find pinker to have impeccable reasoning and can find little fault with what he says i know if 
qualifies as being part of the idw but he does talk about political correctness and about gender disparity in 
and nothing you said would address anything he says on the matter in a nutshell he says that we 
should remove any barriers to women who want to go into stem but for reasons that are likely at 
partially biological less women have interest in the field pretty uncontroversial to talk about gender manifesting behavioral differences in 
other than human but it has become a bit of a taboo to talk about it in humans because 
worry that crazy right advocates or old club politicians will use it to justify gender based discrimination as ndg 
eloquently put it the facts care what you think and they also care what their political implications are they 
still facts and if we are smart we want all the relevant facts what if women just as interested 
stem jobs as men are does that mean okay to discriminate against those women that are interested of course 
however if we see a disparity in women going into stem we may not want to immediately jump to 
conclusion that the cause of this is that they are kept out or discouraged by discriminatory behavior so my 
of pinker on gender disparity in stem i also want to reference a qa after a pinkerharris discussion where 
audience member asks about identity politics and why they focus on it on the left so much why they 
on it on the right harris responded just so obviously a problem on the right does anything need to 
said about why problematic to be a white a note about moral realism vs moral constructivism i find this 
misleading framing there are rules to the game of chess a fact of the world it is a fact 
the world that in the game of chess a bishop may only move diagonally if you take a chess 
and play a game of checkers with chess pieces you are unquestionable not playing chess it is also a 
that the rules of chess are constructed it is possible that chess players as a community of people who 
on the rules can negotiate to change these rules and it can still be chess we know that the 
first version of chess rules were different than the current rules are the rules therefore arbitrary of course not 
are based on shared values chess players want the game to be nonarbitrary so that the best player will 
they want it to be challenging and complex they want it to be unpredictable not really a chess player 
probably missing all sorts of other things the point is that actually pretty easy to find shared goals and 
end up being negotiated to meet those shared goals i see this as a great analogy to ethics i 
really a disagreement but maybe it will offer some clarification to your own thoughts okay it probably a little 
i hope not totally out to lunch pretty sure not thanks again for the podcast keep listening one okay 
last and really out of my element there are two things i think that i am almost certain you 
with that concern your area of expertise but i have yet to hear a compelling response to them the 
is in really simple terms the many worlds interpretation the least parsimonious model of the universe possible you have 
assume essentially infinite numbers of unevidenced universes thoroughly possible that my question is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of 
mw interpretation but how it looks to me the second is a question about the relationship between science and 
specifically as it relates to qm interpretations it seems to me that the purview of science is to make 
that are falsifiable and to test them it is the purview of philosophy to interpret what that data in 
broader sense why it matters to me that dennett is working with cognitive scientists i see this same dynamic 
in particle physics and that seems like a bit of a problem to me sean many have commented on 
position on the idw but even though this may be repetitively redundant i think most in the idw are 
than you believe and that your statement idea that idw is dedicated to open free dialogue is not at 
borne out by the unduly critical in the last months the four petersonharris moderated video debates were published and 
seemed open and enlighting relative to many topics over close to eight hours you have debated harris and though 
may have been harris it was worthwhile if your remarks about peterson are accurate that would be bad but 
have not seen the evidence and nothing similar popped out with harris stephen woodford rationality rules offered a useful 
of those debates often garnering views you might consider doing something like that with idw if you believe they 
not being open or accurate in the future does it not seem very inaccurate to group sam harris with 
intellectual dark web a liberal who believes racism is factually and morally wrong and seems in pretty thorough agreement 
modern scientific views thank you drcarroll great episode well balanced excellent and thoughtful podcast carroll points out that neither 
nor consequentialist approaches to morality make sense there is no objective or real morality because cannot derive ought from 
moral philosophers subscribe to moral realism because otherwise they would be out of a job instead morality is constructed 
invented by people and groups morality evolves from the selfinterested need of people for rules to facilitate cooperation in 
morality evolves within a culture as the culture develops and evolves it is always contextual and there is no 
that effectively expresses a moral system taking carroll a step further i would say that morality is both subjective 
objective and emergent in human social systems carroll is weakest in arguing that the reason why killing humans is 
is because humans can conceptualize the future this seems a tenuous even specious conception on which to hang the 
prohibition carroll is clearly trying to get to a conclusion that killing people is bad while killing animals may 
be because they conceptualize the future that is just silly i thoroughly enjoyed this talk while i agree with 
broad strokes of what sean carroll is saying regarding the current issues of racism and sexism being vastly more 
than controversial speakers getting blocked from giving talks at universities which in and of itself that big of a 
i think he address the larger point of concern that some have with this pattern in that when a 
of normalcy around restricting speech or bullying people into silence is created it can lead to worse consequences in 
future the recent assault of andy ngo is a small recent example but the larger concern what happens when 
line of rationality becomes codified into laws into forms of institutional repression much like institutional racism or institutional sexism 
that we might have avoided by criticizing these behaviors in real time and preventing their normalization like to support 
above if you and eric weinstein publicly enage it will be proof that we are all in serious trouble 
you two meet on level ground and get into these details while being civil then what hope is there 
the rest of us ew was just on rogan and they talked about your story dear guardian been played 
was really upsetting to see how even you spouse proxy made it personal and ugly unnecessarily ew makes great 
about how not everyone learns or test the same and this discourages people from being in protected organizations i 
outliers like ew that follow the rulesnorms that shake up the stagnant we need people doing that but you 
him and in this podcast you talk about leveling the playing field while we are all trying our best 
shed our biases acknowledge you own too this podcast was good i listened twice because i disagree with a 
of it but it was platitudes esp harris on pronouns jp sh and the others all said use requested 
but not the point i know people that go out of their way to get their recreational outrage on 
wait to be outraged if someone guesses wrong when the pronoun is ambiguous get into the details not noticing 
shouting down and deplatforming because aligned with those goals wait until turn on you when they go to far 
you have the mob to deal with you must have seen the bw videos at evergreen why no comment 
this in this podcast be fair and cherry pick other professors out there are walking on eggshells and you 
have commented on this also notice ew on rogan talking about his support for intersex maybe start there were 
agree pretty please get him on your show keep up the good work thanks to say that the solution 
animal suffering on farms is not for consumers to eat a vegetarian diet but rather for government or industry 
ensure perfectly humane farming conditions is like saying that the solution to singleuse plastic waste is not to carry 
reusable bag but for government or industry to ensure endtoend recycling of plastic you are fooling yourself if you 
a good person because someone else somewhere else should do something to prevent the harm causing at two hour 
you say that some might go fighting for socail justice but that make you disavow them have to rethink 
whole life if their and are criminal and violent still there ally arg typos sorry at two hour mark 
say that some might fighting for social justice but that make you disavow them have to rethink your whole 
that tough a decision if their and become criminal and violent eg andy ngo still there ally really wanting 
heads like yours to prevail and calm things down is the following stuff from podcast fortyfour what you mean 
you discuss the conceptualization of the future issue with non human creatures mindscape your podcast interview with antonio damasio 
some deeply felt needs and questions for me subsequently i acquired the strange order of things have read it 
been studying it the study is far from over for me in chapter consciousness pages subtitled observing consciousness he 
the verbal track that accompanies the movieinthebrain part of consciousness this he says images hailing from the outside world 
also of necessity images that come from the he further says nonhuman creatures cannot do this prove then thirty 
later and women are underrepresented so we ought i really loved this episode and agreed with most of what 
carroll talked about i liked how he was able to admit that his ideas are a work in progress 
that he is open to discussion i want to bring up the few areas where i was confused or 
with his reasoning i liked how he clarified the idea of i agree that the or of morality must 
constructed and after agreeing on them we can then determine the rules laws which will optimize our fulfillment of 
i think one point which carroll quickly glossed over though is the agreeing and discussing of these constructed proposals 
seems that science should play a critical role in determine which proposals are better in these discussions for example 
person might propose as an axiom that we follow an ancient text because it was written by the creator 
the universe who knows what is best for humanity however with science we could show that this is a 
axiom by demonstrating that the ancient text was actually written by humans and not an omniscient deity for another 
assume that people agree that we should use an axiom where want to optimize the happiness of all sentient 
science again plays a critical role because we can then do experiments where we test which rules actually do 
happiness and which we can look at how existing rules have affected human happiness in other civilizations it seems 
should be an important part of determining which rules we follow to make society better whether that is implying 
is probably more of a semantic argument but the fact that that science can tell us how we should 
in many moral situations seems uncontroversial i think probably the weakest argument in the podcast was on the morality 
killing animals i am also not a vegetarian but i think the idea that it is justifiable to kill 
animal which cannot imagine the future work for several reasons first is that carroll seems to identify some arbitrary 
cutoff of what about humans which have a mental disability where they cannot imagine that far into the future 
seem like it would be ethical to kill them also for animals maybe your cat imagine weeks into the 
but certainly they can imagine minutes or at the very least seconds where do you draw the line and 
if your goal is to minimize the amount of lost future time then those minutes will add up after 
few years of eating burgers his argument also seemed to mention but then set aside the most serious problems 
killing animals which is suffering they endure although the thought experiments of instant and painless deaths are very interesting 
the area i found the most interesting was on the critique of the idw i know that much about 
except for sam harris i guess my thought would be that perhaps the idw is currently most fixated on 
gender issues is that these are the current issues over which wellmeaning people are being deplatformed and fired from 
jobs to me that seems more likely to the cause than they are sexist but again i really only 
listened to harris about these issues i also liked the example of comparing free speech issues over racism to 
about the soup when the kitchen is on fire perhaps a counter argument is that by restricting free speech 
these issues its actually making the problems of racism worse and not better but i think carroll brings up 
valid points and at least curious how sam harris would respond bryan sean you currently have the best podcast 
any genre two truths possibly overlooked here though all agenda groups begin with the assumption that the world is 
and needs to be fixed if one disagrees with this wrong assumption then one may comment on agenda groups 
maintaining personal integrity otherwise one lacks self awareness and are partners peas in a pod with all other agendas 
is certainly the group in which the idw falls utter lack of self awareness every single one of them 
oposing agendas are equally misguided in this regard path to hell is paved with good intentions true of each 
every agenda including that of idw and sjw always falls into preferences that compensate for weakness and play to 
strength this is what always establishes the basis for all both and groups so as imagined you get this 
going to get much worse because what you did is at least equivalent to analyzing the merits of scientology 
a very public wayyou mention it which mean that you were not aware but just in case while i 
with your point of view it concerns me that you maybe believe there can be a rational discourse on 
merits of opposing agendas i like you you quality of character is clear you do not belong in this 
unproductive antirealist podcast culture mud pit there are not any open minds that veiw the external as broken between 
antonio damasio and you mention the book of job read analysis of it job im a little surprised that 
seem to genuinely believe in impersonal persuasion and disappointed by what should be expected the primacy of ego and 
in informing world view i wanted to make a comment about the vegetarian argument i also am not a 
and i partially agree with sean argument i think ability to understand the future their own death and so 
is morally relevant however i think the argument overlooks a couple of things i think it is interesting that 
argument is framed as an argument about why it is moral to eat animals but if carried to its 
conclusion it seems to me to lead to the conclusion that it is moral to kill animals for any 
whatsoever if it is immoral to kill people because they can imagine the future while it is moral to 
animals because they a simplification of argument i see why it would be immoral for someone to go down 
the animal shelter adopt all the animals they could and simply kill them assuming it was done in a 
and painless way sean mentioned that we should take our moral intuitions seriously and i think we have a 
strong moral intuition that it would be immoral to do that and i think we correctly believe that a 
who did do that is not someone who is likely to be a moral paragon in the rest of 
lives we would tend to think there was something seriously wrong with a person who decided to spend their 
doing that we would probably label them a sociopath which suggests to me a general moral prohibition on killing 
some exceptions is a general part of our moral makeup i think we have a general moral aversion for 
but we allow some exceptions eating animals for example when we have good reason to allow those exceptions we 
food to live and meat is one of the better sources for the nutrition we need absent a good 
our nutritional needs i think we would find killing animals immoral tout court which suggests to me that their 
to imagine the future is not the only reason we have for considering it okay to eat them the 
that animals are unable to imagine the future is totally unconnected from the fact that they provide us with 
so it is not clear to me why it should matter whether they provide us with nutrition or not 
we are trying to decide whether it is okay to kill them sean mentioned that animals do not kill 
animals unless they are some use to them this is another way in which humans seem to differ from 
animals some humans just enjoying killing other animals and we tend to find such people morally suspect we say 
such people our critique of people who do not might partly be a matter of simple selfpreservation if someone 
not what is stopping them from killing me i doubt there are very many people who would find it 
okay to go to the pound to adopt animals just to kill them while also having a strong moral 
to killing humans it seems likely to me that someone who has no moral aversion to killing animals at 
is probably not someone who can be trusted to respect human life either i think the only reason you 
be disinclined to kill your own kittens is because you have an emotional attachment to them ie you would 
suffer or miss them i think you probably also have a natural aversion to killing them because you sympathize 
pity them in some sense it would seem cruel to kill them killing a helpless animals just feels wrong 
point i am making is i think the conclusion that sean has drawn from his argument is that it 
moral to eat animals but i think the argument he is using to support that conclusion really supports a 
conclusion namely that is is moral to kill animals for any reason and since that does not seem to 
to accord with our moral intuitions i suspect argument is not the whole story about why it is moral 
immoral to eat animals i am not sure if we are supposed to respond to other comments but i 
compelled to respond to this comment from jason prove then thirty minutes later and women are underrepresented so we 
this is clearly not an accurate representation of argument for two reasons first it misrepresents the factual claim that 
is making the factual claim is not simply that women and blacks are underrepresented but that discrimination based on 
and gender plays some role in why they are underrepresented second i am sure sean would agree that no 
directly from that factual claim but the only other claim you need to derive the is discrimination based on 
or race is morally wrong said differently there is no moral justification for discrimination based on gender or race 
there are really only two statements sean needs to make his argument discrimination based on gender andor race plays 
role in the underrepresentation of women and blacks in science and other fields discrimination based on gender andor race 
morally wrong it is very rare to find people who openly disagree with the second statement the statement so 
practice the disagreement about this moral question really does boil down to a disagreement about a factual question statement 
that context it is perfectly legitimate for sean to derive his ought from statement one since he is taking 
regarding statement two for granted if you think the ought follows from the truth of statement one it must 
because you disagree with statement do you disagree with statement two above if so you will need to provide 
moral justification for why you think it is okay to discriminate against people based purely on their gender or 
good if there are certain human qualities that animals dont have that justifies us eating meat then we should 
justified in eating humans like perhaps old children for example this is one of the key difficulties for the 
in eating meat whatever quality you think it is based upon you are going to find humans that dont 
it it seems you recognised this problem and then just brushed it under the table without giving it the 
it deserves i think if you were to really think about it realise its near impossible to justify eating 
but not at least some humans so i would like to know how you would answer harvard philosophers robert 
challenge as i recall it it was a long time ago i read his work if we had a 
raising human babies for food would you be okay with eating them it seems given your logic you should 
the problem of suffering was also recognised and then similarly brushed under the table when animals are killed for 
they suffer it is in a fantasy land only that they dont so again that should lead you to 
a veggie on animals conceptualising the future i think this story illustrates quite well some advanced capabilities to do 
and this may be of interest httpswwwcamacukresearchnewsmentaltimetravelinbirds brian bite on your challenge i agree with statement but statement two 
stronger than is necessary for sean to make his argument you could have a revised statement two based on 
alone new nonmerit based discrimination lowers the overall performance of that field from this new you can derive eg 
we ought to eliminate nonmerit based discrimination i would argue that your original statement regarding morality is actually a 
of the facts of the new i know carroll is very skeptical of this utilitarian viewpoint but to me 
seems far more useful dear professor carrol thank you for outstanding july podcast as always you are an inspiring 
engaging communicator and educator as a nonmoralizing vegetarian who cooks meat at home for the rest of the fam 
we do exist i thought you made a distinction that seemed a false dichotomy to paraphrase the killing of 
is not a moral dilemma because animals cannot anticipate their demise let me say that i do eat fish 
if they so darned slippery catch them and cook them myself i just want this to be moralizing in 
way let me buy you a steak dinner when in new york you also said that calling someone by 
or her preferred pronoun was making the world a better place agree can we also agree that people who 
to be called a particular pronoun wish to be called anything else by extension we can agree that just 
an animal know about to die a nonsequitur to say it makes it permissible to end that life as 
i said that it was not a moral issue whether i gave you cancer as long as you know 
it perhaps extreme but the adage that what you know hurt you falls flat it seems to me that 
rationally specially in an irrational time even though one is a speck and only proper governance can truly cure 
of our ills it is still good to do a little good we must be careful when we say 
can only act in ways that affect the larger society darned i failed at not moralizing sorry recognizing that 
life is likely to to continue living even if a nonmemory in the moment rudimentary beast way bayesan myself 
means we might not want to have such a distinction i realize your thoughts are evolving and i humbly 
to help the evolution of an intellect i admire that is far greater than my own respectfully and admiringly 
alex s hey read the comments but actually better than you think you are at talking about this stuff
