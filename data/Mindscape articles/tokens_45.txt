mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and if anything like me you have been frustrated at times in your 
with your inability to remember things once you get to be a certain age allowed to blame your lack 
memory on your advancing age but i think that all of us at any age are frustrated by the 
that we would like to be able to remember things that we have been through have experienced is a 
fact in psychology that human beings have terrible memories and they can be overwritten and you can think that 
memories are very true and so forth sc so nevertheless there are people out there who are superduper memorizers 
may have heard of these memory competitions that people have and this technique called memory palaces where you basically 
some incredibly long complicated list of information with physical locations either real physical locations in your house or in 
yard or whatever or made up physical locations you build a palace in your mind and we kind of 
some reasoning as to why true in the brain we know memories are about associations between different neurons and 
of the strongest things that the brain is able to do is locate ourselves in space so associating different 
or figures with different locations in space is a great way to remember them sc so guest is lynne 
who has a broader much more interesting take on this idea and the usefulness of memory palaces a memorizer 
a multipletime champion for the seniors division memory competitions in australia but lynne has had a very interesting career 
got her undergraduate degree in engineering she did a lot of work on information technology and education and teaching 
then decided that what she really wanted to do was become a writer she got her phd from la 
university in english as a nonfiction writer written a bunch of books on popular science and skepticism and things 
that she became fascinated with how prehistoric preliterary indigenous societies were able to pass down information so accurately even 
they write it down sc so she began to relate this idea of memory palaces and the great memorizers 
we know about to constructions that were built by these cultures before they were able to write sort of 
when they were nomadic cultures wandering around and really need to remember that much about the local terrain and 
they had developed the technology to imprint knowledge and keep it for a long time sc so lynne has 
theory which is becoming discussed in archeological anthropological circles that monuments such as stonehenge are actually ancient memory palaces 
the tribal elders or professors as i would like to call them would be able to associate different pieces 
crucial knowledge about how to live the laws of the society and so forth with the different individual parts 
stonehenge and other monuments and not just a speculative idea a theory that makes predictions and different aspects that 
says must be true and been able to argue that these kinds of ancient memory palaces are found everywhere 
the globe in all sorts of different cultures sc so a fascinating topic that we discussed both how you 
things and what it teaches us about ancient societies and then also what the implications are for us here 
now most recent book is called memory craft a howtobook how you can use these techniques to remember things 
previously written an academic book on the subject called knowledge and power in prehistoric societies as well as a 
popular book called the memory code and a wonderful combination of ancient history anthropology psychology neuroscience and education right 
right now so this is a fun one i hope going to enjoy this podcast go music sc lynne 
thanks for being on the mindscape podcast lynne kelly my pleasure to be here sc i will mention something 
is a bit of an unusual sorry you are a bit of an unusual guest for me in some 
because i had not heard of your work previously and i heard of it first through a commenter on 
internet adrian morgan who both on twitter and reddit was very persistent in suggesting that be a great guest 
mindscape and more than just suggesting your name he actually made the case he had an excellent pitch for 
talking to you would be a fun topic so i just wanted to do a little shout out to 
and then thank him for suggesting your name lk thank you adrian sc yeah and so i since i 
about you and since probably many listeners also but be different after this a little bit of background might 
helpful i just have to let people know that according to your cv you got your degree in and 
phd in lk yes a bit of sc which if my math is lk and electrical engineering i start 
electrical engineering i go through teaching and computing end in up in arts and humanities sc yeah no i 
love fun trajectories for people that are a little bit different than anything else if my math is correct 
gap and i presume you were not in graduate school for fortyone years lk no i taught for about 
years so i taught senior physics and maths and computing and read and wrote and did lots of things 
a gradual trajectory people think that all disconnected that engineering got to do with indigenous knowledge systems and memory 
all makes sense and a book on spiders in the middle there another great passion of mine it actually 
makes sense to me all about asking for logical explanations for things that some people find irrational and certainly 
fear of spiders is irrational and living in the australian bush i avoid them sc i have that fear 
know irrational but i still have it anyway chuckle lk i i overdid the cure i adore the creatures 
my work does make sense to me but other people see it as bitsy but not sc well yeah 
good a good segue because we want to talk mostly about your work on memory and the anthropology of 
and what it says about ancient societies but as sure you recognize if all you told someone was that 
to talk about stonehenge now ancient cultures had a form of wisdom that lost a certain new agey wooish 
that comes to that i want to give you a chance to let people know written an entire book 
the skeptical point of view that we should have about paranormal phenomena lk absolutely i am a rigorous scientist 
and through hardcore a foundation member of the australian skeptics and why i keep asking these questions because if 
find a logical explanation terrific i have to change my views and i have had to change views over 
and fun when your thinking gets knocked about and my thinking on indigenous cultures got thoroughly knocked about when 
did the doctorate but i always come at these things from a is probably a rational logic first and 
question otherwise and frankly the logical explanation is always there sc always the one yeah i was going to 
when it comes to your work on ancient societies claiming that you found logical explanations for these wonderful artifacts 
found everywhere lk absolutely sc and it has to do with memory and you putting your money where your 
is there too become a bit of a memory champion at the applied level as well as the theoretical 
tell us about that lk yes i get my hands dirty on everything i do so when i did 
skeptics guide i was doing psychic readings and things just to try and understand the mindset i believe that 
are stupid i believe that vulnerable or trusting and trusting and gullible frankly i know the difference so when 
came to these memory systems i stumbled over the fact that indigenous cultures and start with australian aboriginal but 
worked with native american these indigenous cultures are memorizing vast amounts of practical information everybody thinks in terms of 
got some kind of paranormal ideas about gods and things and they understand science absolute bunk lk and so 
i started realizing when they know about animals not just talking kangaroos and birds talking invertebrates in hundreds so 
study on the native american navajo shows that they can classify seven hundred insects in very scientifictype classification with 
and habitats and all the rest all stored in memory and just insects when i stumbled over that given 
my own memory is naturally extremely weak my good my poor i started asking the question the hell are 
doing and that derailed my phd topic derailed the book i was supposed to be writing and set me 
a completely new trajectory sc so what does it mean to be a memory champion there are competitions like 
spelling bee lk i lost your question there i sc okay my job lk so i started putting these 
in practice but i also entered the australian memory championships as a senior sixtyseven now i think yes about 
and so in a memory championship you memorize shuffled decks of cards strings of numbers in decimal but also 
which is my favorite event which is really weird names and faces which is something in practice i have 
lot of trouble with so developed systems for that and lists of words and so on and you memorize 
under time pressure and taken out the australian senior memory title twice now and i have trouble with the 
the competition goes over two days and i handle the stress very well others seem to be able to 
quite calm in america slightly different the competition by the end is done on stage and eliminates down to 
which would be more stress than ever handle sc oh okay so the australian championships are not in front 
a crowd lk no and the world ones either only america sc only lk decides to add this extra 
of pressure sc what makes this a special country that in right now so before we get to the 
societies that i think will be our main focus here but i think that probably many listeners are aware 
there is something called techniques for memory for memorizing either huge amounts of information or very long texts or 
they might even have heard of the idea of a memory palace but sketch out what we should have 
mind when you say that developed these techniques and so have other people to memorize huge amounts of information 
quickly lk this is astounding until i did it i could not believe that i was capable of memorizing 
vast amounts of information so a memory palace is basically a set of locations that very familiar with so 
best to start with is your house and at each location you place a piece of information and the 
the neuroscience of the brain and the research on place cells and grid cells naturally associates information with location 
for example got all the countries of the world the but protectorates as well otherwise we lose puerto rico 
places so you at start the front door so china i do them in population order not alphabetical i 
what letter they all start with i want more information sc more information lk so i start with china 
i imagine at the front door a chinese meal being delivered hot i happen to love chinese food sc 
making me hungry yeah go ahead lk and the delivering it in full chinese outfit i think the outfit 
him in is from about five hundred or six hundred years ago but not get too fussy and so 
image is very strong i move on to the next location and i have india and there i have 
book case and i look under the book case actually laid down once to watch a full bollywood production 
on down there now that stupid action only done once has got india in firmly and then i can 
all sorts of things third one is america which is where sitting right now i have donald trump sitting 
me he permanently sits at a table in my kitchen sc this was a sad choice that you made 
it used to be barack obama and i wish stayed there i get into politics but it seems to 
when the presidency changes sc we do that yeah lk and so on so i have a location associated 
if i want to add say the states of america i would create a story or use other things 
around where i am now because got the states around me and so these methods work much more powerfully 
just a pneumonic you know my very earnest man just shows path to the planets people have different versions 
it i add more information to that but this location sitting at for america got a tablecloth got the 
of the table i can add endless amounts of information so known as a memory palace the great greek 
roman orators cicero augustine back to homer all used this method because you then imagine yourself walking around your 
and you will withdraw whatever information you want unbelievably powerful always been associated with the ancient greeks lk my 
research showed that this is exactly the same method is developed by all indigenous cultures long before the ancient 
our australian aboriginal cultures and about three hundred of them currently date back to years ago and we have 
evidence of these stories being stored this way associated with the landscape at least years of landscape changes at 
end of the ice age amazing research coming out of america as well these stories are unbelievably robust and 
memory palaces sc yeah and so i guess learned something just by reading some of your stuff because sure 
was just my fault but i always thought of memory palaces as being metaphorical as being sort of imaginary 
that you built in your mind and associated with things but talking about using real physical locations and all 
different aspects of them to help you memorize long lists of things lk absolutely some people can use them 
virtually and create them in their mind i tried i think my imagination or ability to image is good 
for that but i learned first from indigenous cultures from aboriginal cultures before i knew about the greek and 
memory palaces so i actually came at it from aboriginal people will talk about country and on country country 
sacred to them and sacred be seen as purely religious and as i know your audience are all over 
nungaray is a walpiri woman who helped me a lot with this research said to me elders were pragmatical 
in our terms buggers is a term of endearment but for stubborn so not being rude lk she said 
are pragmatical buggers we have survived if they and she pushed me to look at this knowledge these stories 
told sound superficial and childlike because they are because you get the detailed stories until initiated and so hearing 
the children would hear so grounding the information in the physical landscape so much more robust and then as 
get initiated you get layer upon layer of complexity sc and how much do we know you mentioned place 
grid cells the neurobiology of this one thing been interesting to me over the course of the last year 
been doing the mindscape podcast is several times in several different ways been getting this message that thinking and 
action of our conscious self cognition and so forth is not just located in the brain not just a 
sort of spread out throughout our bodies in some way right but nevertheless there are different neurons doing different 
is the phenomenon of a memory palace understood from the neuroscientific point of view or is that still a 
lk still a frontier in some ways but fairly well understood and working with neuroscientist dr jenny rodger at 
university of western australia and looking at the neuroscience looking at these memory palaces and how they match and 
neuroscience is absolutely compelling that when we think of some memory or think of some knowledge we actually lay 
a physical neural pathway at that moment every time extraordinary but it hang around you need to repeat that 
and that association for it to build up and become robust and some things become much more robust than 
lk music is one that stays very robust so see people with really quite severe dementia that have not 
to anything play familiar music and they will respond right deep in our memory systems through the hippocampus and 
longterm memory place is the other one and the two thousand fourteen nobel prize for medicine went to the 
who looked at the relationship between place cells and grid cells and so on and the way we memorize 
if we look at this table and think doing called in neuroscience a temporal snapshot i am putting two 
at the same time and therefore associated so you get a lot of parents say did that happen oh 
child was about and work it out that way because got a temporal snapshot so instead of letting it 
naturally using memory palaces actually forcing your brain to do what it does naturally and then reinforcing it sc 
makes sense that our brains would be very good at remembering where we were in space and therefore associating 
with that i sometimes wonder not in this context but appearing to me now has the invention of computers 
our ability to figure out how the brain works because the computers that we build work in different ways 
in a computer the ability to remember a file has nothing to do with an association with some other 
of information but our brain naturally does that it kind of makes sense in retrospect lk oh my poor 
wants to go two directions at once at this moment firstly socrates worried about writing he i hate to 
but he would have thought of google but he warned that writing and plato wrote this down socrates we 
no written records from socrates but we have plato writing down these arguments and he argued that if we 
on writing we would stop using our memories and stop learning how to do it and so that warning 
from way back then but memory palaces were obviously all indigenous cultures teach these methods and it was taught 
classical times in greece medieval renaissance all taught formally and then we dropped it now if you add technology 
well we are relying on secondary memory storages all the time lk another whole aspect to this if you 
google or something and i love the internet and google get me wrong but you are narrowing down to 
you already know to look up i understand i used this how a memory palace would change that so 
you just got ten kilometers of memory palaces in action sc my goodness lk but stick to my countries 
which is one of my shortest got all the countries and as you walk around you start to ask 
got it in population order so china india america indonesia brazil pakistan bangladesh bangladesh is coming in just with 
before japan before germany not before america before all the european countries that have had so much impact on 
history and that we know so much about if you compare italy right up the garden and bangladesh is 
here so my brain starts saying why do i know so little about bangladesh why with this massive population 
had a massive impact colonized other countries so you start asking all those questions now a much younger country 
it got the resources been at war all the time but i know any of that getting this big 
that has started me doing that now if i listen to the news and anything comes up about any 
like some much smaller country i know about its population i can guess its population approximately but got a 
and so suddenly interested in all this stuff that would have just passed over before sc and this is 
a lesson because i think that some people are going to think well memorizing long lists of things is 
parlor trick but one of your lk no sc is that making all these associations is really a form 
knowledge not just something that replaces a wikipedia page lk absolutely because you start seeing patterns which the brain 
naturally but got a ground of information so got all my countries in the world i also walk through 
i started million years ago pointing now which is no use to you but still pointing at the front 
which is the hadean era and do you realize it took me about four years of doing this before 
realized i should call that wall which sc oh there you go lk you start making these associations some 
are a bit quicker than me i walk right around the block one way and end up back here 
one thousand bc and then i walk the other block got it all time scaled out and get back 
at today well at then i go round the garden and end up with today so i have a 
for every moment in time and every place on earth and i hook them on but things will get 
into more than one location and you start messing around with it and then all sorts of other methods 
all starts meshing and when people think of these memory methods in terms of just the competitions they have 
very neatly categorized but indigenous cultures neatly categorize they mesh everything together so your landscape memory song lines called 
australian pilgrimage trails in america ceremonial roads in the pacific they are one form but then you sing and 
and perform in ceremony which is a knowledge reinforcement reinforcing those neuropathways which is why indigenous ceremonies are so 
to be repeated and so lots of methods get meshed together sc yeah i mean part of it is 
association with places but like saying the i presume that other senses right touch and scent and so forth 
be associations we could take advantage of when trying to remember things lk okay now going to bring out 
prop this is a really really good one but have to describe it or i will this you can 
what you see this is actually a model of an african lucasa from the luba people of the congo 
are none of the real things in australia but america has a couple in museums and i examined one 
the brooklyn museum in new york and this is based on it but adapted for my knowledge so what 
is do you want me just to describe or sc so holding up something that is more or less 
size of a book and some backing material that decorated tell us what the backing material is and what 
decorations mean lk okay the backing carved and tortoiseshell pattern and the luba people well documented used that as 
memory aid but the front is carved with different carvings and shells and beads are nailed on and in 
research i read that they encoded to this little bit of handheld wood they encoded a complete history geography 
essentially a knowledge system an encyclopedia and i thought well a skeptic i believe this sort of thing sc 
me yeah lk at the time i know enough about it so i grabbed a bit of wood and 
holding up a different bit of wood which is actually a bit of wood from just a square bit 
rectangular bit from when they were building out veranda which now pointing to which is again useless to you 
i just glued a whole lot of shells and beads onto it to see if this would work and 
started encoding a field guide got it upside down a field guide to the victorian birds laughter that matter 
your image it does for me describing it so i then started encoding the four hundred twelve birds native 
of my state of victoria sc so we have a block of wood in front of us show a 
of it on the vlog post for the podcast if people want to see it and it looks like 
that you would sell in a store or as a souvenir of the local color but saying a code 
lk absolutely sc and to you an enormous amount of knowledge encoded in those shells glued on that piece 
wood lk right i start with the emu at the top but go to the second bead what you 
able to see is that a little tiny speck on it when i look at that i can see 
duck tail wagging so this bead represents all the ducks and i look at that and not see the 
tail wagging and a little gnat next to it another little speck which in my mind is a gnat 
gnat a day are the ducks sixteen ducks to be memorized now the first one relates to a magpie 
about the fifth is the swan magpies and swans are two of our main football teams so i have 
story linking them all of a football match that goes wildly out of control so the australasian shoveler is 
all the dead the musk duck these are australian birds the musk off in the bushes using his musk 
for matters we discuss the bashing everyone up so got a story that gives me all the ducks now 
believe at all that the shoveler really buries dead but that story gives me the list and then i 
start linking more and more on i could not believe how effective this is and a lot of people 
tried it since reading my books and are finding the same thing and using this with kids of four 
sc now does this mean that you choose which shell to glue on there because going to want it 
represent something specific or is it a case where almost any noticeable thing about the shell you could turn 
an association with what you want to remember lk you can i just did this randomly i at that 
even decided what i was going to encode to it when i did it properly the second time with 
one that looks like the real lucasa i did lay out this is a history of writing from proto 
right down to contemporary scripts and that is laid out that little thing an inca khipu and not a 
device that was laid out and that makes it an absolute fludge but even if you stick to something 
has no patterns linked with it it will still work very well because your brain will make those links 
up here i dribbled the glue down the side not really good at craft that happened to be where 
lyre bird is and menuridae so that looks like a urinated down the side of my board sc there 
go lk vulgarity violence will always work well as memory devices sc the brain remembers those things yes lk 
is why mythology which are actually encoding pragmatic knowledge what a lot of my research is about mythology has 
wild characters vivid stories lots of violence and sex and vulgarity because the brain unfortunately i have to admit 
those things very well sc none of this seems like it would be helpful in memorizing a deck of 
with a bunch of ones and zeroes on it do you have to be a little bit different when 
these realtime competitions lk not really abstract objects like numbers and cards have no action no meaning no emotional 
so what you do is you give a character to each of the cards my ace of spades is 
my two of spades of pythagoras now homer and pythagoras both wear togas so that became a problem so 
converted that over to homer simpson sc there you go lk now got homer simpson as my ace of 
my two of spades pythagoras measuring out triangles and things just take the eight of diamonds is now a 
for me if i get those three in a row i will have homer simpson measuring a snowman now 
an active image and i place that in the first position in the memory palace when memorizing a deck 
cards creating characters as a story and characters if i can get nothing across more than this if you 
character and create character out of abstract objects that makes them come to life and you can then create 
images sc and the greeks clearly did this do we know that they did this because they said that 
did this lk absolutely sc or we have records of the greeks explaining how to memorize big things lk 
they cicero in particular wrote quite a lot on memory and at the time he was very famous for 
writing on memory yes grammatica was the character that taught grammar and bashed you if you get your commas 
and things except i think they used commas spelling right and so so yes they created characters for all 
and those memory booklets and pamphlets and that have come down to us and were used right into the 
the same memory palace methods for using palaces characters stories and so on so absolutely they sc before it 
handheld devices but really just a miniature memory palace it works in my brain exactly the same i take 
with me when we go birding and i memorize listen so for example we see a honeyeater and not 
sure which one it is honeyeaters are our biggest group of birds here thirtysix of them i can reel 
the so we can do it by process of elimination but i take this with me i know it 
well that with me in my mind all the time sc and techniques maybe fell out of favor once 
and reading became more widespread once we had books to download our knowledge on to lk once really got 
and that they stopped being used as much but in the medieval times when books were very rare they 
used all the time and books were designed by this principle why the medieval manuscripts which were designed to 
memorized have all the fancy stuff around they left space to add comments in all the time to keep 
with it to add little drawings if you look at tibetan mandalas and chinese narratives scrolls got a whole 
of ways where the memories are put into images now i can read a page of a book when 
and at the same time be working out what i want for dinner and what i want for dinner 
stay there the page of the book is gone i can write notes without engaging with them because there 
be words i know i cannot convert that into a story or a picture or an attachment in a 
palace without actually engaging with the information because i have to shift the mode of information lk so exactly 
they were doing these cultures all over the world transferring into art so you may have got the hint 
me now that i believe that art and music should be at the heart of our school curriculums not 
peripheries and should serve the whole curriculum and my teaching was all physics and maths and it so not 
promoting my own subjects promoting something that i wish i had known earlier sc well so the greeks did 
the favor of handing down this knowledge to us but a lot of your work has been advocating the 
or discovering the idea then exploring it that many many other cultures did this as well so tell us 
how you began to think that a lot of things that archeologists thought of as monuments or works of 
and so forth really had this functional purpose of helping primitive societies remember things lk i know if you 
about obsessions but when obsessed with something your brain think anything else i had no interest in archeology but 
husband damian was really into archeology and had just finished an archeology degree his third or fourth degree he 
collecting them and we went to england i was researching indigenous animal stories he wanted to go to stonehenge 
i traipsed along and standing there looking at this circle of stones in minds when i say stonehenge think 
those great big sarsens the huge ones but they come for five hundred years at first stonehenge was a 
of stones of about stones across circle are you happy with meters i convert sc meters are good yeah 
meters are fine oh good sc going to demand that my listeners be able to use meters okay lk 
a thousand circles big and small of this all over western europe but also got different versions in america 
circles at cahokia wooden circles but the same dimensions at poverty point in louisiana timber circles because there big 
so not the material that matters these set of locations so as i go to stonehenge thinking oh clever 
them no longer moving around the landscape and the people moving around the landscape hunting and gathering and doing 
land management and that were not nomadic they were mobile they moved from location to location and knew their 
well so not talking nomads talking mobile cultures sc sorry what is the difference between a nomad and a 
culture lk nomads wander all over the place not systematically mobile cultures move so our aboriginal cultures depending on 
they are might move between two or three camp sites or even only one over the year down south 
a lot more depending on resources so they know their landscapes sc right a bit of a trajectory seasonal 
so forth lk yes exactly so they know that landscape really well if going to settle for farming you 
say settle today and start going to starve very quickly so evidence in the archeology which i can waffle 
for hours on how they gradually moved down but these circles of stones and circles of timber that are 
over the world only appear in that transition time so at stonehenge the cursuses beforehand like the stonehenge cursus 
which is a huge area that ceremonial area and it gradually got smaller until you get stonehenge with these 
of stones so if you think of that as a memory palace nothing is going to work better because 
they brought blue stones over from wales and it looks like it was actually welsh cultures but the blue 
are very mottled in that and you know if you look at a stone or a cloud or anything 
will see whatever you want to see there and they were all different so they were actually setting up 
memory palace that was what my brain said sc so before you thought had that thought not a stonehenge 
my impression is that people have the idea that it was some sort of astronomical or crop planting device 
you really have a totally different theory of why it was put there lk what saying is absolutely true 
my theory encompasses all this because they must have some way of timekeeping if going to plant crops you 
know where you are in the season if going to hunt resources and they must have still been collecting 
resources while they developed these agricultural skills so timekeeping is essential and we know the indigenous abilities to use 
sky and astronomy over the year for timekeeping the american pueblo people are really topnotch astronomers and western astronomy 
learning a lot from them our australian aboriginal cultures have a very strong tradition of astronomy so one of 
ten points i look at at any of these monuments of whether it would be used as a knowledge 
the spiritual all there too not denying that but not going to be able to be spiritual if not 
lk so those ideas of the practical knowledge which is my field is all there here got a memory 
a line to allow you timekeeping with ditches around it with flat bottoms nobody before has explained why is 
bottom of these ditches flat so the ditch around stonehenge it varies in different bits around it but about 
meters deep now the weather in england is appalling and we know that the major ceremonies were held midwinter 
a whole lot of evidence for that and if these the imperative is to perform them or you lose 
information two meter deep in chalk with a flat bottom you can cover that evidence of how they did 
cover that with hides and so on and ensure that you perform that ceremony in white chalk the resonance 
be beautiful the reflections of the torches and a flat bottom allows you to perform lk if you look 
the associated stonehenge stand alone so start with stonehenge with its circle of stones and about five hundred years 
that moved into the center and the great big sarsens that more familiar with the huge stones with the 
on the top are put around them indigenous cultures all have a lot of secrecy and restricted knowledge the 
they have restricted knowledge is that otherwise got the chinese whispers effect and the knowledge will be ruined lost 
now got the stories here as mentioned from years ago that are held accurately got the same from native 
and africa a lot of my work comes from africa too on this accuracy you must have secrecy in 
to only the people who are trained in the songs that store the information can actually have to be 
constantly and they will not share that sc so in some sense if you are just casually knowledgeable about 
particular memories you might distort them a little bit and it would get degrading over time entropy the second 
of thermodynamics would kick in which both familiar with and so what saying is that a technique by restricting 
knowledge to those who are really dedicated to it you could maintain its purity in some way and keep 
as you said over thousands of years which for a prewritten culture is pretty impressive lk astonishing one of 
best studies i looked at was of the corn stories of the pueblo people now that they have about 
subvarieties of corn done in different colors so the corn maidens and the corn mothers are the different colors 
the corn now corn crosspollinates like you believe they have kept these pure we know for centuries probably a 
longer by having all these ceremonies restricted so that the yellow corn is planted at a particular time from 
white corn from the other corn kept at a given distance and then the ceremonies that the elders in 
of the corn will select the very purest kernels to be kept because you have a monoculture the southwest 
the united states is a harsh climate say you put all the yellow corn and isolate one in and 
had a season that was really bad for yellow corn you just wiped out your whole population so they 
this whole set of clever use of corn that ensured maintenance of a culture brilliant stuff sc so you 
remember the culture the tribe or whatever could remember things events and how to deal with them even if 
events had not happened in the memory of any living person lk absolutely and therefore put into ritual and 
and rules and ethics and behavior of the culture that absolutely enshrines these methods and keeps their corn pure 
brilliant stuff sc and so they have books or they maybe even have epic poems not quite sure what 
had but saying that at a place like stonehenge the elders or i know the professors whatever lk elders 
elders professors yes sc elders they would go at regular intervals and do these rituals and that would perhaps 
their apprentices also lk they will be teaching yes sc and so you can imagine that there is this 
of song and movement with the different parts of the memory palace to keep this cultural knowledge being transmitted 
lk and you would perform those rituals at the appropriate time in the year so one part of stonehenge 
in the ditch piglet skeletons ninemonthold piglet skeletons and we know from all the agriculture that midwinter which was 
they had the main ceremonies now a piglet skeleton was buried and then hundreds of years later another one 
put into the wall of the ditch so that would have been the time where all the husbandry of 
and possibly other animals was taught and so those skeletons would have been used as part of the ritual 
part of teaching lk but then it gets amazing once got these big sarsens in i had a problem 
because one of my conditions is there must be public performance spaces and restricted performance spaces and stonehenge became 
restricted but up the road at that exact time exact archeologically within years though not talking long time durrington 
was built and this is walking distance up the road this massive henge and the ditches two meters deep 
were ten meters deep and they have any tools other than stone tools or deer antlers red deer antler 
the ditch goes for a kilometer talking a million work hours and up now people have not had a 
why they would do this now indigenous people do not do things for no practical reason incredibly practical so 
the performance side can you imagine the acoustics and vision of it like a bathroom ten meters deep the 
and acoustics and visual i want a henge ditch i desperately want one nagged my husband he refuses to 
me one but it must have been extraordinary and then got post circles got and handheld devices the other 
sc and does it matter what the particular shapes of the stones that form stonehenge or anything like that 
or as long as all the stones are different you can imagine associating them with different memories lk the 
that matters so if you look at avebury which is the biggest of these stone ones in england which 
has the massive ditch in there the archeologists note how they seem they called them male and female but 
stones next to each other are as different as you will get but i also took the fact that 
handheld devices the african lucasa aboriginal churinga i started to put these together and found them in every culture 
my logic said therefore they must be in the british neolithic as well and yes chalk plaques called enigmatic 
objects so chalk plaques are little lumps handheld not that little of chalk with you know decorated abstract decorations 
better because you could add more meaning to it lk up north in scotland carved stone balls so these 
stone balls the right size to be held in the hand with knobs and carvings and things on them 
nobody had a theory for them i showed a picture of the most elaborate one the towie ball to 
aboriginal elder and he said done their churinga in spheres that now let me tell one of the great 
of the world no one has been asking indigenous people what these objects might be used for american archeologists 
but in the british british they have indigenous cultures hanging around to chat with sc yeah yeah and it 
seem to be from what said what implied pretty universal somehow a natural thing for people and societies to 
building these kinds of monuments this combination of big monuments with small handheld things to pass down knowledge from 
to generation lk yes find that all over the world in that transitional stage early agriculture as soon as 
get a big society really big your skills set your knowledge elders your professors start to get specialists so 
is then shared between them so in order to hold power you then need to claim some connection to 
supernatural that ordinary people have and you start to get a priest class emerging which you find in indigenous 
so they talk about worshipping these ancestors and kachina the pueblo kachina and so on they talk about learning 
them the stories they tell really like the greek gods gone back a bit more they have much more 
and character and flaws and everything that we can learn from so you then get and the monuments all 
disappear stonehenge knocked down or anything it just stopped being used the same with the big circles at poverty 
in louisiana and the big mounds are used a lot in places that have big stones sc i had 
wonderful podcast with marq de villiers on the origin of the idea of hell and he was partly having 
hell is a fun topic to talk about but suggesting something pretty dramatic if not overinterpreting it so let 
restate it and you can tell me if on the right track back in the day when it was 
to remember things for a very very long time but we have writing or anything like that we constructed 
tools memory palaces and handheld artifacts to help us remember things and we would attribute this knowledge to our 
since they came up with it and we would pass it down for many generations but then over time 
our society gets bigger we begin to mythologize those ancestors and even supernaturalize them before it was just our 
told us this they were really good thank and then it becomes where almost worshipping our ancestors and maybe 
is the origin of religion in some broad sense is that okay lk i have thought that way and 
who have suggested it before i used that in my doctoral research and my books because adding a level 
controversy and at this stage i want to do that sc why podcasts are good lk yeah and i 
plenty of evidence for that actually examples from native american and from māori the māori can trace everything back 
hundred years they did things a little bit differently from everyone else get to that in a moment the 
zealand māori this is a universal thing and i think that you can trace religion back that way and 
can see in particular in the greek and roman myths where they associate things with landscape the gods all 
on particular mountains and things but they gradually start to worship them that this changed there and i think 
to do with power lk my phd thesis is titled when knowledge was power unfortunately these days i think 
and religion and money is power but we get into politics just this moment most cultures use the landscape 
then add in complex genealogies and this is an area that has been too complex for me to replicate 
to replicate most of the others but our australian aboriginal cultures will relate every single person in their culture 
everyone that comes in from associated cultures into a complex genealogy map māori do it the reverse they use 
genealogies as the basic indexing system this is what if not indexed on the internet you find it all 
systems are indexing systems knowledge systems with a complete link anything not linked to a stone is going to 
lost so the māori sc i can see your computer science background peeking through here lk actually an information 
theory stonehenge is a database structure with the data all stored in memory it just happened to be human 
that died so really what it is and i do have an information technology background so the way i 
if you have information indexed lose it you must so the māori index on genealogies they can go back 
hundred generations so when you look at the mythology there are examples from the pueblo and the navajo and 
māori of how those are living ancestors go back far enough they become mythological so the question are the 
biological or mythological is a question that be answered a western question because it a significance to the indigenous 
because both so got stories of the pueblo adding in a kachina a priest the priest killing kachina who 
around with a head telling the story of the pueblo revolt and when they beat the spanish trying to 
over their lands the pueblo are still on their own lands why such a valuable culture and their knowledge 
so important lk so they will add in stories they will add in characters with time they may become 
a division that matter so got donald trump sitting here for america for me but he will become mythological 
the real donald trump sc a technique yeah part of a story in posteuropean cultures in european cultures and 
ones descended from we always lament the loss of the great library at alexandria but what saying implies that 
lot of these european explorers and conquerors as they wiped out these artifacts from primitive civilizations were destroying libraries 
a very real sense lk absolutely in australia if you use the term primitive referring to aboriginal cultures you 
be in big big trouble so nonliterate or oral sc yeah tell me that i want to do it 
so please tell me yeah lk because especially what trying to say is these were extremely intelligent they had 
same human brain and still have as we have but they stored information differently if talking australia two hundred 
ago the british came here and took land they were doing exactly that burning down the encyclopedias so the 
physical cruelty to aboriginal people and the massacres and so on was horrific the intellectual cruelty was just as 
they would put fences across these song lines and shoot anyone who came in because it was agricultural land 
so we know from the yanyuwa people right up the australian north that very few elders left now so 
is knowledge that is very hard to get but they have eight hundred kilometers of song lines mapped out 
elder can sing eight hundred kilometers of locations can navigate them and can associate all that information with it 
say a little bit more about what a song line is in particular as a particular technique lk a 
line is a memory palace in the bush but sung because song is more memorable so sung knowledge tracks 
american sing and dance because these are more memorable events so they will sing these tracks through the bush 
people who come to australia and decide to go out hiking in the bush can get lost and die 
meters from a path because our bush is very dense and any bush got proper wilderness there in england 
bit harder they have any proper wilderness left but to navigate eight hundred kilometers and navigation paths right across 
whole of australia talking kilometers no not get ridiculous got these navigation tracks that go all over australia sung 
memory so they can teach somebody else to sing the track and navigate from a song so why called 
lines sc yeah it makes me wonder what are the kinds of things that were being remembered this way 
maps and locations and probably plants and animals are obvious ones what other kinds of knowledge were there more 
kinds of knowledge like customs and laws that were passed on lk absolutely but also got a lot of 
things like water holes in australia the driest continent on the earth they go right across the desert so 
want to know where the water holes are how to find the best flint for napping and so on 
also all the cultural there is a huge base of ethical laws and i have read so often that 
and ethics and everything started with the greeks and started with literacy that is highly offensive to indigenous cultures 
they have very detailed ethical cultural responsibilities which keep them going without them so got stories you talked about 
of the scary stuff the bunyip stories here and the scary that stops children wandering from the camp because 
fence them but if got stories of the bunyip out there not going to leave mum and dad lk 
although there are all these other aspects to being a scientist i focus on the absolute pragmatic and so 
of that i run out of stuff to research sc well you had this wonderful example that i saw 
the loon or the redbilled loon maybe that helped sailors or helped people out on the ocean find their 
back lk okay the redthroated loon sc redthroated loon close lk yes some cultures call it the diver but 
native american up on the just checking my northwest coast in canada have these and they have totem poles 
the loon pole now the loon is a particularly interesting bird not particularly interesting to look at not a 
bird now pelagic birds are water birds that will go out like albatrosses and so on and stay out 
sea forever the loon will always come back to land at night so if you do your hunting magic 
i hate that term because it implies nonrational when before the cultures that used the loon and used right 
the north of the world they will sing the call of the loon before they go out and say 
that saves lives because it does if a storm comes in and all the water birds will be making 
racket if you can pick out the loon call and follow that exact call you will get back to 
it might not be where you want to get but you will get back to land and be saved 
it the redthroated loon in particular other loons that quite as good so if possible get the redthroated because 
will not stop calling the whole way back lk so before say our aboriginal people go out hunting they 
dance the behavior of the animal hunting like a kangaroo because without guns you have to get fairly close 
you want to alert it and you want to yell out fred the over so they have all sorts 
communications systems which they dance before they go out on the hunt to get their strategies ready and their 
techniques ready incredible stuff sc this is the kind of knowledge the sort of local knowledge that you absolutely 
that you can imagine should be passed down from generation to generation lk yeah it has to be reinforced 
just teach a kid and then let it go and think going to remember it when they need it 
years later sc so it seems perfectly reasonable to me that structures like stonehenge were used to keep information 
were libraries of a sort but presumably going to guess there are people who agree how do we know 
at least how do we judge whether that was it is it a sort of consistency check is it 
matter of being able to fit other pieces of data into the picture that makes us go this is 
on the right lk i had anyone who agree some people think i overstate it which i probably do 
there will be all the other aspects and indigenous ceremonies do have all the spiritual and that which i 
to say they and then ignore it so i am overstating that so saying this is their primary purpose 
their entire purpose a consistency got a set of ten in my cambridge university press book on phd thesis 
set of ten tests and if i get nine out of it goes just because some have cave art 
some but then there must be acoustics astronomical alignments a set of and got tests for dismissing it if 
can find a single set of standing stones in the british neolithic that do not follow a pattern that 
can easily navigate because it must be a sequence a set of timber circles anywhere that are used in 
but also right across the americas that be navigated in sequence the sequence is not the theory falls apart 
that has never happened yet lk so what i want is all these different indicators to be in place 
that consistency is everywhere and only in early agricultural nonliterate cultures so it is a set of consistency and 
same consistency with nonliterate cultures all over the world so worked with linguists and one of the scariest seminars 
ever gave was with a group of linguists specializing in recording the languages of these cultures and if any 
these cultures did not follow these same patterns all over the world the theory would fall apart and not 
person in that room would argue but then when you look at the neuroscience just matching the human brain 
evolutionary terms talking probably only years i mean stonehenge is a mere years just a baby so no if 
find an inconsistency then worry sc do you know about the extended cognition thesis have you heard those words 
a little bit sc you know embodied cognition which claims that when we do cognition when we do this 
of higherlevel abstract thinking not just in our brains in the rest of our bodies as well extended cognition 
we should include our notebooks and our tools and our environment in literally the raw materials of how we 
and you know spiders offload pieces of knowledge into the designs of their spider webs and so forth and 
this is a form of that like really these things that we do to the environment whether a handheld 
that we make or a largescale monument this is part of our thinking capacity lk yes i sure whether 
were going into the new age collective consciousnesstype thing sc no no yeah i was not chuckle lk so 
i was hesitant absolutely research in education that a child with a computer is in fact more intelligent because 
more knowledge available to them so yes absolutely except that if you rely on it entirely a computer or 
way of offloading your memories you got something to play with information so high levels of taxonomy and that 
up into creativity and theorizing i imagine that i could do so much of that until i had this 
of knowledge in there to play with so for education advocating we bring these methods back but not advocating 
the curriculum because if you put them as our arts so for mathematical tables which people need to know 
not calculate up to them lk because what i see kids doing now if they want six eights they 
up through two eights three eights four if you create an image with a story and in the schools 
working with calling them rapscallions we call them kachina these characters and take the pueblo or ancestors or anything 
would be culturally most inappropriate we decide to call them cheekies to give them character until we googled it 
got a lot of bottoms so we went over to rapscallions so say for tables for six eights you 
an instant image lk so all sixes are sticks all eights are gates all are naughty so the kids 
had their own rapscallion and that gives them an emotional attachment they have to create an image of sticks 
gates are naughty gates so the rapscallion picks ups skip six leans on a gate and the gate knocks 
flying something like that which they paint that time commitment to the single table makes them bring it back 
and you need to do the whole six eights and eight sixes are the same so got rid of 
of them and ones you need to do because of the patterns so that commitment in time will get 
table instant sc so saying that that there are implications for early education but like you said not changing 
curriculum but introducing some new techniques and again it takes us back to the point that not just a 
trick to memorize things it helps if done correctly presumably it helps solidify the foundation of the kinds of 
that we have lk yeah take out the early education done research with senior secondary so the periodic table 
the obvious one you whack it in a memory palace every fifth location the ancient greeks said make every 
location a sequence so they can get the number the atomic number easily every noble gas they would bow 
so when the kids come up to number neon is a door because a they need it and then 
bowed and apologized because noble gas kill themselves laughing neon noble gas number ten is in and from that 
got it as a noble gas they can go forward and backwards and get its position and its behaviors 
sing the lanthanides lalalala lanthanides they act out the actinides which gets very explosive all radioactive protactinium they keep 
as a prostitute i wish they add that in very interesting so that sort of thing for seniors done 
with art stuff lk got an american world memory champion the alex mullen mullen he and cathy chen his 
are medical students and their website mullen memory shows how using all these techniques in studying medicine at university 
so on so this is everywhere and right through life because how much of a whole lot of dementias 
how much of dementia is that we stop laying down memories and identity so instead of singing love you 
love you lost you i live without which we tend to sing nonstop why we singing knowledge as indigenous 
do and that music is one of the last things to go why we creating devices that are a 
of our life so that there is our identity and been doing this with some people here and you 
how kids object to heard that umpteen times that story umpteen times if got it on a memory device 
they point to it the kids want to tell you the story and creating an heirloom lk and the 
using here in workshops here are based on the native american winter counts of the lakota people where they 
history done on hides they work wonderfully so early education yeah and keep it going right through life sc 
okay so for someone like me you know a physics professor not really used these techniques very well i 
that i remember in one of the things read about you you claiming that before you learned these techniques 
were not very good at memory it was really lk appallingly bad is the answer sc appallingly bad so 
you the chance to make the sales pitch if one thing one thing that would help convince me that 
is a set of techniques that i should study going further is there something in particular i should try 
either learn or help myself with or just give a whirl to lk i think grounding the definitions is 
important so i did a physics experiment with a whole group of kids that force was the topic that 
were to do all of them and then talking fiveyearolds up to because of the way rural schools work 
and the curriculum so they did all the experiments with balloons going everywhere and so on and at the 
i quizzed all seventy students said you remember doing force in is a three out of seventy told me 
was a push or a pull lots told me when parents make you do things you want some told 
what makes the balloon go across the room and half of them said the force be with and as 
physicist you will know that is not good physics sc we hope not the first answer they give yeah 
lk right which means as those teachers are going on saying force this force those kids are not basing 
of that information on firm foundations so the music teacher took the imperial march from star wars and created 
little song saying a force is a push or a pull push or pull i do it without the 
as you can see doing the actions the kids sang it in music and then assembly then not mentioned 
a week seventy kids the same wording of the question you remember doing force in seventy out of seventy 
me it was a push or a pull did the actions and started laughing therefore not saying we sing 
we sing or dance or perform or memory palace the absolute things we need grounded we must know what 
force is or else everything we do from then on is based on sand sc well a good message 
room for the human mind and brain and memory recollection possibilities even a world where we can all type 
into wikipedia or google very very quickly lk absolutely and fun they really are sc and fun the best 
okay lynne kelly thanks so much for being on the podcast lk an absolute pleasure sean music this was 
terrific podcast an educator a historian and a science geek and so many aspects of this conversation are right 
my alley thank you fascinating podcast i first realised the natural tendency to match information with location when i 
listening to audiobooks and podcasts while walking i discovered that walking in the same places later brought back memories 
what been listening to there months previously stuff that never have remembered if asked i now find that simply 
a particular walk will bring back snatches of the material i listened to an involuntary memory great listen and 
how the swirling symphony of consciousness seems to work with memory in this case my impression is that many 
esoteric practices across the board involve the deliberate association of disparate elements sensory spatial etc to consciousness which would 
be subject to natural selection pressures like everything else great point on extended cognition guest suggestion would really like 
sean to interview james c wathey who has written on the biological roots of the religious impulse which could 
some of the points raised here i loved this episode thank you i had been wondering about the use 
plays as mnemonic devices and found this interesting paper connecting hamlet with the ars memoria i think relevant to 
discussion so i thought link to it thanks again lynne and sean for the great information hamlet as emblem 
ars memoria and the culture of the play i loved this episode even more so than the regular mindscape 
because it gave very good explanations to things i had previously wondered about not always consciously among them why 
people cling to their land and their sacred places so much even though i know the thought was patronizing 
always had a they just move in the back of my mind seeing the land as an index to 
and cultural history makes it much clearer why they cannot give up the particular piece of land they grew 
in without giving up much of their culture the question why certain structures were built was often answered with 
been when no practical value was apparent the memory palace theory seems to be a much less intellectually lazy 
and somehow more convincing inventing godlike sagas around distant ancestors always felt silly to me no more after listening 
this episode so huge thanks for this one especially for answering questions to which i actively searching answers anymore 
finished dr mindscape episode and then listened to the podcast about how the presidential candidates use music to get 
their message and cement their message in peoples minds fascinating stuff thanx ron goren this was fascinating played around 
mnemonics and various memory techniques but had never taken it to the level she describes nor did i realize 
these techniques have been used by so many civilizations around the world for thousands of years pingback remembering the
