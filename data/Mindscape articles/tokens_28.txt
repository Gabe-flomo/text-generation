coeditor of the celebrated blog site three quarks daily click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and 
to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today talking about a somewhat difficult subject which is cancer 
how we can try to treat and prevent cancer from taking lives a difficult subject of course because i 
sure many other people in the audience are familiar with people who have passed away because of cancer the 
leading causes of any kind of death in the united states are heart disease and cancer by a wide 
these two things and i think at least informally i have any data and i wanna valorize one way 
dying over another but my informal impression is that cancer is much crueler than heart disease in many ways 
can come on people who are otherwise perfectly healthy it can appear in people relatively young i know people 
their and who have been diagnosed and the way that we have of treating it is not very good 
involves a very painful process a very drawn out long process that often fails that often even though we 
everything we can cancer still claims a victim sc so guest on mindscape is azra raza who is the 
soonshiong professor of medicine at columbia university an oncologist been doing cancer research for a long time she has 
new book out called first cell the human costs of pursuing cancer to the and as i said we 
know people who have died of cancer husband who was also an oncologist was diagnosed with cancer and it 
claimed his life so no matter how much you know no matter how expert you are in the field 
can come to get you and really nothing you can do about it so angle is that we should 
a lot of our resources from fighting cancer once already spread through the body to finding cancer as soon 
it appears the name of the book first the first cell in the body that goes cancerous of course 
people would agree many doctors many oncologists would agree that that would be great if we could do it 
the argument is that we can do it there are things that we know that would improve the rates 
which we find cancer very very early but just not putting in the resources to doing that that we 
sc and one of the wonderful things about book and come out in the conversation is that a very 
human kind of doctor and a lot of stories in the book about individual people and their struggles with 
and we talk a little bit about the fact that i would have a tough time being an oncologist 
with people who had cancer all the time but azra really appreciates it thinks a privilege that she gets 
help people in this crucial moment in their lives going one way or another so a very uplifting conversation 
the gloomy topic overall sc so this is the last mindscape podcast my last regular one anyway of i 
a twoweek break for the holidays there may or may not be another holiday message like i did last 
but one way or the other i wanted to thank everyone been listening patreon supporters especially but really anyone 
is listening to mindscape once or every single week my thanks goes out to you amazing to me that 
can sit here and talk and i can send an email to some brilliant accomplished person somewhere in the 
and say i talk to you for an hour or and they will say yes because i have this 
i hope enjoying it as much as i am and i know that i have some really good guests 
up for the schedule next year already so two thousand twenty is gonna be another great year for mindscape 
your holidays and go music sc okay azra raza thanks for coming on the mindscape podcast azra raza delighted 
be here sean sc this is just so everyone out there in podcast land knows never met before but 
have knowledge of each other over the internet for many years now part of the collective that makes three 
daily the famous blog site is that right ar yes my younger brother abbas raza is the editorinchief of 
sc and what kind of things do you contribute there ar for the last fifteen years been posting two 
daily very occasionally one and one of them is a story related to some kind of scientific news just 
released or a scientific article but the other is general interest because i have many other interests so it 
be literature philosophy music art anything sc well great about the website it really does bring things together in 
way that is reminiscent of the mindscape podcast here so that makes you a perfect guest and also what 
you perfect guest is you have a book that just came out is that right ar yes sc or 
it coming up called first and not about the origin of life about cancer and an oncologist and i 
wanna get into what cancer is how we treat it and so forth but i help but ask about 
very moving personal story that you open the book with could you tell the audience about that ar well 
book is titled first but equally important is the subtitle of the book which is the human costs of 
cancer to the so this is a book not about cancer it is about cancer patients sc yes ar 
the purpose of this book sean is to bring back the patient front and center into every discussion we 
about cancer no matter how deeply and rigorously scientific it is we have to ask the question at every 
where does the patient benefit from this or is hurt by it and so as a result of having 
goal in mind i have told many patient stories as well as patients who are in the treatment with 
right now their stories they have told in their own words but after i started to write it i 
realized that it would be insincere of me if i did not include my own sc right ar because 
going into such granularity about suffering and pain not fair to shield myself sc if asking other people to 
up in this way then yes ar exactly right and so it has been eighteen years now since my 
harvey preisler died i have never spoken about it to anyone or written about it but what made me 
out and write it and then write in as much detail as possible because what i was demanding of 
other patients and their families now this personal story became like a red line running throughout the book through 
chapter and then a whole chapter devoted to harvey you asked me to tell you something about this personal 
i opened the book with so this is the background on of why i put it there and then 
course harvey was my mentor since twentyfour years of age we later got married he was the head of 
cancer center and in an ironic and cruel twist of fate he got the very disease he had dedicated 
life to cure since he was cancer leukemia ar and he suffered inexplicable indignities at the hands of this 
over a course of almost five years our daughter was threeyearsold when he was diagnosed and eightyearsold when he 
and so in this sort of dizzying disorienting period what i experienced needed some distance of time as well 
to verbalize some of those things so in a way the book is a combination of my personal story 
that of the people i take care of and that of the disease i study so several books in 
i guess sc yeah yeah i also had a very good friend michael who was an oncologist and was 
with cancer and eventually died of it and if nothing else it reminds us that we really know so 
about the disease the people who know the most are still helpless in the face of it and something 
cancer that is especially cruel how it happens apparently randomly you can be relatively young and it takes years 
you can reach a point where not much you can do ar and the greatest cruelty is that it 
a silent killer that it can grow to an advanced stage within your body and you have no inkling 
it in fact a very very interesting study that was done some years ago sean where people who have 
longterm smokers try to quit many many times and when they finally manage to quit and not go back 
they quit go back quit go back finally when they manage to quit an inordinately high number of them 
up with lung cancer sc really ar so a study was done to show why and it turns the 
was that most likely they could stop only because something internal sc oh that was a selection effect right 
so there is something but we tend to ignore it completely and because at such a subconscious level so 
you say that something very terrible about cancer very unique about it is that it is a silent killer 
and just so hopefully many people in the audience have not seen cancer up close or had to deal 
it back up explain what cancer is not a simple even thing to explain what it is many varieties 
many manifestations ar to begin with the very simple thing is that every living cell which is normal has 
limited number of proliferations or divisions it can undergo this is known as the hayflick limit that after forty 
fortyfive cell divisions it will either undergo a process of committing suicide or be killed by other things or 
will dial down all its activities and enter a state of senescence and be useful no longer sc i 
by the way worth a podcast all by itself that fact because amoebas have that property they can just 
dividing forever so we complicated multicellular organisms have built in a lifetime a suicide mechanism for our own cells 
just fascinates me to no end but okay chuckle not get too distracted ar and cancer cells overcome this 
limit and become immortalized that they die so to me the definition of a cancer is just that that 
cell which is now capable of infinite number of divisions and what causes cancer really there are some very 
events that can give rise to it but most of the time a random event and probably i would 
at least of all cancers happen because of dna copying errors as the cell is dividing sc and is 
correct to say that one thing we do know about cancer is that it involves a change in the 
some sort of genetic mutation one way or the other ar only partly correct because genetic change is one 
but in inside the cell itself but also control of those a cellular function could come from an external 
however ultimately it is the cell gone rogue by itself running amok so in the end you are right 
there has to be a genetic component to every cancer cell sc and is it just is it merely 
it grows without bound or does the size and functionality of the shape of the cell also change ar 
as a result of the cancerous changes everything goes haywire really it serves no useful function anymore and it 
change size shape form sc when you have i guess since i know so little about this my ignorance 
going to show when you have a tumor for a sort of cancer that is stationary in your body 
that grow because the cells simply keep dividing or because the individual cells puff up or is that a 
of both ar because cells are dividing and making a big mass around them i think of cancer as 
which tends to evolve like life itself the same constraints and the same principles that apply to evolution apply 
initiation expansion growth of a cancer also so one cancer cell say divides and becomes two each time a 
divides it has to copy its entire dna which is about three billion base pairs so on the whole 
each division a cell will retain three to four new mutations now most of these mutations are passive which 
sc harmless ar harmless but some of these if one of these happen to occur in a vital gene 
example which is controlling proliferation or which is responsible for growth control which are known as tumor suppressor genes 
these mutations happen in one of those vital genes then the function of the cell is affected but then 
it now overcomes growth control because of this mutation that is mutation which will be termed as the driver 
the founder mutation so the first cell will have the founder mutation but each time it divides into two 
the problem going to pick up new passenger mutations that may not change its proliferative or doubling ability but 
can change its metabolism its response to drugs its ability to be more aggressive and dividing so much more 
than normal cells that it starts making a mass getting more and more blood supply to self becomes a 
area because it needs nutrition to help itself ar but the point is that this mass of cells now 
like thirty doublings may have nothing or very little in common except the founding mutation with the original cell 
in other words a constantly metamorphosing mutating transforming dividing selectively evolving sort of collection of cells so what i 
is that treating cancer as one disease is like treating africa as one country sc yeah laughter ar it 
a moving target because say i remove a tumor from my lung today to study its sensitivity to fifty 
and find two drugs which are very effective by the time i found the two drugs six weeks later 
of all the tests i did cancer has moved on the drug the drugs would have worked six weeks 
and this is one of the reasons that we have not been able to control advanced cancers until now 
outcome for a patient with advanced disease is no different than it was in sc is there is if 
put into an evolutionary context a biological context is there any reason why cancer happens is there some purpose 
for it biologically i have this vague feeling that elephants get cancer or something like that there are different 
about different species having different susceptibilities is there a grand theory of all this ar no short answer is 
called paradox because the idea would be that if the number of mutations increase each time a cell divides 
a larger organism should have a higher chance of having cancer right just by that alone sc more cells 
and exactly not true and not the opposite either because for example mice and humans humans should have more 
not true whales almost never get cancer for a different reason than elephants we think we know why elephants 
not getting cancer because they have twenty copies of a tumor suppressor gene called and that those genes are 
so that if one is mutated another one takes its place and another one and so tumor suppressor gene 
is known as the guardian of the genome because constantly surveying the genome for mutations and forcing the cell 
shows a mutation to commit suicide if that gene gets mutated and it stops performing its normal guardian function 
the cell can become cancerous but if you have redundant copies of that gene then the opposite would happen 
is this next copy would kick in even if one is mutated however when this was replicated in animal 
to produce to overexpress this gene or to have insert multiple copies of these genes the results were not 
great because you know what happened the animals number one get cancer but aged dramatically sc ah okay ar 
died of aging sc well i was going to ask never heard of the tumor suppressor gene and again 
an expert in this area but it sounds like we should just have lots of tumor suppressor genes but 
that simple either ar not that simple and so it would be simplistic to think that elephants who are 
animals and should be getting lots of cancers get it all because they have twenty copies of like to 
so but probably not true sc yeah very tricky chuckle so aside from the grand biological theories what about 
beings cancer is quite common on the scale of things that kill us in the world today what should 
typical american sorry let me back up are the numbers very different from the us to europe to africa 
asia etcetera ar actually no sc okay ar the only difference in numbers that appears is because some places 
good statistics others so the only numbers we can rely on unfortunately are only western countries and a few 
in asia and africa but in general wherever it has been looked at a few things are very clear 
one no age is immune from cancer so from birth to death a person can get cancer any time 
much more common as age advances sc so not just because older but because the likelihood per year goes 
when older ar i actually call it mist of to remember it easily an acronym mist stands for mutations 
just remember that by the time you are older each cell has now gone through multiple mutations so each 
has more mutations in it and if you think about this great sand pile game that per bak one 
my patients that i describe in great detail in the book came up with was that if you are 
grains of sand it forms a little pile but the sandpile after you keep dropping the sand will eventually 
the last grain of sand which caused the pile to collapse was no different than thousands of grains that 
before it it was the pile that had become unstable so not necessarily something a mutation that causes cancer 
could just be that with age many things are becoming unstable in the body so one of them is 
number of mutations have increased per cell a second one is the immune system may be a little more 
now not as efficient in eliminating the abnormal misbehaving cells sc right so immune is in mist ar yes 
then the stands for senescence which we mentioned this briefly earlier that after the hayflick limit is reached and 
dial down their activities and enter a quiescence period in which they are really not performing any more useful 
incapable of dividing anymore so never become cancerous but they have a minimal level of metabolic function going on 
stay alive so now more and more cells are entering senescence with age and what is happening is they 
producing a ton of garbage and the garbage system in the body is sc i can feel it laughter 
too young the garbage system is now becoming overwhelmed sc yeah ar and what happens then is that more 
more of this toxic material starts collecting and poisons the soil or the microenvironment in which the seed or 
cell is living so the really is not just senescence but the soil as well of the body becomes 
proinflammatory which means these inflammatory proteins cytokines are accumulating and causing normal cells to have less than robust existence 
supporting the proliferation and growth of something which is even slightly out of balance but has a selective growth 
in that setting so fitness of the landscape to the seed existing in it and the sc so sorry 
to make that clear the senescence cells as you say not the ones gonna become cancerous but they make 
the cells around them more prone to it by weakening them in some sense ar yes by poisoning the 
in which they are living poisoning the soil in which they exist exactly right and the last thing you 
one of the problems is give you the example of the bone marrow in a normal healthy adult half 
the marrow is fat cells and the other half is hematopoietic cells which means the cells which make blood 
do all the things blood is supposed to do by the time we are say seventy years old this 
changes so that of it is now just empty space which is filled with fat cells and only are 
cells so in this setting what happens is that every living cell is under the control of signals from 
cells from within itself from the soil in which it exists from blood vessels that are coming from nerve 
that are feeding on to it ar the increase in distance between controlling cells and those that are the 
the effector and the effector cells just by increasing that geographic distance you know that can also lead to 
change in for example a suppressive behavior if a cell is growing too much then it would be controlled 
it would be told not to and yet suddenly taking off so i do think that with age the 
of cancer increases because you asked me about it the same all over the and it the same disease 
over the what we see in america for example million new cancer cases are diagnosed in adults in children 
you see the difference that age makes sc there but a big difference yeah ar yeah so there is 
big difference in age but as i said no age is really immune from it sc i mean all 
facts about tangentially to this conversation but had previous conversations with experts on aging and there are people out 
who want to stop or reverse aging and this reminds us how hard it is how many things are 
on under the umbrella of what we call aging ar no i of course going to be very hard 
curing cancer is like going to cure aging basically but one thing we can target is instead of always 
after disease and treating disease preventing it sc right sure absolutely i wanna get there but just to drive 
home how important that is again for the folks in the audience who had to go through this personally 
do we treat cancer in a typical patient these days is there a standard way all heard of radiation 
and chemotherapy and so forth ar yes so the good news is that cancers we that are diagnosed today 
cured but cured with what the same things we were using like years ago poison surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy 
same things of course there are very small pockets of rare cancers for which other things are used two 
them have targeted therapies one is chronic myeloid leukemia being treated with the imatinib which is one gene causing 
problem and one magic bullet that targets it the one cancer that has been really paradigmatic in the sense 
it seemed to establish a model that cancer is a disease that is caused by a genetic change which 
be targeted by a drug sc right ar successfully sadly it turned out that for all other cancers many 
genetic mutations and no single drug seems to be working so basically chemotherapies and indiscriminate killing of normal as 
as abnormal cells and what we are still using the patients that we are not curing their outcome today 
as bad as it was fifty years ago sc and so what should we do chuckle part of the 
of your book is that of course we have all the answers you have all the answers either but 
do choose to spend our resources trying different things and you have a specific angle you think that we 
be pushing towards ar yes the angle is of course that of the first cell that instead of forever 
and trying to kill the last cell we have been trying to do that for fifty years we have 
it successfully in a very small number of rare cancers but for the majority of patients who present with 
common types of cancers gi colorectal lung ovarian kidney cancer i mean for these types of cancers we really 
a big striking blow against them in using the same poison approaches sc let i should have asked this 
but we speak of cancer being in remission we typically speak of cancer being cured right can you explain 
difference there ar i mean a technicality where oncologists insists that if someone has been cancerfree for five years 
least then we call them cured sc okay ar but otherwise if there is no evidence of even microscopic 
we only will call it remission sc and because we are never sure whether still a little bit of 
there ar yes that it may recur but after five years if it recurs the chances are that a 
cancer sc right okay fair and is if there are genetic components to turning a cell into a cancer 
is it just one mutation would be enough or do you need a combination of mutations because if the 
then you can imagine that even if you get rid of all the actually cancerous cells still a bunch 
cells left over that are ready to become cancerous they have all but one of the mutations ar yes 
answer is yes that there is always that danger so you were talking we have a certain amount of 
how are we going to spend them i think before we get into it i want to give you 
few statistics sc sure ar the first is as i said our strategy has been since time immemorial to 
rid of the cancer somehow so we see a disease sc once already overlapping conversation ar once already developed 
we see it we want to get rid of it and if we get rid of what we can 
then we still assume that microscopic disease may be present so we try to kill it with supplemental adjuvant 
like chemotherapy radiation therapy so we not only remove a breast now give her tons of both of these 
well overtime we have learnt to use these things better and that has changed but i wanted to give 
some statistics first of all patients were diagnosed with early stage disease can be cured but those who are 
with advanced disease or are going to die with the common kinds of cancers really sc that makes sense 
a dramatic shift ar yeah so we know that early detection is more amenable to treatment true for every 
the earlier you detect the better you are able to treat it before you let things go completely out 
hand now i started my career sean in one thousand nine hundred seventyseven by studying and treating patients with 
myeloid leukemia today in using the exact same combination of two chemotherapy drugs popularly known as to treat acute 
leukemia i was using then using it now can you imagine i see thirty to forty patients every week 
all these years can you imagine the same conversation with the same side effects and the same dreadful results 
and over sc honestly i cannot imagine being an oncologist chuckle i think that you need a sort of 
of will and generosity that would tax me a little bit but i give you credit for having all 
conversations ar thank you for saying that but i have the opposite view you have such exquisite sensitivity because 
listen to your all your great courses as well as your podcasts and i think you have exquisite sensitivity 
you would make an excellent doctor and we all have to do what we have to do in life 
right ar and when a human being needs us then it is actually an immense privilege sean to be 
for someone sc true ar and help them if we help them live better life we help them have 
better death we help them at every step of the way and to me that is the most sublime 
of grace that you can see the most the greatest acts that you witness and are seen in the 
of endurance that is manifested by these patients sc and a corresponding level of frustration that having the same 
with them about the same treatments forty years later ar yes sc and we should be able to do 
you think ar give one example my daughter best friend andrew three years ago at twentytwo years of age 
diagnosed because he had pain and tingling in an arm by the time he reached the emergency room he 
already quadriplegic the neurosurgeons when they operated on him found a brain tumor which they could only partly remove 
every oncologist knew from day zero that this poor chances of survival are do you know the first thing 
said when he woke up sean from the anesthesia he said was worry just call azra on the cutting 
gonna find a cure for sc oh no ar how ashamed i felt how can i ever look at 
in the manner that this poor boy i stood by his bedside realizing how badly we have failed andrew 
the question i ask myself is how many andrews will it take and to address that last point i 
to bring you up to date about andrew that three weeks before he died which was two years ago 
they brought him a form to sign donotresuscitate we call it a dnr form sc and how old was 
ar twentythree now diagnosed at how is a supposed to sign his own death certificate he sent it away 
said not signing so they took it away that night his father came over to spend the night with 
as soon as his father came he called the people back to bring this form signed it saying could 
sign it in front of my mother and this is the grace talking about that this young man dying 
protecting his mother sc well all going to die some day we all know it intellectually but you can 
certain point you reach as a cancer patient you know it in a slightly different way in a more 
way that coming and how you react how you behave says something about who you are ar definitely it 
my opinion that the kind of lonely courage that this boy and that all the patients that taking care 
really show at one point or another in the course of their illness the kind of courage that needs 
to dedicate monuments to and you know some of it is the kind of courage that harper lee has 
beautifully she says sean is knowing that you are licked before you start but you start anyway and you 
it through to the sc right ar and that is what andrew did from the start he knew licked 
he went through round upon round of chemo radiation more surgery immune therapy more chemo more radiation more immune 
more surgery he went through everything and saw it to the very end and the kind of courage that 
is what talking about after my husband died we found in his wallet a beautiful saying a beautiful line 
he had written something to the effect that know there is no good end for what going through but 
have to do it because a man and a man is responsible for sc and difficult because we either 
of narrowly as a medical establishment or broadly as a society deal very well with how to die how 
help people dying how to admit that death is coming and how to face it individual moments of courage 
grace but there is we tend to avoid it we tend to live in denial do you think think 
we can change that do you think how bad is it or is it better than i think it 
ar first i want to quote emily dickinson beautiful beautiful writer measure every grief i meet with analytic eyes 
wonder if it weighs like mine or has a different size i wonder if they bore it long or 
it just begin i cannot find the date of mine been so long a pain i wonder if it 
to live and if they have to try and whether could they choose between they would not rather you 
death is not an option death is not a choice as you say death is coming for all of 
but for those individuals who start hearing the footsteps of death approaching what goes through their minds is impossible 
us to imagine unless we are in those shoes so i think it is impossible for us to switch 
easily however one of the main reasons to write the book for me was exactly what you said that 
tired of everyone only promoting the positive anecdote as if dying is a failure dying is not a failure 
death is a failure and the main difference between humans and greek gods is that we accept mortality in 
final analysis look at andrew at twentythree he accepted mortality and is trying to protect the living because he 
he is dying but trying to shield his mother and his sister that is the sublime grace of humanity 
that is what makes my life of privilege to live ar instead of people feeling sorry that i have 
take care of dying patients they should be envious that i get to see humanity in its noblest of 
basically it boils down to are we prolonging life or prolonging death by the current techniques the question asking 
the book that if the patients we are curing today with cancer why are we curing them with paleolithic 
that belong in the stone age why are we still using chemotherapy for sake like taking a baseball bat 
a dog to get rid of its flees so horrifying the toxic effects and the patients who present with 
disease who we know we are not benefiting we are being bringing drugs to their bedside which have a 
rate of and the that are fda approved and are ostensibly great successes they should have failed because they 
only prolonging survival by a few months for a small minority so if one hundred patients are given this 
x will respond for a few months will never respond and suffer all the toxic side effects will suffer 
toxicity of the drug and financial toxicity do you know sean that today in america individuals who are diagnosed 
cancer become financially ruined by two plus years sc i was gonna ask about that i do know that 
an astonishing number ar it is untenable it is unsupportable it is unconscionable sc be one thing if then 
live happily ever ar yes not even living so why are we bringing drugs to the market or to 
bedside which are benefiting a small fraction of patients for a few days and hurting everybody and ruining not 
themselves their next generation to come so the question is what should we do then we have present patients 
worry about and then what are our plans for the future either we can keep doing the same thing 
there is some benefit to hanging on to your ideas for ever but sometimes giving up bad ideas can 
help okay we have milked the most out of chemo and radiation even for the we are curing there 
be better solutions in my opinion we have to torture people and for this we be saying you die 
cancer or you die of the drugs we give you and also be financially but we have a limited 
of resources how are we going to spend it sc actually let me interrupt you just there because i 
to let this terrible fact about financial ruin and the grim mortality rates go by without wondering about the 
just a little bit let me just put this on the table are some people or groups benefiting financially 
the current regime do they have a vested interest in keeping it like this ar my answer is not 
people but everyone is benefiting except the cancer patient why do i say this i think very easy for 
public to imagine the worst possible things about the evil pharmaceutical companies but i ask you this question if 
go to the corner drug store and buy a packet of one hundred bandaids cost you three hundred ninetynine 
or something if you go to a hospital and they put a bandaid on you one bandaid will cost 
the drug company in this equation ar and what about all the extra imaging or extra scanning people are 
and what about all the therapies that oncologists are giving to patients who they know will not be benefited 
is they will not be why we holding them responsible the question is one of them every criticism applies 
me as much as it does to any other oncologist why am i doing it when i know is 
bad why am i giving it because otherwise go to jail because a group of key opinion leaders in 
field have reviewed all the data and come up with guidelines and a good thing to try to make 
more uniform try to bring some method to the madness so that say if a pancreatic cancer patient is 
with stage four disease these three drugs will be used in firstline treatment then these three in second line 
two in third line treatment that is the guideline ar if i deviate from doing that then opening myself 
legal challenges so also giving those drugs knowing full well that it will only hurt of the people practically 
the end for a benefit of a the other thing is we tell everything to the patient not like 
are doing it without signed consent forms and they are the ones choosing it also because life is so 
and dying is so scary that most of my patients will tell me even if a one in a 
chance what do i have to lose let me sign up for it and do it so a very 
kind of system where everyone is to be blamed but no one can actually assume the blame so where 
individual responsibility end and responsibility begin these are the fundamental questions raising in the book sc and it is 
difficult if told a chance of survival a chance that you will die and your family will be financially 
saying not even gonna try to take that is difficult or more in terms of policy saying well we 
spend less because most of what spending is being wasted people are going to worry that if spending less 
doing as good a job and honestly hard to balance these ar so the thing saying that if of 
drugs we bring to the bedside are failing the first question is why are they failing because whatever we 
to bring them to the bedside is a failing model what is that failing platform where we are even 
these drugs to bring to the bedside mostly in animals or in invitro petri dishes or in extremely artificial 
that we keep insisting will be extrapolated to humans well over and over been shown that happen so a 
to simply take off the blinders and admit the truth cancer is too complicated for us to understand every 
signaling pathway and then try to fix it because it it has moved on also sc i know you 
strong opinions about studies being done on mice ar very strong opinions chuckle sc and mice are the model 
in which we test our ideas about cancer right ar so i want to be misquoted here make myself 
clear because very often i am misquoted and then i get hate mail for months years sc not from 
listeners all very sweet ar i hope not chuckle the main point i want to make is this animal 
are excellent biologic tools where we can test a large number of very intricate questions about all sorts of 
phenomenon no question about it or most of the advances have occurred even in cancer because of studying animals 
only thing i object to which i try to be as specific as possible and glad giving me this 
to explain my point of view accurately the only thing i object to is you create a tumor in 
animal treated with some drug and think now when you use the same drug in the human tumor going 
have the same results so for drug development animal models have not been helpful this is the point sc 
used all the time ar but they are used in these preclinical testing platform in fact you bring a 
to the market unless you have tested it in a mice and my question is why is that giving 
fda any level of confidence that if we see toxicity in mice we see toxicity in humans or if 
see efficacy in mice see efficacy in humans because the actual evidence is contrary to that that there is 
possibility of this flipflop exchange of information from one species to another yet we keep doing it sc do 
know about the twitter account called it takes headlines chuckle you know shows eating ice cream cures heart and 
it just retweets it with the words added ar i love that laughter yes so i got tired of 
promotion of this anecdotal person who has had remission for four years on this drug that had failed in 
the question i asked is that yes true that there are unicorns who have superb inexplicable responses even to 
therapies that have failed in every other patient and we have an explanation of why they are responding so 
but we keep taking that as the anecdote that count over and over to say that could the question 
is at the expense of what at the expense of ninetynine out of one hundred patients suffering unbearable toxicities 
one rule that we begin with is first do no harm so how can we justify ourselves in an 
where drugs are going to just harm and the that we think harm will still harm the majority of 
so instead of constantly trying to improve the typewriter we have to invent something like the word processor to 
that obsolete in order to make the paradigm shift to a better one we need to show a better 
because no one is going to willingly give up what doing sc and there is sort of a naive 
about testing things on mice in the sense that if it goes terribly wrong and the mouse dies not 
bad as it happening to a human being but i think that you have this idea that we can 
things on human cells or human tissues without testing them on human beings and maybe a better way to 
ar yes exactly well said you should be giving this podcast because you are so eloquent sc a conversation 
ar no i think exactly right that yes there are some things we do in humans that we can 
in animals but we have to do them there are the things that we can do that we even 
yet sc so how do we do that how do we test things out on human tissues or cells 
the whole human ar i think it was in i think that somebody said the best model for a 
is another cat preferably the same one sc the same cat ar yes sc they are different yes ar 
so in other words what we need is we need to test individual humans for their disease and if 
want to diagnose we know that the only thing that works in cancer is in fact dr in england 
this not the cancer that kills but the delay in treatment that kills so if we know that the 
we detect cancer the higher the chances of cure why not try and develop better techniques to detect cancer 
well this is not a new idea screening measures for cancer were put into place fifty years ago screening 
by mammography by colonoscopy by pap smear and by psa measurements these are the four most common screening measures 
and mortality from cancer has dropped by in the last thirty years not because we invented some new magic 
but sc not curing it ar no because of two things one antismoking campaigns and two screening measures even 
these four old screening measures we have brought down the mortality but these have been milked dry now this 
the maximum benefit we will get the present rate for cancer mortality is only declining by a year and 
that is happening again not because of new drugs coming on market but learning to use existing chemotherapy radiation 
better and diagnosing cancer earlier and earlier through more sophisticated imaging scanning et cetera techniques so what my point 
the book is simply done enough by trying to chase the last cell we have used artificial testing platforms 
drug development platforms these have been spectacular failures sc and by the last cell we mean the most recent 
cell in this cancerous growth rather than the first one that appeared ar the last cell means that after 
have given all the treatment you still think some residual disease may be left behind and that is the 
cell talking about so we keep trying to develop sophisticated techniques to molecularly identify the last cell saying why 
go not for minimal residual disease but develop techniques to determine minimal initial disease and diagnose it cancer early 
fact and try to prevent it so instead of using the standard screening measures i described why not in 
day and age of godlike technology cutting and pasting the dna why not develop technologies like you go to 
in bed sheets that scan you overnight for the presence of a hot spot remember i told you a 
when it begins divides faster than normal cells so it needs more nutrition it attracts more blood supply area 
hot it can be picked up by scanning techniques sc so the phrase is not metaphorical literally ar hot 
hot sc a part of your body that is higher than average temperature ar yes for example a smart 
is now in clinical trials which is fitted with two hundred nano sensors that detect changes in temperature and 
rhythm so the point is or you can sit in on something on the toilet in the morning called 
fit loo it takes part of your urine and examines it for the presence of biomarkers of malignancy that 
metabolites that may be secreted or you can do a liquid biopsy if somebody has colon cancer as soon 
cancer cells begin and start proliferating they start shedding their dna into the blood you know where it started 
it started with motherchild placental bridge because it turns out that since developmental abnormalities in an embryo increase with 
maternal age so an older women becoming pregnant has a higher chance of having an abnormal developmentally abnormal baby 
order to diagnose those kinds of syndromes like down syndromes etcetera we used to put a long needle into 
uterus of the mother draw amniotic fluid and look at it i underwent this amniocentesis when i was pregnant 
i was forty years old when i was pregnant but then this was discovered that the fetus is shedding 
dna into maternal blood ar so cellfree fetal dna cffdna is now the standard routine thing all we need 
a few drops of the blood now and we have the health of the fetus reflected in those few 
of blood or few ccs of blood the same techniques have been applied to cancer when cancer starts it 
sheds off cellfree dna cfdna into the blood and so you get sc oh okay i did not know 
and this the mutated dna that is cancer ar that you can pick up and just two weeks ago 
was announced by the company grail which is really going after early detection of cancer they announced that not 
can they detect cellfree dna reliably of the time they can also say which organ coming from so is 
coming from pancreas is it coming from the liver is it coming from the lungs based on the kind 
mutations ar so this is the beauty of very different disciplines of knowledge coming together in a consilience of 
to yield this kind of information because the human genome was sequenced twenty years ago practically but now we 
seeing the dividends of it because we know what the normal dna should look like we can pick up 
mutation we can now i mean think about it twenty years ago it took fifteen years chuckle and billion 
do the first human genome sequencing today it costs a few thousand dollars and three weeks of sequencing ar 
become efficient very quickly and i think that if we start paying more attention to these new types of 
we need to develop strategies to detect footprints in any secretion for example blood sweat tears urine stool you 
you can find biologic markers of dna for example some cancers which are beginning say your bed sheets detected 
spot in my head of pancreas one night the next morning it necessary for me to have an open 
procedure and a procedure and eviscerate my whole belly no what it means is first i should be monitored 
then taken for maybe even more sophisticated focused scanning measures to make sure that this thing is growing a 
presence if it is confirmed a real presence one thing we can do is do a liquid biopsy see 
shedding anything in the blood in the urine in the tears in saliva if we find it then we 
still do another thing we can yell at that spot how do we yell using ultrasounds we hit it 
ultrasound when ultrasounds hit this little mass it wiggles it shakes and they shed off more protein so you 
sc it becomes easier to detect ar it yells back and then you just do another test of these 
biopsies from various places and now see if detecting it and once you detect it then you really confirm 
potential lethality because it may not necessarily be very aggressive it may not need to be removed right away 
may not kill someone eighty years for another thirty years so no need to go in so all these 
of initial malignancy its potential lethality its ability to become invasive and aggressive those are all pieces of information 
can actually be investigated with the current sophisticated technology so my point is we have present patients and we 
future patients we should divide up resources into half and half half we should be dedicating to the present 
half to developing better technologies to prevent and to detect early and prevent the disease from becoming its endstage 
sc whereas right now not fiftyfifty ar no five and right now sc five percent for future patients ar 
for early detection and for present patients what we need to do also sean which i feel very strongly 
is we have to stop hurting them i mean that is something we need to stop giving everybody and 
most obvious thing to do is try and identify which patients are likely to respond to which drugs how 
you do that well any time a sponsor wants to propose a clinical trial an experimental trial they should 
made to save every sample from every patient going on that first trial and then have some patients who 
some who now you compare the responders and nonresponders using every technique you have available genomics proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics 
test by every way and try to enrich the next trial for patients who are likely to respond and 
on and so forth today the clinical trials are done the same way they were being done in chuckle 
it is horrifying to me that the agencies which have been charged with protecting patients and demanding this kind 
rigor are not doing it sc i think that this sounds very provocative and promising and so forth the 
though it is the scientific idea that i get from it that is most exciting to me is the 
of the footprints of the cancer i mean the wearing a blanket and finding a hot spot sounds interesting 
literally looking for the tumor in your body whereas the sort of indirect idea that once a tumor in 
body it leaves traces either from dna and correct me if wrong from reading your book but you can 
tracers of the fact that your immune system is beginning to fight it also in your blood is that 
way of doing it ar yes definitely in fact the best way that would emerge eventually is a collection 
all of this technology which is imaging and scanning and devices and biomarkers and genetic markers all these put 
and all being read by something no bigger than your cellphone and all the information available on this but 
even implantable devices working with biomedical engineers at columbia university on a chip that we want to implant under 
skin from birth to death which constantly should be monitoring the idea is that even the screening techniques we 
so far brought down the mortality considerably but not happening anymore because they have reached their limit but those 
done annually at best we want to treat the human body as if it is a machine and constantly 
it for even the appearance of perturbations and diseasecaused networks and you see that and you step in and 
to intervene so many of the same drugs which are failing today can be applied in earlier stages of 
disease and may be far more effective and this has been shown as a paradigm in chronic myeloid leukemia 
disease i mentioned to you for which a targeted therapy is the ideal for every cancer well in that 
itself as long as it is chronic myeloid leukemia that drug is all is curative but if the disease 
to accelerate becomes acute leukemia the same drug is useless so earlier stages the same drugs can work sc 
what i wanted to pinpoint also it seems obviously true that if you can find the disease earlier you 
a better chance of curing it but how far can we go in saying that if we find it 
very early does our chances of curing the disease go very very high or does it increase by ar 
answer is it will be more curable why because of all the statistics that are available the earlier you 
cancer the better able to cure it but the issue is how quickly are we able to do it 
then technologies will also evolve for treatment of early disease so if you sc is this a different kind 
thing to try to do than cure the late disease ar yeah totally different yes so say you have 
million cells to kill rather than one hundred fifty billion cells to kill a big difference so i think 
example if you needed radiation therapy to kill one hundred billion cells you may need just a targeted laser 
knock off a few million cells quite confidently or you can use immune cellular therapies that if we have 
biomarker we can arm the killer cells of the immune system with it and it will be able to 
then between the cancer and the normal cells the current cellular therapies we are using are unable to distinguish 
cancer cells and normal cells why the toxicities of car t therapy because it will kill every cell that 
expressing that marker which means normal cells as well as cancer cells saying that once we have biomarkers specific 
cancer cells we may have an address for the cancer cell also that is more usable by the same 
which are causing so much toxicity sc and it sounds like this is great because not just an aspiration 
just a sort of feel good motto that if we found the cancer earlier we could help cure it 
more effectively but that there are very concrete steps being taken how popular is this view in the community 
this a plucky minority or is it catching on as this is what we should be concentrating on ar 
of these things i described to you are in various stages of development so everyone has known for fifty 
that the best strategy is to go early and people have spent a lot of time in screening and 
to make those as accurate as possible in the last years people have started developing all this new technology 
on the evolving genomic information and proteomics etcetera becoming available so clearly those things are all in various stages 
development not a pie in the sky but the more resources we need the more people will get interested 
young minds who are today wasting their time and talent and intellect on failing models because they are working 
mentors who for thirty years have used those failing models and the ones sitting in every granting agency deciding 
gets the grant and who gets to scratch back this all has to stop and young minds and young 
as well as resources should be better used i think ar and new technology new ideas new therapies will 
their own set of problems so not someone going to say all our problems will be because an old 
been there done that in all kinds of things but i do think that it is time to recognize 
least where we are failing time to take off our blinders time to at least describe the problem in 
detail and see the problem for what it is right now we are not even willing to see the 
not that we are just not finding the solution we refuse to look at the details of what we 
doing wrong my insistence is to look at all of this through the prism of human anguish because this 
not just some cutanddried science this involves humans this involves the andrew or a umar or my patient jc 
died at or harvey who was diagnosed with his first cancer and then at thirtyfour and his second cancer 
ar and this is one thing i want to also recount to you sean that my life has been 
to early detection since do you know why because i started by studying acute myeloid leukemia and treating patients 
it within a short space of seven years it became clear to me that in my lifetime this disease 
so aggressive we will not be able to cure it and i was right unfortunately we were using then 
are using now in because of a patient jc i realized that the best way to handle acute myeloid 
is to stop the disease before it becomes so aggressive are there patients like that yes a whole series 
syndromes called myelodysplastic syndromes which are preleukemic because a third of these patients can develop acute myeloid leukemia my 
was well then we should study preleukemia and follow these patients through and had i gone to school in 
country at this point i would have invested the rest of my life into making a mouse model of 
preleukemia chuckle ar but coming from pakistan as a fresh immigrant i trusted my instinct rather than followed custom 
i decided going to study these patients let me save their so i just started banking blood bone marrow 
biopsies normal buccal smears germ line controls on all my patients sc so by saving them you mean saving 
data you mean literally saving the tissues the cells ar both no i mean both the data as well 
the actual samples the most well annotated tissue repository which today has more than samples from thousands of patients 
not one cell has come from a different doctor every patient is my patient sc do you want other 
to contribute to this is there an ar very expensive they afford to do it sc oh okay so 
choice ar the only one who does it because i pay for it and how do i pay for 
no grant can support it my patients support it for me i asked them and they want to give 
money and i say i want personal money give it to the tissue because it costs almost a million 
a year just to maintain the tissue repository so point is that i have these samples which were obtained 
a longitudinal fashion serially on these thousands of patients as they progress from preleukemia to acute leukemia now if 
go in and study these samples and work our way back we can at the end go and ask 
question why did this a healthy individual even get preleukemia was there a genetic mutation that made them susceptible 
at high risk for it ar what was it about their exposome environment exposure what was there about their 
their inherited dna and so those kinds of questions we can then take to the dna sequences that are 
the public domain from hundreds of thousands of healthy volunteers and find out how many people fit our bill 
being at high risk of developing even preleukemia and then following those healthy individuals to find whether they develop 
or not and how quickly can we stop it there this is the kind of thing we need to 
the problem is so it took me so long to amass the samples even today doing five to ten 
marrows every week in my clinic with my own hands i do the bone marrows and banking them so 
have all this tissue the technology has got up we need resources going to give the resources the government 
it because i need one hundred dollars million to study the whole repository it as if i been studying 
sean sc of course ar over the last thirty years i have over three hundred original publications which are 
on the results we find from limited samples we take out study it for one gene or that signaling 
or this drug or that kind of thing with limited questions clearly now that all the technology has arrived 
we need to go in and study the entire tissue repository that is a thing that no one no 
grant can support one hundred dollars million to one individual and i need the money to set up a 
with seventy scientists working in it no this is money needed to pay for the actual tests for the 
to do the proteomics on two hundred patients it costs four dollars million this is the kind where the 
will go so the other idea that occurred to me sc if there are any mindscape listeners out there 
would like to donate one hundred dollars million chuckle sc the tissue repository encourage them to do that can 
just like to try to give the audience a sort of visceral feel for what like to be doing 
kind of work number one let me just mention this kind of longitudinal study is the gold standard in 
social sciences especially and really hard and expensive to do because you have to start young and continue to 
dedicated and get the resources but where is it where are these tissues are they in a room somewhere 
they kept cold or do they still duplicate the cells or is there a finite number of cells that 
use up ar so the entire tissue repository is housed at columbia university the cancer center it moved with 
from buffalo to cincinnati to chicago to massachusetts to new york now sc been around ar and it has 
travelled with me and these are samples which are in freezers but in addition we have frozen viable tissue 
which can be brought out and regrown in plates in animals in vitro in vivo so an immense collection 
samples everything belongs to columbia university i have any companies to my name i need any personal money this 
all going to go through columbia university so one thing that occurred to me sean is that the people 
should be most interested in finding the first cell are the people who are at highest risk of getting 
who are those people they are people like harvey my late husband people who have one cancer now i 
to scare your listeners at all but i do want to say that one in five new cancers is 
in a cancer survivor because whatever was there to cause the first cancer is still there sc the conditions 
still there ar conditions are there and probably with our treatment for some of them made the conditions worse 
harvey did not die of his cancer he died because we wiped out his immune system with the horrible 
we gave him so the point is the people at highest risk should be the most interested today in 
country there are twenty million survivors from cancer even if one million of them just give ten dollars a 
for a year it that will fund the whole tissue repository ar people ask me raza why should we 
you money and not to the american cancer my answer is the tissue for american cancer society talk is 
sean but the one who has the tissue the one who has the commitment to early detection because been 
after not just acute leukemia but preleukemia since i have been saying the same thing since how much more 
can i give people are very quick to start criticizing me talking about the first cell she know how 
screening measures have i know nobody needs to lecture me about these things because not only do i see 
patients every week i have had a cutting edge research lab for years and a cancer widow ar so 
have stood on both sides of the bed of a cancer patient as well as a family member as 
as an oncologist so there is really very little that i have not experienced directly and firsthand and i 
been consistently committed to finding cancer at its earliest possible cell and try to take care of it to 
the disease from happening and if people trust me by now and want to support this tissue repository then 
know who will all i can say is as long as there is one breath left in my body 
will keep saying the same thing and trying to work as hard as ever for my patients sc i 
of a better place to end up than that that was very eloquently said dr azra raza thanks so 
for being on the mindscape podcast ar thank you sean it has been an honor being on your podcast 
ar give one example my daughter best friend andrew three years ago at twentytwo years of age got diagnosed 
he had pain and tingling in an arm by the time he reached the emergency room he was already 
the neurosurgeons when they operated on him found a brain tumor which they could only partly remove so every 
knew from day zero that this poor chances of survival are do you know the first thing he said 
he woke up sean from the anesthesia he said was worry just call azra on the cutting edge gonna 
a cure for sc oh listening to that felt like a freight train hitting me right in the chest 
was a fantastic episode sean and i really enjoyed this i normally listen for the discussions on cosmology physics 
the future of our universe but this episode really brought the future of each individual to my mind and 
a fantastic departure from the usual fare thanks so much thank you for the insightful and brilliant episode it 
humbling to hear dr raza i was diagnosed with widely metastatic melanoma in december two thousand eighteen and treated 
checkpoint inhibitors after a few relatively easy infusions the cancer was undetectable and remission appears to be holding one 
later my experience is shared by many other patients who are being saved with immunotherapy dr raza should be 
for her passion and expertise in fighting cancer but she undersells the power of treating the immune system versus 
cancerous cells before they metastasize pursuing even earlier detection carries risks of unnecessary and costly treatments and patient anxiety 
you detect a few cancerous cells then what will the immune system take care of it will treatment be 
will we slash poison or burn the cells into submission this approach has failed patients for decades seems like 
more intelligent approach is to understand why and how the immune system fails to resolve the cancer on its 
and to enhance or strengthen it to do just that the immune system is an intelligent learning system as 
as the cancer but more powerful when functioning properly more research should be directed in this area leave the 
alone there are way too many types causes variables but fix the environment in which it thrives and support 
cells that are by design meant to patrol and defend us very moving episode is it possible to share 
where we can make small contribute to dr azra raza research pingback lucky day efrens blog comments are closed
