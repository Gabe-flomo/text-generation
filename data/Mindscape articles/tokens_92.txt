transcript sean carroll hello everybody and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and on this podcast 
talk about scientific advances what we learn about the universe but sometimes we also talk about philosophical questions of 
and wrong the morality and the ethics of how we should lead our lives and these domains of science 
ethics bump into each other not separate sometimes we are forced or nudged toward asking ethical questions about scientific 
technological advances learned something about the universe developed the ability to do something with our scientific knowledge but should 
do that thing should it be legal to do that thing and these are not just dorm room philosophy 
either the government often has to make decisions about what should and should not be legal when science introduces 
possibilities into our lives so today we welcome an honest to goodness law professor onto the podcast for the 
time and be talking about a wide range of questions dealing with these bioethical and legal issues alta charo 
a professor of law and bioethics at the university of wisconsin and madison and been active on both the 
and policy sides of the equation sc she served as a bioethics adviser on the obama administration transition team 
obama became president and also worked as a senior policy advisor at the food and drug administration when not 
that kind of policy role a professor writing articles in various journals and written extensively on things like stem 
research gene editing abortion religious exemptions to providing medical care should you be able to not provide a certain 
service if your religious belief says not right cloning organ donation and many many more an extremely broad thinker 
these issues and gonna talk about them gonna go through a whole list of interesting issues at the intersection 
biology ethics and the government the legal side of things and gonna also discuss what kind of comprehensive philosophical 
might allow us to address these questions in a systematic way so go music sc alta charo welcome to 
mindscape podcast alta charo pleased to be here sc now your official self designation is as a bioethicist is 
accurate ac yes and no i am a professor of law and i work in the field of bioethics 
sure anybody knows how to define a bioethicist sc that was one of my main questions that i was 
ask so a lawyer or a law professor ac yes sc but bioethics is the field of law that 
specialize in ac right sc and how would you try to define bioethics ac starting with one of the 
questions instead of one of the easiest ac so really its origins in recent history lie in the and 
two converging areas of interest one had to do with population growth and environmental conservation and in fact the 
bioethics was actually coined in the context of sustainable population growth you may remember from the the zero population 
movement and the concerns of malthusian future of overpopulation inevitably destroying the planet and so the phrase was actually 
to discuss those dilemmas about obligations to the future and at the same time in the we were seeing 
advances in clinical medicine and we were beginning to see theologians particularly talking a lot about what should or 
not be part of the medical tool kit particularly things like genetic screening which had implications for how much 
we take over our personal reproduction sc so genetics meaning in the sense of checking dna as a baby 
even as parents ac carrier screening through family pedigrees then in the amniocentesis where you would test the amniotic 
and look for chromosomal defects and these things created a situation where people had to make choices about whether 
have children or whether to keep that particular pregnancy whereas in previous generations this was up to luck fate 
however you understood these things and so you saw these two things begin to converge about this notion of 
ethical obligations that we should accept on behalf of others and also for what is considered to be a 
life and by the late we began to see the theologians the secular philosophers the physicians and later the 
we push ourselves in everywhere beginning to have conferences and develop sets of principles over things like how we 
govern research with human beings and how much respect individuals are entitled to and really where the field kind 
begins so i would say to define a bioethicist is to define somebody who is trying to grapple with 
questions but today they might be sociologists or anthropologists it could be empiricists who are looking at the patterns 
behavior or it could be theorists who are looking for a theory about why you should or should not 
a particular thing sc i mean obvious that what we can do today biologically and in terms of reproduction 
so forth there are scary new prospects interesting promising new prospects out there so the questions are changing very 
but i still guess a little bit surprised that the field of bioethics was not a thing before the 
mean we had some issues especially on the legal side forever so was it called something else or were 
no specialists in that ac i think that the patterns before were different and i think because with the 
perhaps of understanding the role of bacteria in disease and the development of antibiotics medicine in particular was fairly 
if you look back at what medicine consisted of a lot of it was really public health brought down 
the individual level eat right etc so even these older theories about the different humors in the body the 
the dry the hot the cold if you looked at it really closely often it wound up being a 
sc right wash your hands ac but some it of was bad cutting people open and draining their blood 
sc or cocaine yeah ac right and the lead in the makeup there were some very big mistakes but 
many ways medicine was fairly impotent and then suddenly with the advent particularly of antibiotics it became powerful and 
is the point because with each successive decade in the century we have gained more power over our own 
bodies over our physical fate and over therefore the fate of our offspring both knowledge and technology and technical 
has advanced incredibly fast now if ever gone to try and pick a cell phone sc right i have 
i think most people have had the same experience which is so confused by the range of choices each 
with a different set of pros and cons so i even match them across some kind of excel spreadsheet 
i wind up not doing anything and i stick with whatever got good right with power comes choice and 
are difficult figuring out first which choice to make and why or should you even have the choice and 
get to the point where you almost are sorry you have the choice and the reason why the power 
our bodies and over our futures created this kind of crisis that led to an enormous global conversation around 
we now call bioethics every one of these new powers demanded us to ask we even have the power 
choose and if we are going to choose which one should we these are questions never had to ask 
sc and very obvious that the government would want to jump in and the lawyers with them right is 
government very reflective about these things is there an ongoing debate about whether the government should even be involved 
what we might call typical bioethical questions ac this is really a matter of almost political philosophy rather than 
philosophy which is what most people think about in the area of bioethics and so you get to very 
answers very quickly because different countries are based on different political philosophies so there was something back in the 
i believe it was from newsweek i have tried to find it again i that really captured the different 
of political philosophies around the world and it went in the united states everything is allowed until prohibited fair 
sc fair yes ac in east germany everything is prohibited until allowed and that was a very stark way 
having a contrast of course they continued by saying in russia everything is prohibited especially if allowed laughter and 
italy everything is allowed especially if prohibited right and there was some truth to those too it did capture 
a weird way very well these very distinct political cultures that drives government action more than the actual question 
human cloning which became an issue in one thousand nine hundred ninetyeight with dolly the cloned sheep there was 
tremendous interest in the media there was the unfortunate revelation of how poor our education system is with regard 
biology because people continued to imagine that cloning meant xeroxing yourself and having an adult identical to you sc 
know do everything i need to do right ac right and there was the misunderstanding that you could clone 
as opposed to body type so asked whom they would not want to clone say saddam hussein who was 
dictator of choice at the time and whom would you wanna clone and they would say mother teresa as 
you were gonna get a selfless nun as opposed to somebody who was prone to scoliosis in her old 
so with cloning you might think that there would be a common analysis that would lead to the same 
about whether it should be permitted or not by the government is it the role of the government to 
the choice and what choice should it make in fact not at all what happened in fact what happened 
that with regard to cloning we saw again the same reflection of governmental approaches so in many european countries 
there is much more of a comprehensive governmental regulation and where the existence of a public health care scheme 
that you can regulate simply by saying will or will not offer certain you had a government that could 
intervene and say is not sc they almost had no choice right i mean the government did everything so 
gonna be done the gonna be involved ac yeah if democracies but the government had that power whereas in 
united states instead of having a general prohibition we had a general absence of law there were a handful 
states that passed statutes to criminalize cloning often overbroad they criminalized even basic lab research at the same time 
used to give a talk called stem cells to jail about the scientists in these states but at the 
level the congress talked about it there was some murmurings nothing ever happened and partly because we have the 
avenue in to regulate so number one we do it through just spending decisions and second we have a 
that lays out individual rights against government action in particular the government may not abridge my right to free 
or to assembly and we also have this notion of a right to big certain kinds of procreative decisions 
of government at least free of government prohibitions not free of government regulation and that creates a counterway to 
action that exist in many of these european countries so we wound up with different policies that reflect our 
about cloning everybody might have thought a terrible idea or a good idea it matter what it reflected was 
power of the government sc and already into not only political philosophy but constitutional law in the sense that 
in the constitution does it talk about reproductive rights or rights to have sex in certain ways and so 
but the idea that this implied set of rights given by the bill of rights not necessarily that it 
everything that we have but it gives you the impression that the government should keep its hands off of 
things and this becomes contentious once you actually get into the courts ac one fairly noncontentious area of constitutionally 
rights is the right to marry now talking just about heterosexuals right sc yeah ac but nowhere in the 
that says you have a right to marry and yet it became the basis for striking down the laws 
virginia that criminalized marriage between people who are deemed white and people who are deemed black this is the 
of loving v virginia one of the best named cases ever sc a great one yes ac great name 
so it was the right to marry that was evoked ac the right to marry and now where did 
court get it because the courts over the years have come to recognize that at the time the constitution 
written there were two things that were in line number one something seemed so obvious you have to say 
like gettting married sc yeah should be able to get married ac everybody gets married sc and it goes 
with this philosophy that in the united states if not a specific rule against it then allowed to do 
ac but to have something as a constitutionally protected right is a little different than that because it means 
protected more rigorously this is a digression but get back to the con law most of our liberties are 
liberties my freedom to drive is an ordinary liberty and the government can regulate that or even prohibit many 
these things so long as they have a rational basis for it but when you have something that is 
guaranteed in the constitution whether in the bill of rights or in one of these pronouncements from the court 
a fundamental right then the government stop you from doing it unless it can show first of all a 
need not just a rational basis a compelling need that cannot be answered by anything that is less onerous 
that is a very very strict standard that is applied so with the right to marry it raised it 
being a state that says we have a rational basis that intermarriage is disruptive to the social order and 
puts the kids at a might have passed muster but if a fundamental right then now the state has 
show that a compelling need to stop these people from marrying and that a disruption to society that be 
any other way and they meet that kind of balance ac now that right to marry is nowhere in 
constitution partly at the origins nobody thought you had to say it the second part of it is if 
look at in the original bill of rights these are things that the english actually were trying to stop 
assembly and speech or things that they were doing like quartering soldiers in our home so of course this 
what was on their minds and the right to have sex on their minds right sc they never contemplated 
that would need to be regulated in anyway ac actually it was heavily regulated but by the churches and 
was regulated at the state level not at the federal level each state tended to have a different religious 
but the point simply is that over the years the courts have recognized that the constitution is not a 
document a starting point and they have tried to fill in the gaps over time and one of those 
was the right to privacy where privacy is a variety of things that are not just about being able 
keep information to yourself but also about being able to have a sphere of action that is free from 
intrusion and a sphere of personal relationships that is free of government intrusion and on that basis we got 
like the decision that connecticut is not allowed to criminalize the sale and use of contraceptives for married couples 
marital relationship is an intimate one that should be beyond the intrusion ac and then it moved beyond that 
a right to privacy about the control of your own body when single women were now protected by a 
right to have access to contraception so the government criminalize it for single women no longer about marital intimacy 
about controlling your body and we really do see that playing out through the roe v wade decision about 
my body during pregnancy and now we see the extension of those things in other areas like the right 
marry being extended beyond the heterosexual couple sc and i think this is just a crucial point in terms 
understanding how the legal system works here in the united states that the courts do have this idea that 
really are rights that can be used to strike down legislation even though these rights were not explicitly written 
the bill of rights or the constitution that there is this feeling that we should err on the side 
letting people do things even if those are not delineated item by item ac i think now become a 
of contention interestingly enough because there grew up starting with the federalist society a couple of decades ago this 
of movement within legal thinking that the notion of a living constitution in which courts over time are constantly 
to fill in these gaps is one that have any limits that you have no control over what the 
will do and therefore we need to put the brakes on the courts and the way do it say 
allowed to use things that were actually written down in sc right so originalism roughly speaking ac right now 
have to say that many of these people who call themselves originalist including justice antonin scalia one of the 
famous ones failed completely to be originalist when it led to an outcome they like so it was a 
of inconsistent application but nonetheless that was the kind of clarion call sc well and it sounds reasonable when 
put it that way we need to protect against the expansion being completely unchecked of the powers of the 
to do whatever they want ac and the powers of the congress so in the when the debate was 
a related set of concerns called substantive due process again not about whether the procedure use is fair but 
whether this is an area the government should be mixed into it all we had the congress passing laws 
for example worker wages and health protections which were struck down by the courts as being beyond the purview 
the government and so this led to a crisis again about how do we reign in the courts from 
this case undermining congressional enactment so from different eras you get this kind of seesawing because it is a 
with a kind of tripod of key institutions that are all checking one another so natural that they go 
a wobble sc right and you mentioned the right to privacy and how this gets implemented and obviously one 
area of clashing is between individual consciences especially as they reflect religious beliefs versus the demands of the state 
do one thing or another many different areas in which these clashes happen do you have a general theory 
how we should adjudicate it when the personal religious beliefs of a citizen ask that citizen or demand that 
citizen do something that the government is not happy with ac i do but not uncontested there are people 
disagree completely sc i expect that ac i think two levels on which you address this one is the 
abstract level of what is the role of religion in the public life and the shared public life of 
in the united states about whether or not i should see the public square metaphorically speaking as one where 
expresses their religious views even if it adversely affects somebody else religious view says that black people and white 
marry and so i want to give an interracial couple housing in my sc so the word their religious 
lot of kinds of expression not just talking ac right or wearing a symbol because the argument there would 
living my beliefs by rejecting them for housing if i let them live in my apartment building essentially blessing 
union or even tolerating their union is considered to be a violation of my that one view is that 
cacophony of voices in the public square operates to the benefit of us all we all get to do 
we want even if it hurts somebody else and we all have to figure out how to protect ourselves 
somebody else the completely conflicting view is that the public square should be one that is absolutely a vacuum 
it comes to religion and you wanna express your religion fine go do it in your own living room 
do it in your own church mosque synagogue temple whatever but when you come into the public square you 
abide by a set of rules that are gonna be the same for everybody and allowed to feel like 
are somehow an oddity or a minority or anything like that so one set of competing theories and i 
to deal with this a fundamental problem ac more narrowly in bioethics we have seen it really come to 
fore when it comes to medical professionals and certain medical procedures in particular contraception and abortion to a somewhat 
extent some of the issues around how it is that we help people die peacefully sc okay yeah an 
one ac and here i think that we be looking at it as a contest between religious expression and 
equality i think the right way to look at i think we need to ask about power dynamics and 
it means to be a professional because as a physician or as a pharmacist you basically are taking an 
to serve your patient and you have more power than the patient in fact for doctors and pharmacists a 
power not a physician not allowed to prescribe contraception or perform an abortion only a physician can do it 
because a closed community the community has an obligation to make all legal services available otherwise we would have 
public utilities the electric company could say not gonna provide electricity to planned parenthood or to the kkk and 
want that they just give out electricity so i would say we need to look at power dynamics in 
area of conscience i would find it more defensible if somebody a checkout clerk at a supermarket said am 
devoted vegetarian and vegan i believe in the use of animals for food so simply not gonna ring up 
animal sc and i wanna be fired from my job ac and they wanna be fired the point with 
physicians too they wanna be fired they wanna be denied promotion they want to be vulnerable to malpractice suits 
here the clerk wanna be fired and i actually think more defensible because much easier for somebody to go 
the other line or for the company to make sure that actually hired a lot of people most of 
will do animal products and really not the same kind of power differential that there is between a doctor 
a patient sc so you think that a social interest in these cases where we as a society have 
so much power to certain groups of people part of the contract is then you have to do the 
that society wants you to ac exactly right and if you really wanna take on those obligations you should 
for a different kind of vocation where you find yourself in this kind of a conflict in other words 
your religious restrictions that create moral crises for you be your problem or should they be everybody problem sc 
we do want on the other hand to let people have freedom of expression in these sort of narrow 
of expression worship in whatever way they want it gets into not just professionals like doctors or pharmacists but 
parents raising children who wanna give certain kinds of medical care to their kids and you might think that 
should be obligated to do the appropriate procedures and yet also believe that parents be obligated to have those 
done to their kids ac so now touched on two more topics that are central to the way we 
things in bioethics touched on the notion of individual autonomy and capacity to give consent very closely linked in 
case describing of parents and medical care we would in bioethics probably find ourselves talking about the parents having 
right as autonomous competent individuals to make decisions about their own health care or lack thereof and that when 
children come of age their children would have the same privilege but that while the children are young and 
really not able to make the decisions for themselves now the question is do parents have unlimited discretion to 
decisions for their children or is there some point where we stop and we say know now the society 
makes the and of course we take children away from abusive parents and we argue that parents have a 
as autonomous beings to beat their children ac now with people who engage in things like faith healing no 
motive like there is with beating your child but the result can be the same which is that the 
is gravely injured or dies and that is the point at which the state steps in so most places 
some kind of statute that tries to lay out a borderline where the parental decisions are now putting the 
at high risk of having a permanent or serious injury or could lead to death at which point the 
takes over sc yeah i think this gets right i think that fuzzy sometimes we fool ourselves about the 
between morality and religion and law we tell ourselves you can have your personal religious beliefs but there is 
law that everyone obeys in the country and they should be able to get but of course we use 
personal notions of morality to guide what laws we think there should be like murder is bad that feeds 
passing a law that murdering is bad and that goes back to complete the cycle into the fundamental nature 
living in a pluralist society again we pretend that we can all get along even though our fundamental values 
be very very different and it seems necessary to me that the ability to obey your own personal fundamental 
can only go so far if you do live in a pluralistic society ac this absolutely right is one 
the great challenges of a country that talks about being a melting pot in fact i think more like 
stew a melting pot suggests that everybody winds up the same that is not what is happening as somebody 
grew up in new york in an intensely ethnic borough with a little bit of this and a little 
of that i can tell you that it was a stew the italians the irish the eastern european jews 
south asian indians every one of those households had a distinctly different culture and yet when we all played 
in the street there was a kind of common soup that all these little chunks of culture were sitting 
and flavored all of them honest to goodness i grew up not being completely sure whether lasagna was a 
food or not laughter and because of the world that i lived in so if gonna live in a 
you have to acknowledge there are gonna be these differences ac so how do you decide gonna be the 
soup the common flavoring that tinges everything there are philosophers like john rawls with whom i understand you had 
chance to study who worked really hard to try and articulate some methodology by which we could arrive at 
for law or governing or common morality and a key thing that he talked about was the idea of 
publicly accessible reasoning that is you may conclude that murder is wrong because you are a devotee of the 
commandments and the ten commandments say shalt not i may come from a totally different culture i look to 
ten commandments but i have a culture that lives by a golden rule i wanna be murdered therefore wrong 
me to murder therefore i conclude murder is wrong and we now converge on a common moral rule and 
a legal rule that murder is wrong because we can get there through some common sets of reasoning now 
where coming from is one where no way for you to explain it except by reference to your particular 
no nonfaithbased argument at all that could work for somebody who share your faith then we have a problem 
that would not comfortably fit in our laws it really is a rule that only makes sense to a 
of the population sc well interesting i think that where you ended up was slightly different to where i 
you were going i thought what you were gonna say was that it matter what your justification is if 
practical implementation of that justification agrees from lots of different people ac fair enough and i did i kind 
slid there and i think that both of those are true actually if we can both come up with 
same solution from different premises that works if you can step back from your say religious premise that this 
ordained by a deity and yet you can explain to me who share your view about that deity why 
is nonetheless a bad thing and persuade me then that would be the publicly accessible reasoning the reasoning that 
people could somehow get on board with without having to accept where coming from in terms of your religious 
and both of those things would lead to laws that are going to be manageable across the population sc 
that sounds great to me personally now there will always be exceptions we can imagine families where in their 
they have this religion thing figured out they know what god says and god says certain specific things and 
fact that a child might not get a certain medicine and therefore will die is ultimately a good thing 
the child will go to heaven as opposed to if we give them medicine then they would not go 
heaven and that sounds like an irreconcilable difference with the public demands ac i think there are those moments 
do think there are those moments yes sc and we just have to force them to suck it up 
ac i think we accommodate them so long as it is an autonomous rational competent adult making the decision 
him or herself where we change the rules is not on where your irreconcilable difference affects you and you 
where it affects somebody else who in no way is in a position to have welcomed this kind of 
for themselves and why we make the distinction sc so the flip side of that at the end of 
would lead you to say that people should be able to decide what their end of life is very 
right now in i talked about this on other podcasts undergoing this transition when becoming more common to have 
with dignity laws or something like that where people need to go through all the possible medical procedures to 
themselves alive or even can essentially commit suicide can essentially end their own lives and this is not something 
i think a lot of people are yet happy with but it would go in the direction of that 
the person the grownup autonomy over their own decision ac and indeed if you look at going back to 
supreme court you look at the supreme court decisions you see that the decisions around things like contraception and 
included language about liberty that would comfortably encompass the right of the individual to be free of a state 
that criminalizes the effort to take a drug going to allow you to die comfortably instead of having to 
yourself to death or forego comforting medical procedures now we have buried in our common law which is not 
the kind of ordinary daily law that we have going all the way back to england and is handled 
things like civil litigation like torts with pay we have there this notion of bodily autonomy why if i 
you in a way that is harmful or offensive without your permission a battery and i have to pay 
damages if you sue me and on that basis people have long been entitled since the if clear to 
medical treatments even medical treatments that are needed to keep them alive the death with dignity argument was about 
that also should include not just the right to reject a physical intrusion but to take upon yourself something 
will help you die more peacefully and sc something active ac something active and where the debate about liberty 
went and always found it intriguing that the court has not really faced it the way they could and 
should because if gonna talk about a liberty that encompasses your psychological and emotional state talking about things like 
for men their bodies are not implicated not the ones gonna get pregnant so if you think a right 
men to be able to obtain contraception without the state throwing them in jail saying that men have a 
to control their futures in this very important way that would suggest the same thing would be true at 
end of life but if i may all of these things go back to the earlier point about power 
whether modes of conception with gamete donation and surrogate mothers and ivf or death with dignity and use of 
part of the argument simply has been whether human beings ought to have any control over these very fundamental 
in the human existence or whether that ought to be somehow beyond our control and in the hands of 
fill in how you think of it your deity faith nature something else sc right so it sounds like 
distinction that trying to emphasize here is that we can allow for autonomy of persons for their own wellbeing 
as soon as they are put in a position of power over others they have to obey the rules 
and notice by the way that in the public health world we are constantly running up against the libertarian 
to public health law so if about me having to not pollute the water that you drink we understand 
but if about why i drink raw milk which has a objectively higher risk of giving me a really 
condition which will have me vomiting and with diarrhea for days uh any laws that prohibit the sale of 
to me are viewed as nanny state because they are impinging on my autonomy so we see the same 
playing out over and over and over in the united states sc kind of on board with the idea 
if someone really wants to poison themselves by drinking raw milk they should be able to do that ac 
actually the way i said it is a little bit misleading because there is no law that says you 
raw milk the laws are about prohibiting the sale of it sc right but kind ac and a little 
about whether we can regulate the economy sc and exactly why in most states where there is some kind 
prohibition on the sale of raw milk also an exception for the own family for guests on the farm 
are people who then bought shares of a farm so that they could be considered the farmer as well 
order to be able to have access but it is about trying to make sure that you allow a 
to be made off of the distribution of a product that is manifestly high risk sc you must know 
this week in california there was a controversy about cancer warnings on coffee ac yes sc california loves putting 
on things and saying gonna kill you and i think that the breaking point was when it seemed as 
you would have to put a warning on coffee that you got at starbucks saying might give you and 
people said no no this is going too already very clear to anyone who lives in california that a 
in every establishment saying here are gonna give you and we ignore the sign it becomes useless it becomes 
ac well yeah so certainly the over warning problem and all the warnings then become a mush a second 
though and that is the failure to make a distinction between hazard and risk many substances are a hazard 
this week also the news glyphosate which is a weed killer used in roundup crops is present in cheerios 
so the headlines were all about how your children are being poisoned in their cheerios but in sc i 
cheerios are known to be unhealthy for other reasons ac but a hazard is something that has the capacity 
cause some kind of harm but the risk is the hazard and the probabilities and so you have to 
what is the exposure that is needed and in the case of coffee and frankly in the case of 
as well the exposure has to be i know what the number is many many many many many orders 
magnitude greater than anybody consumes in order to actually have this possible effect remember this is only probabilistic that 
might in some percentage of situations cause of cancer so this is part of the problem of the over 
if you only talk about the fact that something is capable of causing cancer most of the foods we 
would wind up being on that list because if consumed in sufficiently enormous amounts you could distort the human 
in ways that then in turn will cause some failure of your immune system or something that eventually leads 
cancer so california and many of the other groups that want warnings for anything that ever showed that it 
cause cancer and grossly overfed caged rats need to actually add in some mathematics sc exactly no speaking our 
here a whole theme of my various podcast episodes is calculating probabilities updating them being a good bayesian evaluating 
rationally in trying to make decisions and not very automatic the human brain work that way we see something 
could be cancerous in here therefore not eat and then it takes me back i wanted to pick up 
previous thread we talked about how religious beliefs could lead people to object to certain governmental mandates but a 
of that really coming down to just squeakiness a lot of what drives people to object to very cutting 
bio procedures whether cloning or stem cell research or whatever just the fact it seem natural to us it 
somehow icky and therefore err on the side of not to doing it am i oversimplifying people i disagree 
ac no in fact that is not everybody who opposes these things there are very distinct different approaches to 
objectors to many emerging technologies some are very careful to be talking about downstream consequences and their lack of 
in institutions or human nature to avoid the extreme unwanted application of these things for others it really is 
religious view about the role of humans visavis a deity and where we should stop having control period but 
another group for whom unfamiliar it seems to have a lot of power and heard that it might be 
in ways that are unpleasant so heard that your coffee may cause cancer so heard the hazard but they 
taken in the information about the risk factor and in general unfamiliar and unfamiliar often leads to what one 
prominent bioethicist coming from a fairly conservative end of the field called the wisdom of repugnance sc wow so 
were trying to elevate this visceral reaction into a principled approach ac into a principled approach that if people 
widespread shared repugnance of something telling us something deep even if we quite articulate it sc not crazy actually 
could put it that way ac no not crazy at all but it can also send us off in 
directions because it was the repugnance with intermarriage between people of different races that led to the antimiscegenation laws 
was the repugnance of people who are darker that led white people to enslave dark people there are many 
in which this repugnance has been really catastrophically damaging to say nothing of what it did for generations and 
of people who are homosexual in their orientation sc and transgender people now ac and transgender people now which 
a good example of something which is unfamiliar and i think right other people say it was icky my 
concern is i really want us to get a different pronoun i wanna use the word i really sc 
liked i use ac i at all my seventh grade english teacher is still within me laughter ac is 
plural it is not singular sc your seventh grade english teacher should read shakespeare and jane austen they use 
as a singular pronoun all the time ac yeah i know yeah but i forgive them because i love 
writing but right that there is this kind of ick factor actually i coined the phrase yuck factor same 
sc there you go yeah ac i think that that is one that is manageable because with familiarity people 
are in the yuck factor camp now begin to split into supporters or opponents with a more carefully thought 
basis for the opposition it might be religious it might be consequentialist i think that gonna lead to something 
but the kind of undifferentiated yuck is now being differentiated into reason to conversation sc right that makes perfect 
to sort not that we think yucky therefore probably but think yucky therefore think about it think why exactly 
we think yucky is it coming from some principled moral stance or is it just our reptilian brain has 
seen this before and is reacting ac exactly exactly sc and so things like test tube babies or artificial 
those were hot topics of debate a few years ago and now i think that that much debate left 
of on board with that right ac we are in fact in vitro fertilization which you referred to as 
tube babies and resist that just it continues to sc well i use the sensationalist thing on purpose ac 
continues to give this image of babies in test tubes in vitro fertilization has now become something that is 
familiar because so many people have used it that it actually began to impinge on the abortion debate originally 
was controversial not only it was unnatural but because for the very first time in human history the human 
was outside the human body and was subject to manipulation it raised again this power the power to discard 
power to manipulate the power to experiment on all kinds of things we never had to ask ourselves before 
we allowed to do that should we do that ac and those were influenced in large part also by 
abortion debates but now had state after state that has tried to pass called a personhood amendment for people 
oppose abortion rights there have been an effort to pass either a constitutional or legislative provision that says from 
first moment of fertilization this entity has the same legal status as a live born baby which would have 
number of implications for how the embryo has to be managed and protected and guarded and those personhood amendments 
failed every single time even in highly conservative states with a majority of the population opposed to most abortions 
because it would have the effect of basically criminalizing in vitro fertilization and there are just too many grandmothers 
be grandmothers if their daughters had a chance to use ivf sc get the grandmothers arguing against you not 
win but it also true that ova get fertilized all the time but get implanted ac sure sc and 
that now that every woman is a murderer right under ac well intent is an important concept both in 
and in law sc okay how they get out of that ac yes i think that that observation is 
important for those who pin everything on the moral status intrinsically due to its own biology of the fertilized 
or the early embryo to observe that in fact a vast majority of times an egg will be fertilized 
fertilized at the wrong time of the month and so the uterine wall is not ready to capture it 
it passes out of our body we even realize that we had a fertilized egg within us because an 
menses cycle and that even for those that take there are a regrettably high number of miscarriages whose causes 
the way are largely unknown because of the restrictions we placed on ourselves sc we do research icky ac 
of the restrictions on doing research among other things with human embryos at a more advanced stage so if 
whole point is that about the biology is what yields moral significance then the fact that most fertilized eggs 
this high risk of not ever becoming a developed fetus or baby seems relevant but i think that even 
we talk about abortion in terms of the sanctity of the fetus and the right to life of the 
that buried within it is actually an entirely different thing which is all about intent because the woman who 
the fertilized egg through no action of her own is innocent but the woman who makes the decision to 
exactly the same thing which is lose that fertilized egg is now evil sc jezebel ac because she intentionally 
this ongoing process which might or might not result in a human and that intent that i think is 
important here even people who oppose abortion rights generally often make exceptions for rape or incest because those are 
to be involuntary experiences for the woman or the girl in the case of incest so in those cases 
and therefore the abortion is okay even though the sanctity of the fetus ought to be exactly the same 
if you went all the way then it matter yeah ac and within the movement of people who oppose 
abortion rights there is a kind of split there is a fracture at that point between those for whom 
really is about the sanctity of the biological life where biology determines your philosophical status and those for whom 
really is not about the fetus they think it is but actually about their evaluation of this woman who 
ahead and had sex but want to accept the risk of pregnancy as a fill in the blank a 
a deterrent or as her natural fate as a woman in terms of the way they think about men 
women sc yeah i think that religious traditions often fall into this trap but even just people more generally 
to judge other people as being bad and pass laws not letting them do it very very human kind 
thing something we need to watch out for in this sphere ac there is a phrase that you hear 
around all the time ought to be a sc right i like it ac and really difficult in public 
even difficult in my classroom with law students to make people step back and say is it possible i 
this is wrong but i think that it should be the business of the government to determine whether you 
do it it should be social pressure it should be religious teachings it should be the advice of your 
regardless of sc and both liberals and conservatives sometimes are more willing than they should be to pass laws 
help their own personal preferences ac this is absolutely true absolutely right about it being so instinctive that if 
think something is just terribly wrong that we want some power to stop it and the government and laws 
the enforcement power of the government seem like a great way to do that certainly more direct but in 
there is a world of difference between the things that are right and wrong and the things that should 
legal and illegal we make laws about things that are not wrong actually fine but they have consequences that 
accept the knowledge that i have about a particular stock because on the board of directors might make it 
for me to buy and sell and make money now making money is not wrong and using information is 
what we celebrate except an unfair advantage and it undermines the integrity of the market and the confidence of 
noninsiders and so we say illegal called insider trading now the law does not necessarily correspond point by point 
morality and nor should it sc right so i had a podcast conversation a couple episodes ago with carl 
the science writer and we got into the crazy world of gene editing and crispr and the future of 
babies so sure i think pretty obvious that there are bioethical and legal concerns coming up here what are 
issues that you worry about the most in this frontier ac well first make some distinctions in the application 
they raise very different concerns for those that are unfamiliar with these things this is another form of genetic 
so a continuation of something been doing for a while but it is much more precise much more efficient 
interestingly can be done by people with less training and facilities that are less sophisticated so the way youtube 
movie making and really transformed a lot of things this decentralizes a key area of science in a very 
way sc the democratization of our knowledge about our own genes ac and the democratization of what we can 
with them instead of having to go to a trained physician who has a sophisticated lab once again talking 
power and this gives more power to more people to do more things with more power to predict whether 
will work okay so talk about two very distinct areas of application one is what call somatic and the 
is germline germline means eggs and sperm and embryos where if you make a change not only gonna affect 
person who comes from that embryo or those eggs and sperm but their own eggs and sperm will have 
affected so the grandchildren great grandchildren all the way down the line will also be affected until that particular 
mutates the way things do in nature sc and why is that called germline ac because the germ cells 
the gametes are the eggs and sperm sc okay i think of germs as causing diseases but i ac 
no but think about germination in the world of plants sc very good thank you that helps me connect 
truth there ac so one area of application the far more controversial one the less controversial one is what 
call somatic where you change cells any kind of cell except the egg sperm and embryo so if you 
some of the cells say in my liver i will feel the effects but my children will not okay 
affect my eggs that is what we call somatic editing and so the advantage there is it only affects 
person being treated so now we can restrict ourselves only gonna talk about people who are competent an adult 
if a child somebody for whom doing this for their own welfare like preventing or curing a disease sc 
most people are gonna be on board with that fairly straightforwardly ac most people will absolutely be on board 
that and in fact they already are because already doing gene therapy to try and deal with cancer and 
but we have been largely unsuccessful because just such an arduous process and this may be the ticket to 
it a less arduous process the one area of controversy that does develop even in somatic editing is in 
that cure or prevent a disease but alter an already existing trait that we would deem healthy and within 
normal range of human capacity so take somebody whose muscle strength is average and if you could edit so 
their muscles now became unusually strong that raises controversies because of the perception that somehow this creates an unfair 
of course we do that all the time through other mechanisms whether nutrition or training so it gets into 
entire debate about meritocracy and earning things versus having them given to you and fate because some people are 
born lucky to have stronger muscles so why are they more deserving than somebody who uses editing to get 
the same point sc or someone born wealthier who can afford a jet to get where they wanna go 
so that is the socalled enhancement debate and in many ways more about this concern about society and equity 
it is about the actual phenomenon of the transformation up to the point where talking about a transformation that 
you beyond known human capacities a transformation that gave you something profoundly different allowed you to see into the 
or the ultraviolet which normal human beings do that raises different questions about whether or not we want the 
to actually fundamentally alter the parameters of what we call homo sapien sc so do we ac a very 
conversation let me at least address germline first sc okay ac the conversation around germline circles back again and 
to this issue of human reproduction because it is raising fears about designer babies this again is biologically untenable 
hard to control traits there are very very few things that are going to be controlled by a single 
things are multigenic sc by a single gene you mean yeah ac yeah multigenic so many genes and the 
are operating against a particular context and background and furthermore we are hardly ever discussing something called epigenetics which 
what affects how strongly the genes operate like you and i could play the same keys on the piano 
using the pedals differently it sounds very different the epigenetics is the pedals and now beginning to learn more 
more about the effect of the microbiome this incredible number of critters that live inside of us that also 
how our genes express so biologically we design our kids we really sc but we as philosophers and bioethicists 
ask the question it seems like a technology question whether or not we can or we and kind of 
i really know but maybe wrong maybe we can maybe fifty years from now we figured out how to 
everyone look like brad pitt and angelina jolie and is it bad if people want to do that is 
a principle or is that just a yuck based stance ac well hard to answer something that seems so 
impossible with an answer that is sober and so i will tell you first that rather look like beyonce 
sc outdated in my references yes ac you really are that said we make choices all the time to 
to influence the probabilities there is something called assortative mating we tend to marry or otherwise have children with 
from a limited range and so that changes the probabilities that our children are going to be tall or 
fat or skinny brown haired or blonde because of this assortative mating and it happens for all kinds of 
i mean even within a religious group in my neighborhood which was mostly as i said this mix of 
but in my little part of the neighborhood that was eastern european jewish the men were short they were 
short my father was five foot three laughter and if i married within my group my kids were gonna 
short and so in a sense designing overlapping conversation ac or i could choose to deliberately try to find 
guy tall i wanted my children to be taller we do this all the time so part of it 
my resistance to the idea something fundamentally alien about trying to change the probabilities of the outcomes with genetics 
about probabilities anyway part of my concern here is that i do think that there are many people whose 
are just very much consequentialist that is we think that likely to make a mistake and the gonna be 
by it a risk assessment problem that we face all the time and i completely am on board with 
we be doing this until we have an incredibly high degree of confidence that the outcome is gonna be 
the benefit of the child and any subsequent descendants which is why germline editing to prevent a devastating often 
disease seems to me to be a far easier case to make it expands the capacities in a way 
guarantees the open future that philosophers like joel feinberg have talked about is a kind of moral obligation ac 
a disease that a closer call but i still think very easy to justify and every time we take 
vaccine we are enhancing ourselves because enhancing our resistance to disease so this is a form of enhancement i 
makes sense again with attention to whether or not there is an unexpected consequence by protecting us against this 
do we suddenly make ourselves vulnerable to a different one now a very tricky problem with multigenerational effects you 
need to have a multigenerational experiment to see how it plays out and that alone may make it impossible 
satisfy these conditions for making it an ethically defensible thing to do others i think though have an objection 
i think goes more deeply to the notion that we tinker with the human species and here i get 
that people have an outdated notion of what it means to say something is a species sc okay ac 
think that there is unfortunately in high school education still this way of teaching biology and evolutionary theory as 
all vertical genes are only transmitted vertically and that they go from the past to the future through the 
to the child to the child and that the species is a closed universe of genetic traits when in 
evolution is not a tree with branches and twigs ever separating further out this chaotic mishmash of things that 
constantly crossing back and forth we have genes within us that come from wildly different species that incorporated into 
very cells so a horizontal movement of genes that blurs the notion of species line and so i think 
there is an overly romanticized notion of what it means to be a homo sapien that leads people to 
get concerned that we are somehow undermining the integrity of the concept of homo sapien i think you can 
i think that concept is as pure as people imagine sc yeah i think that philosophically exactly right that 
should know better by now than to treat things like species or even individuals as out there in the 
inviolable categories that we break down there are things that are invented there are concepts that are constructed by 
beings to help us understand the world a little bit better and as technology evolves then naturally gonna hit 
boundaries of where those ideas become useful i personally think and i said this to carl also i personally 
that fretting about where gene editing is gonna go in terms of human enhancement is kind of a waste 
time i think gonna happen i think i know how well it will happen i know how effective it 
be because like you say a huge amount of nonlinearity and things we understand but i think that people 
gonna try i think that people are gonna try to have babies that are ten feet tall so they 
be basketball players ac maybe so but i think that far more likely people are gonna try to enhance 
in ways because much more direct if what you want is to be ten feet tall then actually take 
liveborn child and inject that child with something to try to make the child got taller which parents do 
the way now when they give their kids human growth hormone even though the kids are not human growth 
deficient the kids are simply at the far lower end of the growth curve and the parents recognized that 
particularly for boys because of the nature of our society that can be very disadvantageous in the marriage market 
in the employment market so much more efficient if you wanna make your kid have a different capacity do 
when the been born doing it at the embryonic stage is like taking a pellet gun and shooting it 
into a park land hoping that something lands in the right place and that it have all these untoward 
because of other places it had an effect once the kid is born or once you do it to 
when an adult you can be far more targeted and far more confident get what you want sc okay 
to keep in mind as we go forward what we always think about starting with human beings and making 
better making them smarter and faster and stronger so what about starting with animals and making them smarter do 
need as bioethicists to worry about who counts as a human being what if we take a chimpanzee and 
him really smart or a dolphin or an octopus ac you even have to change any of their current 
to face that problem in fact in law something called habeas corpus motion a motion to the court to 
those who have somebody in custody to show why entitled to have somebody in custody and that habeas corpus 
has now been brought in several different courts on behalf of chimpanzees that have been owned and kept in 
by zoos by circuses and other kinds of displayers and so far they have lost in the courts but 
argument that making is that even without any change chimpanzees have an intellectual and emotional life that is complex 
that capable of suffering and that once capable of suffering you have a right not to be forced to 
they may not have a right to go to college because they actually benefit from it sc or to 
ac right or to vote or in other words an idea that rights are corresponding to those things where 
rights could actually be experienced and give value why in fact we already acknowledged this i am not allowed 
the law by the way to torture my cat because she can suffer sc because she can suffer ac 
am however allowed to bring her to the veterinarian even when she is young and have her put down 
to speak which is killed why because of our belief that the cat can experience suffering but has a 
limited understanding of future and so not necessarily a right to continue your own existence but there is a 
not to be miserable in it and so you even have to enhance in order to get to this 
about whether or not animals should be treated differently sc do chimpanzees have a notion of the future ac 
i think a little unclear i am i think the only law professor in america ever been on a 
of chimpanzee research stations and has been sprayed head to toe with chimpanzee urine sc alright put that on 
cv yes ac this is a unique experience for a law professor yes but it was in the context 
the nih the national institute of health deciding what they wanted to do about the use of chimpanzees in 
experiments whether it should continue with nih funding and what kind of conditions should they be held in if 
were going to be used and the family units are very real the emotional context is very real but 
inability to communicate makes it terribly difficult to assess notions of their consciousness and their notion of futurity and 
leave it to the psychologists come up with some very clever experiments to test whether animals have a sense 
self for example to try and help us figure that out now could we edit animals to make them 
useful to us regardless of whether it makes them more human sure the same way we breed animals all 
time animals to be more useful to us sc kind of doing that ac and bred all kinds of 
animals to be more useful and bred pets to be prettier even though in fact some of those breeding 
have led to high degree of genetic misfortune just say sc and terrible yeah ac like the hip dysplasia 
you see in some breeds of dogs which is a direct consequence of the inbreeding done to make the 
look a certain way so again the question with editing is we can do it that way why we 
it this the why not or terrible that doing that maybe we should forbid this as a starting point 
forbid the other ways already doing those are two good arguments to be having and a lot of it 
depends on whether or not what you do is going to enhance the welfare of the subject of your 
when you use an animal or a human being we are animals by the way too but when you 
a human animal just for your own purposes like enslavement come to recognize that is a wrong immanuel notion 
not turning people into simple instruments of your own needs and desires that they are end in and of 
and if we were to think about animals that way too it would put a natural limit on how 
we manipulate them sc well it certainly sounds like as a professional lawyer and bioethicist not gonna run out 
things to do any time soon full employment ac not as long as the scientists and the biologists keep 
what they do sc i think gonna do our best so alto charo thank you so much for being
