hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today going to go back into neuroscience 
very happy to have patricia churchland on the show patricia churchland is an extremely celebrated and influential neuroscientist and 
in fact one of her claims to fame is popularizing the phrase so as you might guess a philosopher 
mind but someone who thinks going to learn about the mind by studying the brain and tries to make 
between what happens to us as people our conscious selves and going on in the brain the neurons their 
their firings and so forth sc in fact i think that patricia is the first macarthur fellow to appear 
on mindscape you know the macarthur fellowships the genius grants so everyone we have as a guest is a 
in one way or another but officially a genius and her most recent book is going to be the 
talking about today which is conscience not conscious or consciousness conscience as in jiminy cricket as in the part 
our inner selves that says know you really be doing that or you really should be doing this thing 
not obviously a relationship here between this idea of conscience and other ideas talked about on the podcast the 
of our thinking and the parts of our selfhood that come from our brains and our bodies right not 
higher cognition rationality and so forth but the impulses that we have that make us who we are sc 
so patricia churchland has thought about these things more carefully than anybody going to talk about not only what 
is how it relates to emotions and intuitions and instincts but also how it relates to specific things going 
in the brain talk about oxytocin the cuddle molecule and talk about where this leads us in terms of 
and empathy right you know going to be a is versus ought kind of discussion in here we will 
completely resolve it but i think basically on the same side one way or another always a delight to 
to patricia churchland by the way her husband paul churchland is also a famous neuroscientist and philosopher and they 
two children both of whom became neuroscientists so maybe some genetic determinism going on there not sure sc anyway 
is a wonderful discussion patricia is always good to talk to not only because she has a charming canadian 
but also one of the smartest people i know so go music sc pat churchland welcome to mindscape podcast 
churchland lovely to be here sc i know that no academic in the world who would be happy to 
their entire career reduced to a single word but i have to say that you have a word that 
very associated with you namely neurophilosophy maybe you can tell us a little bit about what that is and 
it came to be pc well i think of neurophilosophy in the following way that it kind of works 
ground that exists between neuroscience on the one hand and the grand old philosophical questions on the other hand 
i sort of came of age so to speak at the time when neuroscience was developing to the degree 
you could begin to see that it was going to have an impact on all of the big questions 
do we make decisions and choose the nature of learning and memory how do we know anything nature of 
sc ancient questions yeah yeah pc ancient questions and i think one of the things that really motivated me 
the split brain results because here you had these subjects who because they had epilepsy that be treated with 
underwent surgery where the surgery consisted in separating the two hemispheres the idea was that you want the epileptic 
to travel from one hemisphere to the other and at first of course people thought that it really make 
difference to anything except the epilepsy that but then it turned out that if you looked very closely the 
so to speak knew different things were aware of different things and not like you had two people exactly 
the fact that one hemisphere could be consciously aware of something while the other one was not was really 
because it meant that all these years we had these abstract arguments about there a mind separate from the 
and if there is how does that and i thought this just makes it flaming obvious sc yeah pc 
consciousness can be split by cutting a set of nerve fibers game over now i want to do these 
anymore that are in the abstract what i want to do is understand the thing itself sc and when 
proposed this idea of neurophilosophy was that immediately well accepted throughout the various communities pc oh yes laughter pc 
it took a while to come to fruition at the time paul and i were on the faculty at 
university of manitoba in the philosophy department sc this is paul churchland pc paul churchland who is my husband 
and because things were not run as a really tight ship and we had a certain amount of flexibility 
decided that if i was going to really think about the brain in a thoroughgoing way i had to 
understand anatomy and you understand anatomy by looking at a twodimensional picture because the brain is a threedimensional thing 
so i went down to the medical school and explained my dilemma to the head of the anatomy department 
he said this is he was an englishman john baskerville hyde and baskerville hyde said this is great you 
come and do all of the neuroscience you want come to the neuroanatomy classes you should go to neurology 
and see patients and so and so as soon as i taught my classes get my old beatup jalopy 
roar down to the medical school and it was bliss laughter pc it was just the most eyeopening wondrous 
for me to really begin to understand what we did and know what we could know if we had 
tools and so forth sc but the philosophy the philosophers rebelled a little bit at this idea that there 
even be a thing called neurophilosophy pc so when i finally wrote the book and the book came out 
there was consternation by and large the philosophers hated it and still do they think the interesting thing to 
was that even philosophers who think there was spooky stuff who think there was a mind independent as the 
sc mentalists physicalists yeah pc they said brain is actually dan dennett was a great case in point he 
presents himself as being very brainfriendly but let me tell you in those days he was entirely brainhostile he 
say a difference between the software and the hardware i need to understand a computer in order to understand 
to work say microsoft word so since cognition is running software on the hardware i need to know about 
that actually makes sense that argument pc except it sc i think true not true not correct but at 
level of analysis plausible pc it was except it really because even at that time we knew very well 
the brain was not like a digital computer that the very connections between neurons changed as you learned something 
the memory box there ram and we knew that the processing was all parallel it like it is in 
digital computer and we also knew that very tiny changes at the microstructure could affect the nature of cognition 
and like you say in retrospect it makes sense because hardware versus software is a very human construct the 
did not pc well a very good point the brain did not evolve that way and in fact there 
a wonderful occasion when francis crick and i and dan dennett were having dinner and francis knew about this 
softwarehardware story of and so he started to push him in the inimitable way that francis had about care 
neurons and you understand how you get function except out of structure and if you understand the structure not 
to understand the so that was rather interesting but most philosophers had a lot of sympathy with take on 
there were other philosophers who thought that really the job of philosophers is to lay down the foundations for 
and so why would we look to science to do those foundations we the philosophers are going to tell 
what you can discover and what you discover is how we think by looking at the brain that was 
basic story sc and also if going to get into morality and consciousness and things like that and i 
that hopefully you can fill in but i presume that some of the philosophers thought that what is right 
what is wrong should be independent of going on in the brain pc absolutely sc maybe it will help 
think about how we get there but what the answers are should be true for computers and lizards and 
beings equally pc yeah yeah i think so and i think something like that was especially true about the 
of morality so there had been this longstanding project by longstanding i guess i mean in the century where 
the project was for philosophers to uncover this very special thing this ur rule that is the absolute rule 
applies to all people under all conditions at all times and what they would try to dream up and 
about it and go back and forth and it was all a waste of time chuckle sc well i 
if it was a waste of time but you would want to say well we should get into it 
older than the century right kant descartes aristotle probably and plato talked about what are the general rules for 
pc no interestingly this is something i find really fascinating is that actually just like there are two traditions 
the mind a physicalist tradition and then there is the dualist tradition so in morality there are all about 
and there are the people who say look rules are at best soft guidelines they apply to all so 
going to have people behave in a moral way there has to be something that is deeper than that 
what those are are the values that people pick up and why would they do that and here aristotle 
charles darwin all agreed it has to be something that is part of our nature sc as opposed to 
reason pc as opposed to pure reason whereas for poor old kant it was all about pure reason and 
demarcated in ancient greece a profound difference between aristotle on the one hand and plato plato who thought that 
absolute truths were in this abstract third realm that could be accessed through as he said intellection aristotle was 
man of the world sc an empiricist yeah pc an empiricist and he think that that made any sense 
aristotle was an obvious mistake on my part adding him in there i should have pc oh okay okay 
but plato and kant yes they did have this idea pc yes yeah they did sc that they should 
finding the right rules and so i wonder something that actually was spurred by reading a couple of your 
going to float a crazy hypothesis and tell me what you think pc okay sc because you mentioned along 
aristotle and hume as people who are more on the side not one simple rule a bunch of indications 
guidelines and work through it you also mention eastern traditions both buddhism confucianism pc absolutely absolutely sc and native 
traditions folk wisdom etcetera i wonder if the western philosophical tradition of looking for the one true rule has 
to do with monotheism even among philosophers who are not necessarily religious sort of the spirit that get the 
right answer which is maybe less congenial if a confucianist or a buddhist pc i think it is sort 
appealing it certainly appeal to hume and adam smith but then they were both kind of atheists sc yeah 
but perhaps something like the ten commandments is in the back of minds it was certainly in the back 
the mind of aquinas and almost certainly kant who was a christian but think that it was god who 
provided the rules he just provided us with the reason to figure them out yeah i think not surprising 
think a very interesting hypothesis sc well you tell a wonderful story about asking what the buddhist version of 
ten commandments would be pc well yes this was an amazing occasion it was arranged by one of the 
who started the department of neuroscience here at ucsd now gone bob livingston and the dalai lama wanted to 
about the brain and so bob collected a few of us took us up to los angeles where the 
lama was staying and we had these meetings with him and at lunch time i was able to be 
decent guest and i had a buddhist priest next to me and so i began the conversation and i 
of said in all my ignorance so what in buddhism corresponds to the ten commandments and of course now 
realize how embarrassing that was and how graciously he look embarrassed for me pc but it was amazing because 
he went on to talk about the very different style of thinking through moral issues that prevails in buddhism 
when the dalai lama then gave his public lecture he actually worked the same themes and it really had 
big effect on me because i thought i had not been particularly interested in moral questions as a philosopher 
least at that time but i thought well if buddhists are good people and they understand why important to 
honest and fair and why sharing is good and why we defend each other and so on and they 
these absolute rules that say you must always do x and y then maybe there is something deeply wrong 
the way moral theorists are looking at these things pc but i really pick up on it in a 
way because at that point i still really understand how neuroscience could ever really make inroads into understanding something 
empathy or loyalty or honesty i thought well how the we understand how stereoptic vision works so yeah then 
the heck are we going to get empathy i mean give me a break so i just put it 
the shelf sc but it raises we should get out of the way a little bit of the discussion 
the ought versus is problem so just so people know what we talk about a little bit here i 
the word neurophilosophy raises the danger that going to tell us going to do an fmri and then tell 
what is right and what is wrong pc yeah yeah sc not what you have in mind pc no 
that really is not i mean social life is so incredibly complicated that that be possible but what is 
amongst all of us is something that we of course also share with all mammals and that is the 
that makes us sensitive to others and it does so because we form attachments to others in the first 
to our children our babies our offspring and a kind of general platform that allows for the ambit of 
of myself where i see to my own food and warmth and safety for the ambit of my care 
expand so i see to the food and warmth and safety of others in particular of course to the 
pc and as you know anybody who observes animals at all knows how ferocious any mother is of the 
whether a mother rat or a squirrel or a bear a mother human they do the most heroic things 
we know a little bit now about the circuitry for that so we do see social behavior of course 
insects and ed wilson of course is somebody thought very long deeply about this but we know the social 
in mammals and in birds is different sc right and i do want to get to the mammals in 
but i still want to make sure that we understand that not claiming to derive ought from is chuckle 
yeah i think that the way to think about it is that our biological constraints put constraints on what 
make sense to us so that if you were to have a rule that said all first born babies 
be boiled in water and eaten people could not do that sc right the biology is a constraint pc 
biology constrains us and not just the biology of caring and affection but other aspects of problemsolving and so 
so there is a kind of limited way in which the science can say about a certain proposed rule 
as the obnoxious rule i suggested that that not a rule going to work sc right pc however having 
that i do agree with you that what we as scientists do is say see how the brain works 
is the way to laughter pc yeah you laugh but you know who says that sc no no i 
i do chuckle pc yeah sam harris sc yeah chuckle pc and i tried to talk him out of 
at one point but he was really very convinced that science endorses utilitarianism and it sc it no no 
and in the new book i do talk a lot about why science do that but in particular what 
can do is help bring facts to the table and as hume and adam smith were fond of pointing 
we want all the available facts but as a concerned citizen the scientist might weigh in on the dilemma 
it happens to be like we log old growth might bring the his own or her own opinion to 
table but it count for more because it comes from a scientist sc yeah pc and scientists who take 
moral high ground in this way are really hurting the case because the fact of the matter is there 
wonderfully deeply wise uneducated people sc who are very moral pc who are very moral who have the education 
the world so to speak whereas there are moral philosophers to whom you would never go for advice if 
had a moral problem sc who behave abominably right pc yeah and so i think not that the isought 
is so hard and fast that we want to take into account these biological constraints that are on us 
have physical limitations we have certain psychological limitations such as not killing your firstborn or any of your children 
so that makes the boundary a little bit fuzzy sc i think pc but having said that everybody already 
that sc exactly and everyone knows that learning things that are true about the world will be relevant to 
decisions we make in the world sure but there is hume understood this even though he never quite articulated 
cleanly as we would like he was making fun of other people rather than trying to make a systematic 
but there is at the level of logic you need some input other than descriptive facts about the world 
decide what pc yes you do you do and that can come from inside the scientist and his reward 
and his hypothalamus laughter pc it can come from inside the scientist but it can also come from inside 
carpenter and the fisherman sc yeah yeah and so i think that circle back at the end to ideas 
proposals for how we should think about right and wrong and morality but i do better than take the 
you took in the book which is trying to talk about our brains and how they evolved in the 
way that they did and you put a lot of emphasis on the transition at which mammals first appeared 
yes yes sc so great about mammals pc so great about mammals indeed well the thing is that we 
that mammals and birds but focus on mammals we know that they all in every case the mother cares 
the offspring and we are pretty sure that part of what happened was in the evolution of the mammalian 
system the wiring for selfcare was modified and repurposed sc so our listeners are all mammals so they might 
know that many other animal species care about their offspring pc yeah a salamander lays her eggs off she 
she care what happens to them it occur to her to care and even if she saw some bird 
away at them she might not do anything just go off and surf or whatever it is and so 
it is very different now as some of your listeners will know there are some reptiles who sort of 
care alligators famously we know whether an instance of convergent evolution or not but the question that i wanted 
ask about this thing about mammals is why did it happen sc right yeah and you start talking about 
origin of being warmblooded as a crucial point pc it seems that that was the crucial thing was that 
some point in our evolutionary past these warmblooded creatures who yet fully mammals they were warmblooded reptiles appeared sc 
talking two hundred fifty million years ago or something like that pc about two hundred fifty million years ago 
the great thing about being warmblooded was that you could do this really cool thing you could feed at 
and nobody else was there yum yum sc buffet is open pc and all these guys these insects were 
around waiting for the sun to come up and you could yes buffet so it was a great great 
however been observed that gram for gram you have to eat ten times as much if warmblooded as your 
cousins a huge constraint so the hypothesis is that over time mother nature so to speak realized that in 
to solve this problem of calories one thing to do is to be smart now a couple of ways 
can go to be smart one is to build it all in with the genes so that for every 
that arises you know what to do the problem with that of course is that when the world changes 
sc yeah pc the other problem is that it takes place over very long time scales whereas if what 
do if mother nature is you say crank up learning take those learning mechanisms and just crank the crap 
of them and then see if we get and that was basically the strategy and thus we see in 
and only in mammals this remarkable structure that makes us smart and the cortex now not that frogs are 
dumb not like rocks chuckle and they do learn but what they can learn is highly constrained and very 
whereas even a modest rat can learn a lot a lot about spacial organization a lot about what to 
how to get on and so forth pc so the great thing was then that warmblooded and going to 
smart but wait there is a problem if going to be smart then the neurons that you have when 
have to be able to grow because the only way that learning happens in nervous systems is that structure 
built so you gotta have the genes to make structure and the structure has to go to the right 
but if you gotta have lots of room in order to grow your brain then you have to be 
very immature sc just because you fit the big brain through the birth canal pc well not just that 
are sort of deep developmental reasons too that have to do with how far learning can go in a 
sc so if you want to maximize for learning you better be conscious and out there in the world 
as long as possible not in the uterus pc yeah right a nice way to put it yeah got 
be out there and your nervous system has to be immature so it can do all these things which 
other things are done in the egg so then the problem that somehow evolution solved was to say basically 
the only thing is got to have somebody take care of these highly dependent going to be smart creatures 
the only one around so cap so essentially then what happened was that the circuitry of the ancient structures 
hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when 
infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure 
they were warm and fed and so forth sc and this is a very typical strategy in the history 
evolution where you had something in your body that does something and rather than come up with an entirely 
system to do something new you adapt the existing system so here we had organisms which already had selfpreservation 
and we just sort of evolution said maybe we can extend that a little bit to your pc yes 
the pleasure and pain for selfsurvival was kind of repurposed and modified as well and so you get this 
of social pain and social pleasure sc empathy and love pc but it appears to have come from this 
fundamental system of selfcare but bear in mind too that selfcare go away once got a mother sc no 
yeah sc and then it naturally extends out to people beyond our offspring hopefully pc well depending on what 
i presume that in the history of the evolution of the mammalian brain probably in the early days only 
mothers did the work in the way that only the mother for bears but even in mice the dad 
helps and in other species of rodents the father helps sc like to think that in human beings the 
helps sometimes chuckle pc oh for sure absolutely for sure and so what we know is that much depends 
the species but the thing seems to be that once got the circuitry for care that sort of platform 
care in place you can tweak it a bit and you can tweak it so that now caring for 
and now we see things like the prairie voles or beavers where they mate for life they care about 
other they are biparental they both take care of the babies and humans which are different yet again not 
like beavers and not quite like chimpanzees so each species has its unique way of being social but pretty 
in humans there are big strong attachments within the family to mates to kin even to cousins to friends 
sometimes well beyond that sc we have to talk about the prairie voles those are crucial in saying not 
that some mechanism that makes us attached to other people our relatives and our friends and so forth but 
helping to identify part of what that mechanism is pc that was the thing that made me realize that 
was going to be a biological story about morality that i foreseen the story of the prairie voles and 
montane voles or lots of voles goes like this so there are many species of voles phenomenologically very similar 
look the same they kind of weigh the same they have about the same number of babies and so 
but socially very different so prairie voles mate for life after the first sexual encounter they stay together for 
and the males guard the nest they provision the females they huddle over the babies montane voles are completely 
they are what we sort of customarily think of as a rodent and that is that the male and 
female meet they mate and then they go their separate ways pc so when this difference in social behavior 
discovered some neuroscientists said the difference in the brain here got these two species that are so similar the 
in the and after a lot of false starts and looking and wondering they discovered that the neurochemical oxytocin 
a high density of receptors in a very special part of the reward system in the prairie voles have 
in the montane voles and there is a sibling molecule called vasopressin sibling to oxytocin it just differs in 
couple of amino acids and it turns out that vasopressin is also special in the prairie vole because here 
a high density of receptors for this vasopressin in a very special part of the reward system not so 
the montane voles pc with that correlation in hand then the researchers really went to work it and you 
all the manipulations and they showed it is causal now probably not the whole story sc of course pc 
we know that there are other things that matter but it is a significant part of the story so 
the bonding between mates is critical critically dependent on oxytocin receptors sc and i am all on board with 
idea that this is a big part but very complicated and you should emphasize the complications but i still 
the idea that oxytocin is the cuddle molecule chuckle pc well it just blew my socks off when larry 
came here to the salk to give this talk it had a very worrying title and i went nyah 
nyah and i just sat there my jaw dropped that something as simple as receptor density could be the 
of something that we thought of was socially extremely subtle and complex monogamy i really yes sc and they 
on and off the levels of oxytocin or the efficiency of the receptors and the monogamy comes and goes 
comes and goes sc and just something that human beings are going to find scary even if you would 
someone our behavior ultimately an expression of what goes on in our and they said yes but then you 
the molecule doing it or the system molecules doing and that scares us a little bit that pc it 
sc if someone could turn off the receptors for oxytocin in my brain and i would not be in 
with my wife anymore terrible pc yeah yeah yeah yeah it is terrible but on the other hand somebody 
put a hole in my head in a certain place and i be able to talk anymore sc or 
dead pc or be dead right sc these are physical effects that definitely affect who we are pc but 
is a remarkable discovery but as you say of course complex but the other part of the story that 
really love is that oxytocin works handinhand with the endogenous opioids and the endogenous cannabinoids that our brain makes 
of the pleasure you feel when you pick up that crying baby and you hold it and it stops 
and you feel that wonderful softness and so forth a lot of that is endocannabinoids which to say high 
to say that the pleasure of that is dependent on certain neurochemicals and the endocannabinoids play a big role 
and just to be very clear for the nonexperts among whom i include myself these what talking about are 
chemicals neurotransmitters that get received by individual neurons so basically the existence of these chemicals in the right parts 
the brain will make us more empathetic or whatever it is than not is that roughly the story pc 
roughly the story the thing is that the way neurons work is that they have a little receptor on 
and only when the molecule fits into that receptor that the neuron has a response to the molecule and 
receptor density is really important because if you have a ton of oxytocin flashing around in your brain but 
got no receptors it going to help so you have to have the receptors there and one of the 
that i think was so important that came out of this work was our understanding that these two have 
to fit together sc and how does it work when my cat jumps on my lap and starts purring 
that oxytocin flashes in my brain so how does the brain know what is the where does the oxytocin 
from pc the oxytocin comes from the hypothalamus and released in the hypothalamus but also in cortex now it 
a while for us to know that because the first things that were looked at of course were voles 
there so much in voles in the cortex but in monkeys quite a lot and so released from these 
when we have these warm social interactions now part of the reason for mother nature really care if we 
good or not evolution care sc right there has to be some purpose pc so the thing and the 
really is that when the stress hormones go up oxytocin goes down but when oxytocin goes up the stress 
go down and so oxytocin makes us feel good and so then we can do certain things and if 
nature and you want this mom to take care of these babies you want her to feel good about 
so you raise her levels of oxytocin when caring for the babies and things are going well you raise 
stress hormones when the cats are around sniffing out the babies and that provokes or initiates different behavior patterns 
you know we think of oxytocin as being the love molecule sc the cuddle molecule pc yeah the cuddle 
but the fact is that truly truly ancient well before mammals and just that it was repurposed evolution being 
it is it was repurposed in mammals so that there is this relationship between stress and oxytocin levels stress 
down when oxytocin goes up and super important when you think about the sociality of mammals and how mike 
once said to me you find it odd that there is as little murder amongst humans as there now 
meant this in a joking way sc sure philosophy joke pc but what yeah but what he was pointing 
was that often people are really really annoying and irritating and they say stupid things and they do stupid 
remarkable is how we just let it roll off sc we murder them pc we mostly chuckle pc and 
was i going with this oh yeah so oxytocin is really very important for all kinds of social functioning 
of course as you know there are social species where there monogamous pair bonding as there is in voles 
in titi monkeys and to a first approximation humans sc is the was it some arbitrary choice for what 
molecule would be is it basically just signaling the fact of empathy or compassion or is there something actually 
that molecular structure that is useful to that particular neurochemical use pc a really interesting question and thought about 
and i think the neurochemists would probably be able to say more about it than i could it does 
levels of stress and so when stress levels are lower and this could be in a lizard when stress 
are lower that allows certain other things to happen and so part of sociality just that drawn to each 
but that when not threatened and the stress levels go down then comfortable and then then then maybe we 
cooperate on something and so highly social animals find it of course very useful to have fairly high levels 
oxytocin so they can accomplish things jointly sc this discussion is amazing it fires up a couple of issues 
going to throw them out there tangents but then come back one tangent is does this kind of discussion 
obstacles for people who would want us to upload our consciousnesses into computers where the equivalent of neurons but 
not the equivalent of these hormones that are changing the receptors pc yeah i see how you could do 
at this stage i and it just oxytocin of course also vasopressin and the endogenous cannabinoids and the endogenous 
which play a really i mean we think of them as well we know them via street drugs right 
they play a hugely critical role in bonding between parents and offspring and in bonding across community and in 
managing to get on with each other even though the other guys are a bit nasty or smell bad 
do bad things and so forth pc so the biochemistry the whole story is of course very very complex 
in a certain really important way oxytocin and vasopressin are at the heart of it but i do want 
stress the importance of the opioids and cannabinoids sc yeah and but i not always but had wonders worries 
the matrix about the idea that we could have our existence inside a simulated environment pc i think so 
in principle sure possible but i think that the people who think about it undervalue the importance of the 
that in a body our brain so we get tired we get thirsty we get irritated and sort of 
something else we have all these hormones being turned on and turned off to change how our brains work 
so even if we can do it in principle really not going to going to even more complicated than 
out what every neuron does pc i think it is i think going to be super complicated because if 
if you imagine that neurons communicate with just one neurotransmitter and all there is to it well you know 
it like that and the neurochemistry is really really complex and there are many fundamental issues which are still 
resolved sc good and then the other tangent that i wanted i need to ask this almost every single 
all of these facts about the relationship of chemicals in our brain and how we behave and think brings 
questions about free will pc yeah yeah yeah for sure sc so is there nevertheless a space for talking 
people as autonomous decisionmaking agents or are we just bundles of chemical networks pc well it depends on how 
really want to think about free will and certainly there is space for contemplated choice or what you might 
want to call rational choice almost certainly the brain is a causal machine and we certainly do feel differently 
make different kinds of decisions as a function of the neurochemicals that happen to be sloshing around at a 
time when really tired not the same as when you have just woken up on the other hand the 
issue of free will really arises in a very special context it arises in the context of the law 
of holding people responsible sc blame and responsibility pc and there the question is whether or not we want 
hold somebody anybody responsible for antisocial things that they do like just for the sheer fun of it murdering 
kinds of folks and on that question it seems that we proceed really by looking at sort of stereotypical 
of people who really are out of their minds and people who do really terrible things but are not 
of their minds and so somebody like bernie madoff who over the course of twenty years ran a ponzi 
that was extremely elaborate i happen to have met him once actually sc oh pc yeah pc you invest 
hope pc no no crazily enough it was at an mit event and i was seated next to him 
a table and i tried to make conversation with him and he having it sc before he was a 
criminal pc yes before he was a notorious criminal it happened i think about six months later so he 
probably uncommunicative because he was sc he was thinking about it pc he had more on his mind than 
conversation with a californian but in the case of someone like like madoff where it was clearly forethought and 
worked out of course got to hold them responsible sc it was not a crime of passion pc it 
not a crime of passion so the distinctions that the law already makes are actually in many ways very 
are there things we can do to improve the law part of which would be applying the law as 
actually is sc that would be nice yeah pc that would be nice but the fact that we are 
machines is not really relevant in the case no excuse for bernie madoff to say a causal sc right 
so good so yeah i think completely on board with that and consider our tangents to be closed we 
come back to the story of mammalian evolution and evolved this capability of feeling empathy toward other people and 
we going to say this is the precursor of our moral instincts and intuitions pc yeah i think something 
that is all highly social animals have some sorts of rules about how they get on and what they 
do and when they have to stop fighting and when okay to have a short fight and so forth 
of those rules may actually be part of their innate endowment some of them may have been socially constructed 
time went on and i really think of morality as a kind of socially enforced set of constructs that 
into being and different for different communities living in very different conditions the moral system that worked very well 
the inuit in the century for example is very different from what might have worked very well in paris 
the same time pc so these were people living in small groups they knew that they were living in 
harsh conditions and that you have certain kinds of crime like murders and when people get along especially when 
get along because they were fighting over women they had these very elaborate rituals where they had a kind 
what they called a song duel it kind of translates into that and so they would have a day 
so to make up their songs and then everybody would congregate in the igloo and one guy would sing 
song which was usually nasty about the other guy and sc a diss track pc yeah a diss track 
then it was to be resolved there was to be no more no more fighting because if living on 
knife edge of survival and your hunters kill each other bad sc yeah okay pc so particular moral styles 
think grew out of this sort of basic hardpan kind of caring and wanting to be with others that 
provided by oxytocin sc just loop back to the philosophy of morality discussions you have a very good chapter 
your book about the rule givers and the utilitarians so explain these different traditions in western philosophy or visavis 
pc yeah it is a very interesting tradition and i have to confess that i very interested in moral 
either as a graduate student but certainly not as an undergraduate it sounded to me like going to church 
sc have to be good or get punished pc but i got interested in moral philosophy really as a 
of the prairie voles and realizing that these really quite strong behavioral patterns could emerge as a result of 
simple chemical changes and having the appropriate neurons in the appropriate place so there are within the philosophical tradition 
are the people who think of rules as kind of the be all and the end all and the 
who think that you can have rules of thumb and really kind of about it but that if people 
up in the right kind of atmosphere with the right kind of community they will have the right dispositions 
they need to rely on these highly specific rules so kant of course belongs in the rule group sc 
if i understand correctly and people who listen to previous episodes of the podcast a wellknown distinction between deontologists 
consequentialists people who think that right or wrong and and what you do versus people who think the right 
wrong and and the consequences of what you do lumping both of those people into the rules camp a 
pc right thank you for that so if i can just diss philosophy departments for a while most philosophy 
have ethicists who say really two traditions in philosophy the utilitarians and then there is the the guy who 
i never said that pc yeah yeah yeah yeah and neglecting a whole rich interesting tradition that includes aristotle 
course hume david smith confucius and a few other fairly smart folks pc so when i thought about how 
could be that the oxytocin and the related neurochemicals in the brain affect social behavior it seemed to me 
the rule guys the deontologists and the utilitarians really have much to offer so that was the basic way 
i wanted to look at it sc and in some very real sense both part of this tradition of 
using pure reason the right way to act pc using pure reason and of course everybody knows that when 
moral decision is made that there are lots of emotions involved too now we also know that you want 
emotions to run away with you and so forth but that the emotions do of course play an extremely 
role sc and you have in the book substantive objections to both the idea that you can be a 
like kant or you can be a utilitarian like mill pc yeah yeah yeah and mill funnily enough come 
as quite the bad guy because i think he realized especially later in life that utilitarianism had had tremendous 
but that it worked to a first approximation if you look too closely and on the other hand the 
philosophers and many thereafter liked the idea not of just relying on good judgment and internal sense of propriety 
want rules chuckle sc so sympathetic with it i think that evolving personally i think that i was a 
growing up and now moving into this nonrulebased camp but part of me an argument that says i knew 
every specific instance in every conceivable circumstance what the right thing to do was or not even know if 
had an opinion about that i can always reverse engineer a rule that recovers all of those it might 
a very very complicated rule is the problem with rules that simple rules are just too simple or is 
a more metaphysical objection that pc i see a really really good question no the problem is that not 
enough and that we are smart enough to recognize an exception to the rule and to realize that everything 
be a lot better if you just tweaked it a bit here and tweaked it a bit there and 
all know of morally really really decent people who always adhere to the rules they are sometimes especially merciful 
occasion or they are sometimes especially kind on an occasion and so forth and so it seemed to me 
when when people really look at on offer from utilitarians and from deontologists like the kantians it really map 
to the real social world in a very comfortable way on the other hand we do like things to 
cut and dried we look at confucius for example or hume or smith who are not giving us precise 
and we think how do you ever get it sc just too fuzzy pc can i be sc yeah 
should be an answer yes a very pc a very human quality we want to know and we everybody 
that if you do what martin luther sorry martin luther said which was relying on your conscience because god 
always give you the right answer no wrong that sometimes our conscience up to it certain things we foresee 
we were too young or we were too tired or we were too scared sc always thought a parallel 
moral philosophy and bureaucracy in the sense that you start from some good goals and then you make up 
list of rules and then you forget what the goals were chuckle and you stick with the rules and 
rules become important and why bureaucracies are terrible because just a matter of following the rules pc i love 
analogy actually that is an interesting analogy so i understand that hard to think about being moral in the 
that say confucius would recommend or that aristotle would recommend but it be that hard because the confucians do 
and not noticeably more immoral than are say christians or jews or people who adhere to very specific rules 
and so certainly not deriving ought from is but it does sound like you are being inspired by the 
realities to take them into account when we try to think about when we construct our view of how 
be moral pc we do i think how we get to the point of making moral decisions is really 
understood in some sense a constraint satisfaction process but we not saying anything very substantive we really know how 
works and not that i think we ever but i think even close at this point and i grew 
on a farm and the farmers where i grew up nobody had any education but these were smart good 
interesting people and i often go back and i think about the conversations they would have at night and 
the supposed to be in bed listening away to them and there was just a lot of good common 
and then i contrast that with some of the philosophical discussions i hear in philosophy departments and i think 
compute for sc well let me bring up the obvious worry about this that people have i necessarily have 
myself but just moral relativism saying that whoever wants to make up whatever rules they can make up like 
you give me an absolute guideline everything descend into chaos pc it is a really interesting question and somehow 
think theologians have sort of taught us to believe that sc i said exactly those words pc thank you 
because you know i mean are confucians and buddhists in that problem i think so they seem to do 
well and i have a friend a child psychologist experimental psychologist in canada and in vancouver a nice place 
compare how asian children and how kids who have are fourthgeneration canadian how they differ firstgeneration asian and fourthgeneration 
and they differ in really quite interesting ways the canadian kids when presented with a moral dilemma say the 
is and the asian kids say it could be this but is do we know about x do we 
about y because if z then we have to do something so they do come from a tradition of 
about it in a different way now that mean not saying that the christian kids are totally messed up 
anything of that kind because i think in their actual life they behave sc very similarly right pc as 
asian kids do sc because the urge to find the rule that will clarify it with them pc but 
urge to articulate and say what doing but mostly not what doing sc right laughter pc which i think 
really terrifically interesting sc well and that comes back to the title of your book is conscience i keep 
to say because of course also done a lot of important work on consciousness but conscience it conjures up 
me the fact that we human beings are not these unified cells we have lots of different voices talking 
our heads and we anthropomorphize the conscience as jiminy cricket like a separate voice talking to us and neurobiologically 
makes all the sense in the world how do you see that role of the conscience inside ourselves as 
into the moral conversation in our brains pc well you know not sure and part of the reason not 
is sort of historical and that is the greeks never had a word for it the greeks to whom 
look for such wisdom in all of these matters sc socrates did have a demon pc socrates had a 
sc not quite the same pc it quite the same so where did the word conscience come from well 
it was invented by the romans and it was to mean knowledge of what is expected of you in 
of the law but then of course we have it means something quite different to us now but there 
the greeks for hundreds of years merrily talking about the nature of ethics and values and how to think 
it and whether they were other worldly or this worldly and they have a word for it so i 
to myself important is this sc yeah pc and then i look at how people actually use the word 
been observed by many linguists that it mostly only comes up in the context where something goes wrong and 
sc your conscience have prevented from doing that pc your conscience be bothering you and so forth sc yeah 
because and as you mentioned very early sometimes our conscience is not right right like another part of our 
that comes from evolution and training and so forth and it serves an important purpose but by no means 
final arbiter pc yeah no and certainly not infallible heaven knows and you know you look back on your 
sort of life especially as an adolescent where you would claim you were doing this for reasons of conscience 
you think god help me and oh why somebody just sort of set me straight on so yeah i 
how important the word is but i chose to use it for a book because it does resonate with 
we are really interested in and that is our moral understanding and what it rests on that is the 
and the innate sort of circuitry that it rests on and how it can grow and develop as you 
a person in the world sc so is there a word for this school of thought that is more 
or buddhist or aristotelian that is not rulebased heard virtue ethics pc yeah sc used as a term is 
a good one or no pc i know it sort of is and i tended not to use it 
the reason i tended not to is that the virtue ethics people those who are philosophers that is to 
are not really interested in the brain at all sc right pc they want to do it all without 
about the brain and i think it sc they want to read the iliad pc yeah yeah i think 
not going to work not going to work sc yeah it seems like i guess this is a good 
to start wrapping up so i was going to say as sort of the final question how do you 
the future progressing in terms of the conversation between morality conceived of as a bunch of good ideas that 
have but necessarily simplifying the rules and our improving understanding of the brain and all of its little subsystems 
together pc i know i think really hard to say i i used to think that that only the 
of dumb and religious people took courses in moral philosophy when i was an undergraduate i know very bad 
me but i did i now think about it rather differently i think a really really difficult subject because 
know if thinking about a single brain and how a single brain manages to organize itself so the body 
can walk a tough problem sc already hard but chuckle pc already hard but when talking about how groups 
individuals manage to get on then i think really really difficult on the other hand i never would have 
the oxytocin story it absolutely blew me away francis crick and i used to talk about morality a lot 
he really wondered what the basis for it was he said it just be that taught he thought kant 
just up a tree and it he was much more of the humean persuasion as i was so that 
kind of a bond between us i guess sc i have to find some kantians to get on the 
definitely slanted towards the humeans by a big margin myself pc well in the minority i mean if you 
to the philosophy meetings the kantians are coming out of the woodwork sc they are yeah chuckle pc and 
is really horrendously complicated how we managed to interact but on the other hand kind of amazing and this 
of takes me back to mike gazzaniga is how well actually we do get along i mean of course 
that there are terrible laws and there is class warfare within the nation and so forth nevertheless as mike 
put it given how annoying other people are surprising how few chuckle sc and how fairly easy it is 
kill people really in the modern world pc how fairly easy it is to kill people sc and it 
gives me a little bit of focus on a narrower scope but this kind of perspective is a different 
of thinking about the relationship between science and the humanities right pc i think it is i think it 
sc a way of saying that the relationship is that the humanities should be subsumed into sciences and this 
not that this is a true conversation pc yeah i think it is i think it is and i 
paul and i and our kids used to sit in the hot tub at home and have these long 
about morality and whether there was any point in studying it or understanding it this was long ago of 
and i would just despair i mean i think if not going to understand anything about really how the 
is interested in these things and where these social urges come from not going to make any progress but 
i kind of feel i feel very differently about it i mean i think this is a very deep 
of all mammals all mammals the highly social ones are very striking because they live in groups but actually 
evidence that those mammals who are loners actually have a suppression of their sociality in order that they can 
alone because they need to for their own ecological reasons but now it does seem to me that there 
really deep things that we can understand about the nature of sociality and how to get better and so 
sc and is it fair to say that if willing at the philosophical level to say that morality is 
that we construct and base in sort of informal ways on our intuitions rather than pure reason then knowing 
about how the brain works and how the chemicals inside it work provide a useful starting point for finding 
what our commonalities are and how we can work together pc i really think so i really do think 
and i think that would actually be an amazing and quite wonderful sort of thing i mean there are 
huge questions that remain any sensitive person of course realizes how dreadful it is to incarcerate people who break 
law and of course when i used to teach philosophy there were always undergraduates who would say know gotta 
a better and sometimes at some point in our development there will be a better way in the meanwhile 
course hard to know what else to do i mean psychopaths are pretty scary folks sc but i like 
i think given we given ourselves a little optimistic place to end and see how things are moving forward 
to see that also a little bit of progress even in philosophy as far as concerned chuckle pc yeah 
except i know i think well as a sort of rough index of whether philosophers take what i have 
say seriously i am never invited to give a talk in a philosophy department or almost never whereas been 
over the world of course to talk to neuroscience departments and i think because they really want to hear 
message now i think the next generation will sc i think things are changing yeah pc and so hopeful 
i think i was just very naive i thought philosophers would think wow this is really and they did 
sc well choose to be hopeful about the next generation chuckle sc all right patricia churchland pc okay thank 
sc thanks so much for being on the podcast pc thanks a lot music mammal i did a quick 
search of legal and judicial theory for the term and failed to find a cite therefore i claim i 
coined this term without more in relation to legal theory whatever comment sorry patricia and sean but sam harris 
not say that science endorses utilitarianism and in multiple places he specifically says he is not a utilitarianor a 
i think you should go back and read this httpssamharrisorgthinkingaboutgo indeed very untrue how sam harris is portrayed patricia 
a big mistake tot mix the moral opinion of a scientist with scientific knowledge about what makes humans feel 
and what harmes them in order words to study the biological basis of morale behaviour you implicitly have concepts 
good and bad consequences all harris claims forget this century witchcraft and read genealogy of had a more penetrating 
of himself than any other man who ever lived or was ever likely to sigmund freud excellent episode i 
twice as i do with all of the good ones because my mind is so inspired to wander that 
miss out on things the first time i am slightly perturbed the sam harris apologists here i thought her 
was both well stated and honestly fairly muted perturbed by the bem so posso dizer que me completamente excelente 
obrigada patricia e sean this was a fascinating conversation but it seems to me that there was a lack 
appreciation for the unlikely happenstance that two mammals were talking to each other about how mammals are controlled by 
brains energized by various chemicals in regard to the unconscious autonomic brain it makes perfect sense but there is 
transcendent about the use of words to convey ideas comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds
