episodes and the like but this is the officiallynumbered episode to celebrate i decided to treat myself to a 
episode in which i reflect somewhat nonsystematically on the ageold question of the meaning of life i end up 
a lot most of the time talking about the meaning of ie what it means to be a living 
in a naturalistic universe but then i go on to muse about the construction of human meaning in a 
where values are not imposed on us or objectively grounded in physical facts i think life does have meaning 
important to understand what forms it might take i settle largely on the idea that humans can conceive of 
possible futures assign value to them and work against the natural order of things to create something that otherwise 
not have been this is far from the final word even in my own mind an invitation to think

other perspectives on the meaning of life click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone welcome to the 
podcast your host sean carroll and a question for you what is the value of a human life this 
not a completely academic question of course right now struggling with the existence of a pandemic going through the 
world the novel coronavirus disease is causing people to wonder how to balance getting the economy and society more 
back to work versus the possible cost of deaths because people are spreading the virus back to each other 
the answer if you wanna know the value of the human life is between about five and ten million 
the number that economists have thought of if you go into an industrialized country if you look at the 
value of a human life you need to put a number on it i know that in some sense 
think that life is infinitely valuable to the person living it all they have if they lose that life 
other loss that really matters sc but on the other hand you just say i will spend all of 
resources to save this one there has to be a limit because there might be someone life that also 
saving so how do you spend your money how do you just do that cold hard brutal calculation and 
answer is if you wanna know how much money it is worth spending economically to save a life it 
out to be between about five and ten million dollars but this is a different question that i want 
answer today although a closely related question the question i wanna think about is why life has a value 
all why our lives matter right gonna talk about the bigpicture question of what is the meaning of life 
should we care about it at all now as you know i am not necessarily an expert on the 
of the meaning of life but on the other hand this is the version of the mindscape podcast the 
sc not actually the episode because had bonus episodes and holiday messages and stuff like that but this is 
one hundred in the numbered episodes of mindscape so i thought be worth a little selfindulgence if you like 
treat myself to be able to talk about a subject which not an expert in but i have thoughts 
and very much in the spirit of mindscape on the one hand i want to talk with experts who 
something to say who know something but on the other hand i wanna encourage everyone to talk about everything 
wanna talk about it in an educated way but i think you need to be an expert to have 
on things no matter what your level of expertise is by all means have opinions and talk about them 
other people just being willing to update and change your opinions when experts explain to you why not right 
so gonna explore a big topic the topic for which there might be no other topic that is bigger 
this is not necessarily about finding the final answers to the meaning of life about thinking out loud thinking 
the issues that are relevant both scientific and philosophical because they both matter and what be talking about how 
matter why things have meaning at all now i let you go quite into the podcast without admitting and 
that in a very strange time right now not just because of the quarantine but worldwide things are going 
not just climate change and threats to democracy worldwide but as i record this in the middle of protests 
violence in the united states sparked by the killing of george floyd by police in minneapolis i just myself 
through my first ever curfew citywide last night in los angeles we were told not to leave our houses 
eight pm and am sc a different thing than being under quarantine where told to stay at your house 
the sense of not going out and socializing but you can still go out to do shopping and other 
things this was a different situation for very very different reasons and in a sense a related reason right 
movement that started a lot of these protests came from the black lives matter movement the point being of 
the wise guys that say all lives yes that misses the point the point of the movement was and 
lives matter are lives black lives are lives they should matter just as much as any other lives and 
feeling that not gonna get into today but broadly sympathetic to that we treat black lives and certain other 
here in the united states as being worth less as mattering less and i think that that is a 
a mistake not what gonna be again facing today but i do wanna acknowledge it sc and i also 
to acknowledge that a complicating factor when you wanna talk about science or philosophy or for that matter art 
cooking or whatever to acknowledge that the world is going through struggles outside and those struggles hit everyone equally 
people are struggling more than others and i do appreciate that and so a question of whether or not 
should be thinking about abstract philosophical issues or cosmology or particle physics when a police brutality and shops and 
being looted on the streets of the country that in let me just say that it is exhausting it 
can be really wearying really trying not just to live through the realities that living through but to fight 
them to try to make things better right and if any direct relationship with what be saying in podcast 
going on in the world around us that i think the lesson at the end is that the struggle 
worth continuing that as exhausting as it is as tiring as it is as distracting as it is from 
things you might want to be concentrating on it is worth the effort to keep your chin up and 
to make the world a better place sc we might disagree with each other about what that systematically operationally 
to make the world a better place but we should be able to agree that worth the effort and 
saying even though it can sound trite but worth repeating because it is a struggle a real struggle different 
have different capacities for dealing with it in different ways and important to recognize so not about upbraiding anyone 
about how to deal with the situation but about encouraging those who are trying to make the world a 
place to make their individual lives better to make the lives better of everyone around them that is something 
worth doing that does have meaning that matter so with that go music sc those of you listened for 
long time know that not somebody who thinks that science can answer every question i love science what i 
very very important but science has a role and that role is figuring out what happens in the universe 
the universe is made out of how that stuff behaves how it interacts how it changes in other words 
role of science is descriptive rather than prescriptive the role of science is not to say what should happen 
to say what does happen nevertheless even when talking about an extremely philosophical topic like why does life have 
and what is that meaning my predilection i can not possibly stop from first thinking about the science behind 
in this case if gonna say what is the meaning of life then you can sort of equivocate a 
bit about the meaning of the word meaning and rather than talking about meaningfulness in life we should perhaps 
by talking about the meaning of the word life the definition what is it that we mean when we 
the word life sc and one of the great things about this topic is because so broadranging gonna get 
chance to remember a whole bunch of things that said in previous podcast episodes with previous guests so talked 
the meaning of the word life in the context of life on other planets a little bit we talked 
it with kate adamala with sara imari walker with kevin hand all of them were thinking about exobiology and 
on other planets but we sort of skipped by the details of that discussion we brought it on to 
table thought about it a little bit and moved on we had a focused discussion on really what we 
mean by the word life when is something in the universe qualify as being alive versus not being alive 
i mentioned that because it will be a future podcast episode i think it has an important thing to 
in on so be talking about that but for today not gonna necessarily need the once and for all 
of the word life what gonna need is some properties okay some aspects some features of life be relevant 
this question of what is the meaning with the capital m of our individual lives sc so not a 
of background here okay gonna matter a lot for example whether the person asking this question is religious or 
in principle and i do not want to spend time justifying my personal beliefs about religion and otherwise i 
a thing worth doing but not in this particular episode of this podcast so rather i will just be 
you what they are so that you know what my commitments are as they say in the philosophy circles 
are to what you might call naturalism in particular physicalism that is to say there is only one world 
natural world people sometimes think that hard to define naturalism because what do you well how would you know 
something was supernatural or nonnatural or not i think something difficult to define about naturalism i think actually difficult 
define is supernaturalism when would you know that something did not fit into the natural order of things but 
again not trying to find the once and for all definitions i just wanna tell you where i am 
from and so my version of naturalism is physicalism by which i mean there is only the physical world 
ground so in contrast people like david chalmers or philip goff would at least previous mindscape guests who talked 
consciousness and panpsychism sc they would at least be open to the idea that in addition to the physical 
of the world the material stuff that makes us up there are also mental properties even if only physical 
even if not a dualism between physical stuff and mental stuff they would still argue that at least conceivable 
even advisable to imagine that physical stuff has mental properties as well as physical properties so i am not 
there that is not where i am coming from imagining that when we talk about life talking about something 
is a physical all the way down and important that learned as learned about physics and biology and other 
learned something about that particular thing that we call life most importantly it is fundamentally a process it is 
a substance so not only is there no separate mental realm like descartes might have imagined where disembodied mind 
somehow communicates with your physical body in a very obvious kind of dualism but also no kind of fluid 
stuff that qualifies as living versus nonliving living is a property that different kinds of material can have under 
right circumstances sc and this is a very traditional common move in the progress of science we realized that 
that we thought was a substance is actually a description of some kind of process a famous example is 
right it used to be thought that heat should be thought of as a fluid that could move from 
thing to another and the name of that fluid was called caloric and this makes perfect sense in a 
of ways if you take two blocks of metal one is hot one is cold and you put them 
contact with each other so touching they equilibrate the hot one becomes a little cooler the cool one becomes 
little warmer and what it is exactly like is the flow of a fluid from the hot thing to 
cool thing like if you have two tubs of water and you connect them by a little tube they 
reach an equilibration where both of the tubs have the same level in between right so not crazy or 
wrong to think of something like heat as a substance but then you do the science you learn what 
made of you realize that all of this stuff is made of atoms and the atoms have little jiggly 
that you keep track of and what you mean by heat is the average thermal energy in those jiggly 
so a description of what is going on in the actual stuff but the actual stuff are the atoms 
a separate thing that is the heat sc likewise for life just like heat you would not be completely 
to think a priori that life was a thing and it was in some things that we called living 
and that life was not in other things right some élan vital or life force that left your body 
you died again not completely crazy but also not correct that is not how life actually works in the 
point of view that we now have that i now have people who agree with me now have that 
discussed in great detail in my book the big picture if you want more details here life is a 
of talking about certain reactions certain dynamical processes characteristic of certain kinds of collections of atoms and particles and 
stuff okay again not here to justify these statements just letting you know what they are but we can 
a little bit more deeply not just that life is a process a particular kind of process sc by 
what i mean is some people i did a debate years ago about whether life after death one implication 
my view on what life is is that there is not any life after death because life is a 
and the process ends when you die no place for the information that contained the essence of you to 
when you die and your physical body ceases to exist no mechanism for that to be preserved outside your 
body and one of the questions i get in a debate like that is smart alec where does the 
go when you when alive you have energy right you can move around you can run you can jump 
you die you so where did the energy go and from this perspective of life as a process a 
reasonable answer to that which some people get and a lot of people seem to not quite believe when 
give it to them sc but the the same as where the energy goes when you turn off a 
or where does the energy go when you put out a candle the answer is it go anywhere still 
the energy is not a fluid either the energy is a description of stuff and the energy stopped doing 
that it was doing right not that it went away when you have a flashlight with batteries inside you 
the flashlight on the batteries are doing something making electrical current flow through a filament and lighting up sending 
through the room that in and when you turn the switch off the energy go away it just stops 
that particular thing when you turn off a candle a chemical reaction when the candle is burning that is 
the substance of the wax of the candle and combining it with oxygen in the process of combustion and 
off light and heat thereby and when you put the candle out the energy that is locked up in 
wax that could potentially burn just stops burning it stops changing in that particular way it stops that particular 
sc so what happens when we die right dying is part of living something gonna happen to us all 
a cessation of a certain set of chemical reactions going on in our body okay and that leads into 
fact that life is not just any old process but it is a particular outofequilibrium process so a lot 
processes the word process is a very broad thing the planets going around the sun is a process in 
sense but no one is going to mistake planets orbiting the sun for being alive just on the basis 
moving okay one of the features of a living organism is that it is an open system a living 
exchanges energy but also information and influences with its surroundings so a living organism is a certain kind of 
object which manages to maintain some sort of structure even though it is changing over time sc and different 
of change in a living being right it can change just by walking around and moving some of us 
anyway like a tree maybe very good at that but living beings can grow again some of them individual 
maybe grow very much but multicellular organisms certainly do and living beings can change just from day to day 
can go to sleep and so forth a certain kind of change but a very specific kind of change 
simply motion kind of a maintenance of a structure over time that would not necessarily have been maintained under 
circumstances erwin schrödinger who talked a lot about in the last year or two in the context of quantum 
later in life he wrote a little book called what is life and people made that book very famous 
wonderful book to read this was the before we knew about dna or anything like that but schrödinger in 
sense predicted the existence of dna because he said there must be a way for information to travel from 
to generation and what kind of physical system can do that sc we knew that information traveled from generation 
for a long time but schrödinger as a physicist is saying what kind of actual informationcarrying substance could it 
and he figured out that it needs to be some sort of thing that was rigid enough to be 
of like a crystal sort of lasts from generation to generation but it just be a regular crystal it 
something that is the same over and over again because no information is conveyed by passing on something like 
so it has to be what he called an aperiodic crystal something that has structure has information but is 
just repeating the same structure over and over again and basically what a dna molecule is a dna molecule 
a list of little base pairs in a particular order that can be preserved from generation to generation so 
are sorry that was a little bit of a digression a very important part of book but i think 
an equally interesting part of his book is his answer to the question in the title what is life 
that gets a lot less attention and not gonna get the exact quote here but roughly speaking what schrödinger 
is that life is a physical process that continues on long after it stopped sc now a contentious kind 
definition to give what do you mean have after all the earth goes around the sun for millions and 
of years it never stops like how do you know when going to stop but what schrödinger is trying 
do is to distinguish between something like a ball rolling down a hill which is an open system the 
can bounce it can emit noises there is friction etcetera etcetera and the ball will generally roll down or 
rock or whatever roll down to the bottom of the hill and stop it will not pick itself up 
climb back up the hill whereas a living being when you feed it when you give it the stuff 
needs from the outside world can keep going a person unlike a rock or a boulder can not only 
down the hill but then back up and then down and then back up again and not in a 
way by taking in free energy from our environment why in book he talks a lot about entropy and 
energy sc very roughly speaking you all know if listening to this podcast that i like entropy and a 
of the disorderlyness the randomness of a physical system and very roughly if you have a system that has 
total amount of energy you can divide that energy into the high entropy energy the useless energy the energy 
is in the form of just heat and random motions and then on the other hand what we call 
free energy the energy that is locked up in some way that can be used to do work like 
up a mountain or something like that and schrödinger tried to relate that to negative entropy and i really 
very helpful but the point is useful energy free energy and useless energy and tropic high entropy energy and 
what schrödinger is saying is that what a living being does is take in free energy from the environment 
through photosynthesis out there and the sun taking free energy from the rays of the sun or we human 
might eat other organisms and get free energy from there and we use that to maintain our structure sc 
if you think about it a person can sit still a welltrained monk or mediator can sit extremely still 
appear from the outside not to be moving but a different kind of stillness than a chair or something 
that a chair maintains its structure on the basis of the fact that it is made of things that 
not themselves moving right a chair is made of little pieces of wood which is made of molecules which 
basically sitting there in the same configuration over and over again you might call that a microstatic kind of 
in place whereas in a living organism is not microstatic because no matter how good you are at slowing 
your breath and your heart beat and not itching or anything like that not wriggling in your seat still 
going on inside you your heart is beating you are breathing atp is being generated blood is moving through 
system signals are being sent through your neurons and so forth all that is happening beneath the surface while 
in fact the point of a lot of these motions is to maintain your basic continuity of physical structure 
so remember when i talked to antonio damasio and he emphasized the role of feelings in the maintenance of 
so what a living being has a living being has a homeostatic kind of stationary continuous existence versus a 
existence we can be more or less the same what schrödinger was getting at we can maintain our structure 
integrity over time not because made of things that are stationary but because made of things that are churning 
doing the work keeping us in a more or less continuous structure and what damasio thinks of as the 
of feelings he thinks that feelings are ways that our bodies or our brains feel that we are deviating 
the place or the equilibrium we want to be in and then we sort of move back toward it 
what homeostasis is the restoration of that sought for equilibrium structure and something that is very very important about 
life becomes homeostatic is that it is through processing and exchanging not just energy with the outside world but 
so a classic example of a homeostatic system is a thermostat you put a thermostat on your wall you 
it and you say keep it between seventyone degrees and seventytwo degrees fahrenheit for example okay sc and a 
simple straightforward thing a very not very complicated mechanical gizmo inside that will adjust the heat or the cooling 
keep you at the same temperature and homeostasis but the kind of homeostasis that a living organism goes through 
much more elaborate than that right constantly getting information from the outside world and from inside ourselves exogenous and 
if you wanna be technical about it and adjusting in very complicated and subtle ways not only are we 
immediately regulating the temperature of our bodies but also thinking and we are reacting in potentially complicated ways to 
world around us okay so building all this up because i wanna emphasize that part of being a living 
is this maintenance of the structure over time through processes through the things changing and part of that is 
and reacting to the world in ways that involve the exchange of information learning about the world contemplating the 
sc simple organisms will do this in extremely simple and perhaps trivial ways more elaborate organisms will do this 
much more elaborate ways and at the end it ends this is a feature of life that i already 
one feature of life is that it is temporary okay all going to die had a podcast about this 
with megan rosenbloom about the death positive movement facing up to the fact that one day we are all 
to die from a cosmic perspective even something like a bacterium which you might say bacteria are immortal they 
sort of split and they die of old age you can kill a bacterium but they die they run 
with their ordinary life span they just undergo fusion into two bacteria but cosmically speaking the sun is gonna 
out gonna fall into a black hole the black holes will evaporate at some point every living organism is 
to cease to exist so whatever the meaning of life is it involve a search for permanence in any 
way because you achieve permanence in life sc whatever the meaning of life is going to have to face 
to the scientific fact that life is temporary okay again given my commitments to naturalism and physicalism and so 
which i am very very committed to okay so i think all we need to know or think about 
the nature of what is life but i do wanna talk about a little bit more detail about this 
of life that we exchange information and we think about the world because that comes into this notion of 
that is crucially important again in the big picture i talk about emergence at great length and one of 
important features of emergence i mean very roughly speaking emergence is a sense in which at a higher coursegrained 
of description there are patterns that describe what happened which might not have been immediately evident if you just 
at the microscopic fundamental level okay now a lot of debate and dissent and disagreement about what we should 
mean by the word emergence and then people go around defining weak emergence and strong emergence and so forth 
not gonna get into all of those fascinating questions right now sc at the technical level what referring to 
is weak emergence okay not strong emergence but what i wanna get at is the point that these emergent 
descriptions can be of a completely different character than the lowerlevel description so a classic example of emergence is 
i have a bunch of atoms in a box of gas i can describe them using kinetic theory i 
describe every atom i know where it is okay it has a location and i know its velocity or 
momentum and then in principle i could use the laws of physics to say what all the atoms are 
do using laws or whatever quantum mechanics if i need that or i can average things out right i 
say if i take a little tiny region maybe a cubic millimeter of space and i can figure out 
total number of atoms in there and their total momentum etcetera i can define a temperature and a density 
a pressure in different directions and from that i can find description of the air in the room in 
of a fluid right it has those fluid properties and i can forget the fact that really made of 
sc that is an example of emergence i have a description of going on in the air in terms 
a fluid that in some sense is way simpler i need a lot less information to accurately model what 
happening in the air in the room than is contained in the more comprehensive atomic description okay that is 
feature of emergence that is absolutely central it is the appearance of a useful pattern based on incomplete information 
example of a kind of real pattern as daniel dennett talked about in my podcast with him not subjective 
not just our inability to see the atoms that matters there is a real structure to the nature of 
system that allows us to describe the air in the room as a fluid even though it does not 
use of all of the information and very crucial sc my favorite example of emergence is actually well the 
of gas is a good one but another one that seems even simpler think about the earth going around 
sun okay we think very natural that if you give me the position and velocity of the earth and 
know laws of gravity i can figure out how it moves around the sun okay not surprised by that 
if you think about it that is an enormous simplification because the earth is a collection of atoms right 
ten to the power of fifty atoms and in principle every single one of those atoms has a position 
a velocity and the idea that i can give you a tiny amount of information much much smaller than 
full specification of the position and velocity of every atom and yet get useful information to be able to 
what will happen next is amazing so what i give you is the location and the velocity of the 
of mass of the earth so i give you random information i give you some very very specific information 
and from that center of mass position and velocity i can predict the motion of the earth but if 
someone said gonna give if there are ten to the fifty atoms in the earth if gonna give you 
position and the velocity of ten to the fifty minus one of them but not gonna give you the 
of velocity of the remaining one what could you tell me about where the earth is gonna strictly speaking 
answer is nothing at all i mean maybe that one atom has as much momentum as all the other 
in the earth combined but in the opposite direction okay if you know what that one atom is doing 
predict anything and an extreme example but let me give you a slightly more vivid example what if i 
you the positions of every atom but not the momentum of any of them given you half of the 
that there is to know about going on in the earth and you can predict precisely nothing about what 
the earth is moving in sc so the generic situation in physics the generic situation is if you give 
all of the information about a physical system i can predict almost nothing about what it will do emergence 
an example of this sort of narrowing of the phase space of the system to a very very much 
set of possibilities which nevertheless give me some handle on what is going to come next that is a 
feature of the universe a real pattern as dan dennett would put it and anyway again i got enthusiastically 
from my point my point was that the example of the earth and the center of mass is very 
we can understand it but also not characteristic of emergence in many other cases because in many other cases 
emergent description might seem very different from the underlying more fundamental comprehensive description sc in the case of the 
the description is the same for the individual atoms you would give me positions and velocities or for the 
of mass you would give me the position and the velocity but in the boxofgas example the description is 
little bit different right instead of giving me positions and velocities you give me fluid descriptions temperature pressure density 
that seems a little bit different but maybe it seem as different as it could be the point is 
in a world where trying to describe emergent properties of open systems the emergent description that you have might 
different inkind might be an entirely different kind of description than what you have at the lower level sc 
in particular what i wanna emphasize is that the fundamental laws of physics as we understand them are momenttomoment 
are laplacian and in the sense of pierresimon laplace and demon right if you tell me everything about the 
right now i can tell you the next moment and the previous moment using the laws of physics so 
laws of physics as we currently understand them at the fundamental level are not teleological systems do not reach 
into the past or predict into the future very very far in order to figure out what to do 
systems are not oriented towards goals according to our best fundamental physics that we have today and why saying 
is because wait for it the emergent description of subsystems of the universe might very well be teleological sc 
reason why not okay just because the underlying description is not teleological just moment to moment that mean that 
best description our most compressed most successful real pattern that we identify is necessarily equally moment to moment it 
very well seem teleological that is allowed by the fact that we do not live in equilibrium okay we 
an arrow of time we live in a universe where a difference between the past and the future ultimately 
because entropy is increasing stop me if heard this before entropy used to be very low in the past 
will be higher in the future it is changing and that gradient that change in entropy over time allows 
the existence of real emergent patterns that treat the past and future very differently no obstacle to that in 
and allowed to ask then does it happen in practice so in particular i want to suggest that even 
like purposes can emerge at the higher level of description sc and really gonna do a very slapdash job 
defending this this is a controversial idea in the philosophy of science in general or metaphysics or whatever you 
call it but on the side that says that things like purposes and goals can be emergent phenomena now 
should sit back a little bit and think about the fact that there are different things that you might 
when you say the word purpose one use of the word purpose is sort of the use of something 
is the purpose of this hammer it is to hammer nails into the wall even if purely biological what 
the purpose of the long neck that a giraffe has is it because it wants to it enables the 
to reach food up there high on the trees or is it because giraffes of the opposite gender find 
long neck very sexy and are more likely to reproduce for you with you or anything like that i 
a little bit about with neil shubin on the podcast about the pressures that evolution does and does not 
you for different things sc and you could have an attitude that would argue that the vocabulary of purposes 
just inappropriate when you talk about the length of the neck you could say what keeping track of or 
i should keep track of is the genome of the giraffe right the genetic information contained in the dna 
that is going to be passed on from generation to generation and some of it will be passed on 
some of it is less likely to be passed on and through various kinds of pressures the kinds of 
that got passed on gave giraffes longer and longer neck over and there described what happened and i never 
the word purpose of the the phrase purpose of the neck is to help the giraffe reach leaves high 
the my point is that you can talk that way but i can also talk in the language of 
at the emergent level i can simultaneously believe that there are no purposes to electrons or protons and neutrons 
obeying the standard model particle physics and that there is a purpose to a hammer or to the neck 
a giraffe sc one simple way of saying it is of course there are purposes in nature because in 
and i have purposes i have reasons why that i would like to do things so a difference with 
that something part of the most fundamental comprehensive description and saying something exist at all but when talking about 
meaning of life remember that is where we eventually wanna get here we talk about meaning in that sense 
word meaning and the word purpose are often conflated and in fact very similar to each other related not 
independent but the meaning of life does not come from a purpose in the sense of something that is 
used for some purpose that would be or could be true if you are not a naturalist but a 
if you thought that god or some other higher being created the universe and created human beings for some 
then that purpose could be inherited by us human beings that will be perfectly okay sc that is not 
that going to help myself to so therefore the idea of a purpose as a use imposed from the 
is not going to be relevant to my conception of what the meaning of life is but another idea 
what you mean what you might mean by the word purpose which is simply a goal right my purpose 
doing this is to reach this target in the future okay what i care about is achieving a certain 
of thing so my purpose doing this in order to achieve a certain kind of thing and here i 
this is a relevant conception to when we think about life in the real world even as physicalists again 
example i think i gave this example on the big picture i used this example otherwise but think of 
cat chasing a mouse okay two different ways many different ways but consider two different ways of describing what 
going on sc one way of going on of describe going on is to give all of the microscopic 
about the cat and the mouse in their environment all of what their cells are doing all the signals 
sent from neurons the pumping of their heart and so forth an enormous amount of information in terms of 
presumably you could very accurately predict going to happen next or you can just say cat is trying to 
the mouse the cat has a goal the cat has a goal which is to catch the now that 
not be able to give you quite as reliable rigorous careful predictive capacity but you get a lot for 
little information this is exactly that kind of emergence that talking about whenever you can describe something with some 
some amount of real information predictive power for example attached to your description that requires a lot less input 
the microscopic information about the system talking about then you have emergence sc so if you have an efficient 
then to people like me or to people like dan dennett you call that a real thing it really 
maybe it only exists at the emergent level but never less real it is not an illusion so to 
extent that a cat has the goal of catching the mouse goals are real purposes in that sense are 
things not something okay to talk about and to be fair there are layers here a spectrum of complexity 
we talk about goals and how they emerge as it were so a bacterium a famous fact about bacteria 
that if you put it in a petri dish with a gradient of nutrients so more nutrients on one 
of the dish than on the other side of the dish the bacterium can figure that out sc the 
can move itself in the direction of the higher concentration of nutrients okay in some sense that is operating 
a goal the bacterium would like to be happy and in the region of the petri dish that has 
nutrients but not a very rich sense really not a very necessary sense by saying the bacterium has the 
of being in a higher nutrient part of the dish not any simpler than saying the bacterium moves in 
direction where more nutrients right just as a fact equal amounts of information either way you need to use 
goaloriented language but as life evolves as it becomes more complex our ability as living beings to conceptualize the 
becomes richer becomes more complicated so a very simple being a bacterium or a very tiny little organism basically 
in the here and now a bacterium does not have a nervous system it does not have the ability 
conceptualize and keep images of the outside world inside of itself sc no symbolism in the brain of a 
because it does not have a brain but as nerve systems evolve and as we evolve brains organisms extend 
reach from just the here and now to greater sized regions of both space and time so i suspect 
an expert on this an expert on the biology i suspect that space came first i suspect that primitive 
first figured out how to represent different parts of their physical environment right now around them i talk in 
big picture about the example that was given to me by patricia churchland another podcast guest about a certain 
of c elegans little nematode roundworm this study said the nice thing about c elegans is we know how 
neurons there are and mapped them all out like three hundred some neurons we know exactly how many there 
not that many and there was a claim in a study that said one single neuron could be pinpointed 
having part of its job was to distinguish between forces that acted on the nematode from within itself endogenous 
versus from the outside world exogenous forces sc so in some very vague sense this could be thought of 
says as the beginning of selfawareness the beginning of telling the difference between me and the rest of the 
but of course that capacity becomes richer and richer and richer as time goes on as we extend our 
capacities right and time in particular is something that really becomes very useful when we learn how to not 
think of the present moment but to think about other moments in time the concept of mental time travel 
physically traveling to other moments in time but remembering the past and imagining the future this is something talked 
in different ways on several different episodes of the podcast with jenann ishmael with laurie paul we talked about 
our selfconceptions are bound to different ways of thinking about the past and future remember the one i had 
on with malcolm maciver who studies how fish climbed up on to land and start looking around sc and 
makes the point that you can at least to some extent and this is always gonna be messy biology 
nearly as clear and precise as physics but to the extent that you can make these statements maciver wants 
argue that fish climbing on the land was in some sense the birth of imagination because what he says 
if a fish under the water you see very far in front of you can see a few meters 
attenuation length of light traveling through water and moving at meters per second so you have all of the 
pressure on you is to make a very quick decision when you see something you have lot time to 
alternative possibilities whereas when you climb on to land and now the attenuation of length of light is basically 
you can see for kilometers in front of you now a new option that your brain has which is 
contemplate different future possibilities so i believe it is true that evolutionarily we first evolve the capability to remember 
a part of our brain that becomes devoted to memory to storing information about our past experiences sc and 
it becomes useful to hypothetically imagine future possibilities we basically repurpose that part of the brain to also be 
little stage on which we can put a play and we can imagine different scenarios this was what you 
think of as the birth of imagination the first time when the living being can really think about the 
of all possibilities and so what opens up the possibility to us of an emergent description of living beings 
ones that have goals because they can contemplate future possibilities a much richer thing than a little bacterium is 
not just that responding to the pressures or the incentives of the instantaneous moment and point in space but 
a much richer environment of possible things to do and thinking about them so also the importance of cognition 
in here not just responding instinctively or subconsciously but thinking about things rationally and reflectively that goes hand in 
with the importance of imagination and the space of possibilities sc now you might remember that i had a 
with karl friston who advocates this idea of the free energy principle in the context of basin models of 
brain and what friston wants to argue is that what our brain tries to do is to come up 
a model of the world that minimizes surprise that we want to sort of be surprised as little as 
now and this is tricky thing and i think that people have trouble both on the formal level understanding 
on there but also they have difficulty in buying it because they say plenty of times i do things 
do not minimize my surprise i watch movies that i know gonna happen next spoiler alerts are bad i 
sorry spoilers are bad i do not want to minimize my surprise i want to be surprised and response 
that is sure but in a simple organism it would just try to minimize surprise in a more complex 
because of this mental time travel capacity what you might want to do is minimize your net surprise over 
future okay you might want to anticipate the fact that surprising things are gonna happen to you and therefore 
surprise to yourself so ready to deal with sc so i think i like that answer a little bit 
quite sufficient to me and not gonna blame karl friston it might be that i just understand what he 
trying to say but it would still be true that you could just lock yourself in a dark room 
sit there not doing anything and you would never be surprised the problem is not that imagining a future 
which you might be surprised the problem is that you would die if you just locked yourself in a 
and sure that karl friston knows this perfectly well but get quite around to asking about it the point 
that we simply try to minimize a surprise that be it full stop right we have other constraints there 
other things we need this goes back to point about homeostasis we get hungry we get thirsty we get 
we might want to reproduce we might want other people to approve of us a whole bunch of motivations 
people do have in the moment that get in the way of the simple goal of just minimizing surprise 
maybe you can say something like our brains want to minimize surprise subject to all of these really complicated 
working at cross purposes in some sense sc maybe a theory in which you can think about the origin 
goals and the origin of purposes from that perspective i know but interesting to think about and the other 
here about the relationship of human beings to the past and the future reminds me of the discussion with 
taylor from a very different perspective we talked about the future of democracy and why democracy is important something 
talk about very much i think but was in book was the idea that interesting how we human beings 
ourselves under obligations to the wishes of people who are no longer around we in our society say that 
people have rights right and most obvious example a person can die and leave a will and that will 
can give instructions and say money should do this and if you mow the lawn every week gonna take 
your even after your dead we respect those wishes and in some sense why do we do that worth 
why do we care what dead people think not around to approve or disapprove of us sc and partly 
maybe even at this advanced stage of human civilization many of us really believe that gonna die maybe we 
that even after we die we still exist on in some ways and the people who already are dead 
watching us and disapproving of us absolutely maybe subconsciously part of our motivation but i think a more important 
which is that here and now as we are alive we want our wishes to be obeyed in the 
we can imagine again mental time travel we can imagine that someday we will be dead and we would 
it to be true that once we are gone our wishes for our inheritance or whatever are still respected 
therefore by some reflection principle we say we should respect the wishes of people already died so again and 
i think very important as one of the foundational features of what it means to not just be a 
being but to be a higher level advanced cognitively living being is a projection of ourselves into the space 
possibilities in the future as well as into the space of what did happen in the past and gonna 
important coming up when we talk about meaning sc okay so talk about meaning i laid the ground work 
much as i could for on the science side of things trying to explain how i think about what 
means to be a living thinking person or organism but where do we get these ideas about values like 
i take it that the meaningfulness of life is one of the values that we have and this is 
be a contentious subject closely related to but not the same as the question of morals morality or ethics 
how that relates to science those of you who listen to my podcast with sam harris he was not 
my show but i was on his show we talked about ought and is something that i talked about 
my blog my book and so forth and in other places but on the side that says just like 
hume scolded us about you cannot derive ought from is and this is a longer conversation again just telling 
my commitments here not really justifying them but my attitude is that science tells us what happens in the 
it tell us what ought to happen sc science is necessary if our values are going to make sense 
if we understand what is true and real about the world then going to come to incorrect conclusions for 
most obvious one your values might be very different if you believe that you are created by a loving 
allpowerful god than if you believe that you evolved through natural selection you might believe that god has given 
instructions in the sense of some particular sacred text that tells you what to do whereas if you believe 
then you think that there must be some other origin of your values so clearly your understanding of how 
world works can affect your values in important ways all i wanna say is if a naturalist they do 
determine your values you just say this is how the world is therefore this is how it should that 
just a nonsequitur is just a violation of the rules of logic okay sc so what that means is 
if you live in a world where an objective reality out there i talked with liam kofi bright about 
that means for there to be an objective reality out there and how to get it but that objective 
give us instructions it does not tell us what is right and what is wrong it does not tell 
what the meaning of our lives is the other thing i wanna emphasize besides the fact that not going 
derive meaningfulness from science any more than gonna derive morality from science is that that mean we talk about 
what it means is that there is no objective grounding to our meaningfulness of life just as there is 
objective grounding to our morals but that mean that they exist we can subjectively construct meaning just as we 
construct morals a difference between being subjective and being arbitrary i give many different examples here usually in terms 
something like basketball i like watching basketball and playing basketball sc there are rules that we invent in basketball 
threepoint line you double dribble you foul all these things we certainly made these rules up these rules are 
out there to be found in the fundamental laws of physics we could have made up other rules indeed 
are constantly tweaking the rules a little bit but it would be entirely wrongheaded to say that therefore the 
are completely arbitrary some rules for a game like basketball or chess or whatever you wanna contemplate are better 
others and the reason why better is because they fulfill some purpose some goal better than others when we 
basketball we have various goals we want to have fun we want to make it an exciting game and 
forth exactly the same for morals or for meaning we have goals we have emergent things that we would 
to have happen and from those we can go to construct rules of moral philosophy or meaning in life 
in some sense the morality example is a good one even though different than meaning and probably say this 
but the reason why morality is different than meaning is morality has to do with other people sc morality 
how we treat others how we want to be treated whereas meaning in some sense is more singular more 
us what is the meaning of our life it can be related to other people clearly other people can 
important in it but if you were on a desert island when you were literally on the only person 
existed it would be hard to talk about morality but it would still be very straight forward to talk 
meaningfulness you could do more or less meaningful things even if you were alone so not exactly the same 
so in some sense long story short i think of moral philosophy as a codification of our inner subconscious 
for how we want to treat other people and how we want to be treated so even though not 
moral realist i do not think that moral structures are out there to be found in nature that are 
objective and foundational i do think that there is work to be done under the rubric of moral philosophy 
taking our inner preferences the various inclinations and intuitions we have that come from a variety of places they 
come from our biology they might come from our upbringing they might come from our cognition thinking about them 
bringing all these preferences to light to the clear light of reason so that we can think about them 
sc the job of moral philosophy is to turn our inner impulses into a system that makes sense rather 
just this and that impulse which we sort of reach for like this better i like that think about 
ask ourselves is it that we like better how do we want to be treated by others ask other 
how they want to be treated talk to them get their opinions and figure out what moral system we 
i think in this process and by the way whether or not you think that that is what should 
whether or not you think that in other words morality is constructed rather than objective hard to deny that 
is what actually happens what actually happens in the world is that people contemplate what they want to be 
case and they talk to other people and they try to figure out a system to live by so 
that what happens is not the end of the world not anything goes or anything like that the good 
is that individual people have largely overlapping preferences for how they want to act and be treated not a 
there will be disagreements and there will also be as sharon street puts it there can be a more 
caligula sc there can be a person who just has moral impulses for which the rest of us are 
by them and just will never agree with them and the point is that you argue with them that 
are wrong on the basis of logic or science or reason okay what you can do is put them 
jail or you can stop them from causing harm in some way or another and again that is what 
actually do so the fact that people who have different moral systems than us are not making logical or 
mistakes mean that no hope for having moral conversations and i think the other thing i wanted to say 
that is when we do this process of moral philosophy when we go from admitting that we have certain 
for how we want to act and be treated to trying to make it into a system that is 
and internally coherent easy to oversimplify a very easy mistake that can be made of the following form my 
point is a set of moral preferences that are subconscious in some way that are ingrained in who i 
i try to turn them into a logical coherent system and then i realize that the logical coherent system 
constructed suggests that certain things are moral that are completely at odds with the preferences i started with right 
so an example and this is a intentionally contrived example so complain that not giving you a realistic example 
you said something like the following like to be happy i like other people to be happy when i 
to them they like to be happy okay there seems to be more happiness in the world when everyone 
happy therefore i will invent something called utilitarianism the simplest version of which is just the greatest happiness that 
possibly exist i will imagine that i can measure the amount of happiness in every individual person and i 
add up that happiness maybe i will call it utility so not just happiness but some higher level concept 
the point is i added up okay sc different people have different amounts of utility gonna add it all 
and i seek to maximize utility i seek to have the most utility the greatest good for the greatest 
what i wanna and that seems like a relatively a cartoon a caricature sorry utilitarians just using you as 
example here but it seems like not a completely crazy version of reasoning from moral impulses to a system 
but then someone says i have just realized that this particular person has very a large number of healthy 
in them very healthy person and i have twenty other people all of whom have one or the other 
bodily organ that is going to fail soon and going to so on the basis strictly of maximizing the 
of the world i should kill the person with healthy organs and give all their organs to twenty people 
save their lives sc and just so that not made sad by it i will do it in secret 
the people who get the organs know that they caused another human life to disappear in order to save 
lives so now saved twenty lives at the cost of one increased the utility of the world most of 
would say i wanna do that i think that is a moral thing to do that person who is 
innocent has a right to live their and nitpick thought experiment the point is in principle completely possible that 
construct a system that violates our starting points in some dramatic way and what i would say so two 
ways to go when you say that one way to say is the system is always right i do 
admit the possibility that i invented the wrong system so if i reach a preposterous conclusion i should train 
to be strong enough to accept it and some people will do that the other possibility is i do 
very good job of systematizing my moral inclinations in the first place sc what is trying to be taught 
something like the famous trolley problem the trolley problem where the trolley is gonna hit five people but you 
push a switch that would switch it to a different track and only kill one person and the point 
not an answer the point is not that there is some correct thing that we can derive is it 
to kill five people or one people the difference is if it were just kill five people versus killing 
person most would say killing one person is less bad but the point is that you have to actively 
the one person so complicated more elaborate versions of the trolley problem where you have to stop the trolley 
pushing a person into the path of the trolley rather than just flipping a switch and the point is 
this trolley problem is trying to get at the fact that our moral inclinations come in different forms some 
are yeah more happiness all around is a good thing but other forms are individuals have rights right individual 
sacrificed sc where you get people like deontologists like immanuel kant who says you should treat people as ends 
means and people have individual rights all by themselves that are not subservient to the common good i am 
here to actually adjudicate between these different systems of deontology rulesbased morality versus consequentialistversions of morality what trying to 
here is okay okay to have these competing impulses and i think that the right thing to do is 
resist the urge to oversimplify when we turn them into our systems i do think that moral systems should 
logical i think they should be internally incoherent or selfcontradictory but they could be fuzzy they could be like 
to increase the greatest good for the greatest number most of the time but i also want to protect 
individual rights or obey some certain kinds of rules and therefore here are the guidelines that i figured exactly 
what doing is constructing our system sc we start with values then we construct philosophical systems from them we 
to admit that the construction might be inherently fuzzy because our own understanding of our initial inclinations might itself 
a little bit fuzzy all of this will have implications for finally what getting to now which is the 
of meaning the meaning of life why are we here what are we doing about it why do our 
matter sc again like i said before related to questions of morality but different also by the way different 
happiness you might just say if morality is the greatest good for the greatest number i want everyone to 
happy maybe the meaning of my life is that i should be this is a turn that many people 
made in recent years a more individualistic version of the meaning of life where trying to be happy themselves 
i like it well i think meaning anyway i think happiness is overrated i think that happiness is a 
thing but i think a goal i think that not like the point of life is to be happy 
then stay exactly that way i think that a mistake the philosopher owen flanagan when i talked with him 
i interviewed him for the big picture suggested the following thing to think about when you think about people 
meaningful lives in the sense of having an impact on the world socrates buddha jesus martin luther king florence 
whoever people who have really done something to change the world and hopefully a positive way but we can 
about that not the point sc the point is flanagan says you think about these people as people does 
first thing come to mind is it that they were happy do you think about these people or they 
happy all the time that what they achieved by fighting against social injustice or something like maybe they were 
is completely possible that they were happy not saying they but saying it the point even if they were 
even if they really struggled inwardly it would not be evidence that they did not have meaningful lives that 
lives matter being happy is fine but different different than having meaning in your life likewise meaning like i 
is different than morality morality is more about how we treat others how we want to be treated by 
a social kind of phenomenon whereas meaning even if not just happiness meaning is still individual again it can 
related to other people you can find meaning in being a good person in being moral right that can 
the source of your meaning but not what meaning is you could also have sources of meaning that had 
to do with other people you can have your secret project that gives you a great pleasure and gives 
to your life that no one else ever knows about sc and so meaning is closer but still not 
the same as this idea of having a purpose or having a goal i did the podcast with scott 
kaufman about his updated view of abraham hierarchy of needs and he wants to replace the pyramid that is 
ever draw the pyramid but the usual popularization of hierarchy is a pyramid scott wants to replace it with 
sailboat which i like because it goes back to that idea that life is a process that life is 
changing but where i pushed him is that he thinks that sort of the well the culmination of the 
thing is transcendence not quite sure what that means but in the actual sailboat the topmost piece was purpose 
a purpose and i think a little not quite on the nose closed but not exactly what pointing at 
purpose has this connotation that we talked about of having a goal right i presume not purpose in the 
of being used for something not thinking of ourselves as hammers and screw drivers but i also think that 
a goal is the most important point in life sc because the thing about goals is they can be 
you can get them right like my goal is to walk across the street and i walk across the 
and done it meaning fulfilled by some specific achievement again achieving things can absolutely be part of how you 
meaning in your life but not what meaning is it might be a driver but not identical to it 
i to write a book on psychology and the meaning of life rather than a sailboat i would pick 
surfboard not even a surfer myself i go surfing but i think about life as a process and this 
this goes back to the happiness idea this idea that we find a perfect happy place and just stay 
be the source of meaningfulness in our life life is a dynamic process pushed or enabled put it that 
by entropy increasing and life is temporary so to imagine that the meaning of life that the purpose of 
was to achieve happiness and then just stay there would be like to imagine that the purpose of surfing 
to sit perfectly still on your surfboard and not gonna do it gonna not succeed gonna fall in the 
sc the story of surfing is making constant adjustments being in constant communication with your surroundings and adjusting trying 
maintain that homeostasis that upright stance that success in surfing for just a little while and you notice something 
that tickles me about the surfing analogy is that motion you move when on the surf board not fulfilling 
you just take your surfboard out there and to perfectly calm water and sit there that does not fulfill 
goals in surfing but also not a matter of getting anywhere this is why saying that having a goal 
not quite the same as having meaningfulness in your life when surfing you just move toward the shore and 
the wave peters out and then you go back and you do it again and the net amount of 
traveled traveled individual distance but back and forth positive and negative and at the end you come back to 
where you left and actually a much better metaphor for life i think it reflects not only the fact 
life is homeostatic and needs to respond to the world around it that life is dynamic and change is 
important part of it but also that temporary right sc that every ride on your surfboard or even your 
day of surfing comes to an end and you get anywhere at the end of it and you came 
with nothing you left with nothing but still there is something to the journey in between even though not 
journey between a and b a journey between a and a in a very complicated way the journeying matters 
surfing is actually fun in some sense so finding meaning in life is a little bit more elevated than 
happiness and surfing maybe part of your meaning your life could be surfing i guess like i said not 
a surfer but close close to that idea of having a goal and i think that somewhat closer to 
aspiration the not that there is a specific goal in front of us but that there is a direction 
which we want to move some way in which we would like our lives to be different than they 
be i like to think that meaningfulness can be thought of as a codification of our aspirations inside our 
aspirations for our lives just as morality is the codification of our preferences for interacting with others sc slightly 
things but a similar sort of parallel construction we start with aspirations we start with things we want to 
true or directions we want to move in and we think about them we bring them to our conscious 
and we try to figure out what is the system what is the reasonable way to put all of 
things together so i wanna dive into that a little bit more deeply but first just so not surprised 
the end let me emphasize the importance of the fact that in this point of view meaning is being 
meaning is not objective tried my best to read other people talking about meaning of life stuff and i 
get very far it just quite speak to me and a lot of times not necessarily all the time 
a lot of times because the implicit goal in such a project is to come out with the end 
say is the meaning of life here is the right very rarely do they succeed in doing that but 
even think that the question sc i even think the goal a meaning pluralist i think that all sorts 
meanings that one could have if you think that meaning is constructed by starting with the fact that we 
aspirations within ourselves and we sort of systematize them and figure out what they are and then move toward 
in some way those aspirations can be simple they can be as simple as a bacterium moving in the 
of more nutrients or they can be extremely complex they can involve very impressive feats of imagination thinking about 
possibilities and meaningfulness can be something that is fulfilled from moment to moment it could let me put it 
way we often think about finding meaning in life and what instantly comes to mind is some amazing achievement 
a great scientific discovery or climbing mount everest or making a million dollars what i want to suggest is 
one little tiny achievements can also bring great meaning to life sc maybe you have a really good doll 
maybe you make a really big ball of twine in your backyard okay but also there are processes that 
happen every day that can be sources of meaningfulness in your life living a dutiful and honorable life going 
work on time and doing your job raising your family putting food on the table making a good meal 
even just having experiences you forget about other people like the experience of going to mount everest might be 
important the experience of having a good meal that someone else made might be important the experience of having 
really nice vacation or just hanging out with your friends these are also things that you can aspire to 
that can bring meaning to your life so what doing without yet completely finishing the project of being careful 
what we mean by meaning just emphasizing the fact that not one size fits all not that some right 
to the question should your what should the meaning of your life once we admit that meaning is constructed 
individuals then gonna find different gonna be pluralistic about what their meanings are sc you can find meaning in 
rules or in breaking them if you wanna go into the podcast with michele gelfand about tight versus loose 
different ways to be successful either individually or socially visavis your attitude toward rules you can find meaning and 
experiences but you can also find meaning and familiarity if you really like the ritual at the end of 
day of having a glass of wine with your loved one or your family or you like the experience 
going out to the movies thursday nights or whatever great that is absolutely a way that you can find 
you can find meaning in artistic expression in learning new things in discovery in changing the world but also 
being a good friend doing a good job at work keeping a happy home petting your cat and listening 
it purr okay these are all ways that we can find meaning in our lives these are all versions 
the aspirations that we have i wanna make that cat purr when i pet it when i give it 
in exactly the right place sc and finally not necessarily in comparison with others even if you think of 
having yourself having aspirations did you want to achieve something in some way not that you wanna achieve something 
is better than anyone else again it might be i mean maybe you want to have the biggest ball 
twine in the backyard of anyone in your state good for you very few people find meaning in having 
of a mediocre mediumsized ball of twine but not the only thing it could be really what i wanna 
is that much more a comparison with yourself than with others two important things what i wanna suggest without 
is the correct meaning to have in your i wanna suggest that two things are very important to it 
i think that it needs to be conscious or selfaware even if not aware that what doing is finding 
you have to be aware that you are doing something that you need to be doing that it just 
necessary part of your life sc meaningfulness come from just existing meaningfulness does not come from just surviving from 
waking up in the morning look surviving daytoday can be hard get me wrong it can be a struggle 
may be it is all you can do and maybe a struggle to even do that and no disrespect 
the kind of situation in but not where you get meaning from meaning comes from i think a little 
of aspiring to do more than just simply existing so i think important in the construction of how we 
meaning in our lives to make that promotion of our subconscious aspirations to conscious ones to bring them in 
language from system one into system from just impulses below the surface to things that we think about and 
want this i would like to achieve this this is what would make me again you need to consciously 
saying constructing meaning for my life but need to be making some choices in some conscious way sc one 
and the other thing is i think that meaning should be thought of as requiring an engagement with possibility 
is that supposed to mean in some sense look every decision you make is an engagement with possibility by 
i simply mean if you choose to turn left rather than turn right you thought to yourself there were 
possibilities and this is what i did and this is what i for that matter just objects obeying the 
of physics in some sense can be engaging with possibilities a path that obeys newtons laws of physics is 
that disobey so in contrast with other possibilities sc morality doing the right thing is different than doing the 
thing okay but there is a difference here i think that the difference is that making a decision might 
be a matter of saying this particular action is the correct one the appropriate one it does not necessarily 
its correctness or appropriateness in virtue of its difference with the other ones the path that the planets obey 
the sun obeys laws of physics once you know that once you know that the path is the one 
obeys laws of physics you need to know anything about the other paths there are things you could say 
them but you need to know them the point of the path that you take is not that you 
these other paths the point of doing a moral action not made moral by the existence of immoral acts 
sc whereas i think that meaning is different meaning is about bringing into existence something that otherwise or naturally 
been there something that gains value exactly in virtue of its comparison to other possibilities bacteria have a meaning 
life but a human being who can say i could do this or i could do this other thing 
if i do anything this third thing would probably come and making conscious cognitive choices about which to do 
is what i would say is the origin of meaning whatever that meaning might be again it might just 
a mode of existence if you say i get meaning from being a dutiful well something that you have 
do gonna be difficulties right gonna be obstacles to being dutiful gonna be temptations to not being dutiful you 
get meaning out of life by being a devoted spouse right by not cheating on your loved one there 
be temptations that you overcome sc all sorts of ways in which you can bring something into existence that 
or naturally have been there it could be that you create a great work of art or a great 
discovery or you build a company and make a million dollars or you construct a monument it could be 
you have an experience or adventure or simply a life welllived but these are all things that you get 
for by making choices that brought them into existence the key to me in my mind you can disagree 
the key to in my mind to meaningfulness is the ability to be able to say it not for 
choices i made that would not have an option some sort of intentional cognitive deviation from the easiest most 
naturally available path where i think meaning comes from in some sense now the ways in which you are 
to deviate from the easiest possible path are up to you are going to be different and maybe being 
i really think that it is a mistake always mistake people make in this sure that i make it 
but to sort of project my favorite things to do and say that universal and everyone else would do 
right sc i mean academics do this all the time academics when they talk about a meaningful life academics 
people who like thinking about things and reading books and writing and creating works of pros and literature and 
very often what academics say is the place to get a meaningful life from from reading and learning and 
and those are perfectly good ways to get meaning in life from but not the only way so i 
try to avoid that nevertheless the one tiny sort of nontrivial substantive thing i will say is that if 
saying is correct that meaning is necessarily conscious and selfaware and that it results from an engagement with possibilities 
a comparison with what you did do with what you do then an extent certainly a sense in which 
aspirations lead to more meaningful lives right doing something that has a little bit more of a deviation from 
easiest possible path leads to more of a sense of accomplishment leads who are more meaningfulness and easier said 
done okay sc i mean sure you wanna say yes very interested in doing difficult things but all sorts 
different kinds of difficulties that we face in you might say going to the gym every day or a 
of times a week or whatever it is is difficult losing weight is yeah these are difficult in very 
of manifest ways by the way not equally difficult some people wait to go to the gym in that 
good for them but not necessarily something that have happened automatically not consciously bringing that meaningfulness in their life 
enjoying themselves for others a big struggle to go to the gym but what i wanna say is that 
are other ways in which things can be hard and thinking mostly of thinking thinking mostly of the search 
truth the search for what we believe to be correct about the world sc i had the podcast with 
blume where he had this book called against empathy and i get his point he was trying to say 
empathy is something that we naturally have for people like ourselves and that can be distortive because different than 
purely rational about morality and how we should behave in the world because a purely rational consideration give extra 
to people like ourselves so against empathy in that sense i think the right attitude to have toward empathy 
i think that sure easier to be empathetic for people like yourselves but not an argument against empathy an 
against doing empathy badly i think that in that a relationship between empathy and the search for truth which 
not that empathy gets in the way but then empathy is a crucial tool in searching for truth sc 
overwhelming temptation and this is especially true in people like me and people who are scienceoriented stem kind of 
logical thinkers people who like reason especially on the physics or engineering side of things we have a weakness 
simple explanations for cutting through the bullshit and finding the simple essence of things the spherical cows and a 
of times that involves paying attention to some things in the universe and not paying attention to others this 
a crucially useful technique in physics where galileo if following my videos the biggest ideas in the universe i 
an enormous credit to galileo for saying ignore air resistance and see what happens if we do crucially important 
physics but you need at the end of the day if you want to get an accurate view of 
world put the airy systems back in and i think that when saying let me back up a little 
as i mentioned the introduction saying this when the country around me the society around me is in a 
there are literally violent protests going on on the streets sc police brutality racism in addition to the fact 
a giant pandemic that is shutting down the whole world a tough time in a lot of ways and 
in tough times it becomes harder to think in subtle and nuanced and complex ways it becomes easier to 
for simple mottos and simple things to say because very sensibly anxious and sad and frustrated and angry and 
think correctly that this is just not a time for delicacy for taking other feelings into consideration gonna be 
people who see this or that piece of video and gonna see the people who they like or suspicious 
acting badly towards people they do like or sympathize with and they will say i was right all along 
you other people are to and tried to say that in such a way that it applies to a 
of different people sc and the complicating factor is that sometimes right right sometimes some groups really are being 
on by other people and just telling the truth but this is all to the direction of saying that 
you say that you get meaning out of doing something that is difficult that is not natural not obvious 
falling down the stairs that is actually something active and aspirational part of that is not just lifting up 
weights in some very direct physical way part of that is making the mental and emotional effort to understand 
world in as complicated and precise a way as possible and that includes understanding other people and not every 
officer is brutal and racist not every protester is violent and is looting and we need to part of 
struggle part of the difficult thing to do is to find the common ground not to let the real 
off the hook either part of the nuance part of the complication we can simultaneously say there are legitimate 
in our society that we need to work to fix and that not every person is participating in those 
and we have to make the effort to do that sc living in a world where things are going 
can be difficult like i keep saying it can be tiring and exhausting and if there is some lesson 
what been talking about here visavis the meaning of life that you give up anyway that if meaningfulness comes 
contemplating alternate possibilities in our lives and recognizing that something that we would like to be the case but 
happen automatically something that we need to work for and where meaningfulness comes from in our lives then it 
that there is some worthiness to doing that to continue to try look even if it work i tried 
be very clear that meaningfulness come necessarily from achieving something it comes from aspiring towards something sometimes cysiphists and 
gonna keep rolling down the hill other times we get to the top and we achieve mount everest you 
ahead of time often times but it can still be meaningful it can still be worth the effort very 
sc i wanna denigrate or dismiss the difficulty of the continuation of the struggle to make the world a 
place the biggest struggle there is but it matters worth continuing to try to do it again different people 
are gonna different ideas about what it means to struggle to make the world a better place okay but 
matters that we struggle it matters that we try it matters that we give up it is in some 
that what matters why our lives are not just surviving are not just existing persisting from daytoday a bacterium 
it can do only choices to try to keep living a human being has other choices more loftier choices 
meaningful things that it can try to do and i hope that despite everything in all the ways that 
world tries to run us down that we keep trying that we keep struggling that we keep trying to 
things better sc i think plenty of evidence that we are i see even as depressing as it is 
open up twitter and look at going on i see plenty of evidence of people doing inspirational things in 
to all the bad things a lot of good things going on out there a lot of room for 
gonna try i certainly do not think that achieved anything completely blameless laudable life trying to do better all 
time trying to understand what other people want to try to be more generous towards people who i disagree 
to try to split my time in the most useful way possible between doing things for me doing things 
my friends doing things for my family doing things for the rest of the world a complicated world out 
but the struggle matters it is what matters and i think that worth it it is meaningful keep it 
thanks music congrats on your episode although i wish the celebration were under better circumstances very clear thoughtprovoking and 
episode thank you i thought i was going to hear professor solo doctoral fellow for advanced research from snooty 
u this episode puts into stark relief the great communication style of sean carroll very approachable very wide ranging 
in an intelligible down to earth style that is the mark of a good teacher one of the most 
puzzles for philosophers and scientists is how did consciousness originate did it emerge from the complexity of the organization 
neurons or is there some other explanation the idea of panpsychism grew out of the realization that consciousness could 
have emerged solely from the material elements of the periodic table unless those elements had a spark of consciousness 
is an interesting idea but how would one test it another idea that is not particularly amenable to testing 
the idea of the logos which refers to words which are the outer manifestations of self consciousness max planck 
discoverer of quanta as he immersed himself in the developing theory of quantum mechanics said can never get behind 
if consciousness is not emergent but is the ground of all being another good book is demon in the 
paul davies thank you for the podcast looked forward to every monday since the first episode after one hundred 
my favorites not in order have to be roger penrose leonard susskind and daniel dennet i think it would 
cool to hear from brian cox about quantum mechanics or richard dawkins on evolution or related topics oooh or 
steven pinker on linguistics or consciousness no matter who you talk to i enjoy it thanks again happy centenary 
it still feels like a new podcast still the best cast on the web would still love to hear 
in depth discussion with you and david deutsch on many worlds and quantum computing thank you for one hundred 
podcasts sean please have more solo episodes in the next your email address will not be published required fields
