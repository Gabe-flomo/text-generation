host sean carroll and today we are talking about life maybe we always talk about life in some sense 
people who had on the mindscape podcast are living organisms themselves no one has yet noticed that any of 
guests have been chatbots or artificial intelligences but get deep a little bit here ask what is life what 
you mean by life sc this is the subject of astrobiology which apparently grew out of exobiology i really 
learned these vocabulary words i knew about the vocabulary words but i know about their relationship apparently we used 
use the word exobiology but exo means external right out there so life on other planets or other stellar 
or whatever so it excludes life here on earth but astrobiology despite the word astro being there is now 
to mean just the idea of life both on earth and outside sc so what do you mean when 
say life and basically two angles you can take one is you can look at actual life of course 
with life here on earth but okay it comes in various forms you can look at big organisms mammals 
insects or what have you you can look at little organisms algae and bacteria you can look at edge 
like viruses you could look at things that are not living but are complicated like chemical reaction networks and 
can try to draw some line and you can try to say this is what counts as life this 
what a whole another way of thinking about it which is just a backup to forget about the details 
chemicals and geology and going on here on earth or anywhere else in the universe and say do you 
by the idea of sc something to do with complex systems that can keep going people debate what life 
is maybe the processing of information is somehow very important here so guest sara imari walker is an expert 
both of these approaches both looking at actual life looking at the chemistry thinking about how the molecules fit 
to form the origin of life whether on here or on other planets and also the more information theoretic 
that tries to ask what kinds of structures would count as a living being even if they were made 
of completely different kinds of chemistry sc so be unsurprised to learn given those kind of interests that sara 
actually trained as a physicist before becoming a fullfledged astrobiologist so we have a wonderful conversation here words like 
and complexity appear but a fascinating topic going to be returning to it on other episodes in the year 
come how do you look for life elsewhere in the universe in our solar system what do you mean 
life could there be different forms of life here on earth could you make life in the laboratory i 
a very exciting frontier and this conversation is a wonderful introduction to some of the major ideas sc remember 
we have a website preposterousuniversecompodcast so forget you can go to that website and you can find complete transcripts 
every single episode so if something interesting that goes on that you hear in the episode you need to 
to the whole episode six months from now when you wanna catch what that thing was you can go 
the website and actually search for it those transcripts are paid for by patreon supporters so many thanks to 
and with that i think ready for some life talk so go music sc sara imari walker welcome to 
mindscape podcast sara imari walker hi happy to be here sc yeah great to have you here especially because 
keep having these people on the podcast who i just think are intrinsically interesting and then in the middle 
the conversation i realize they were trained as physicists at a young age and that includes you right sw 
sc so how did you get right now working on origin of life and a whole bunch of other 
maybe i wanna dive into the ideas but maybe to calibrate the audience why you tell them how you 
to point a from point b and vice versa sw sure how back in history do you want me 
go sc when you were an undergraduate or maybe say graduate school start with graduate school sw okay yeah 
so i started graduate school at dartmouth college and i wanted to be a cosmologist at the time or 
particle physics and so actually to understand that motivation i might have to go back a little earlier sc 
sw so what happened was i went to community college actually for my first two years of college and 
took a physics class and i became deeply infatuated with physics sc great sw okay so it does go 
in history sc also a great message to anyone listening at a local college or something like that sw 
yeah i think important to mention so it was quite funny so i was at a two year college 
i was walking around saying wanna be a theoretical physicist when i grow and everyone thought i had two 
but to me it was really important and i had some really supportive mentors there but i think what 
intrigued me about it what really motivated me to continue at university and then to go to grad school 
i was very interested in fundamental descriptions of nature and what reality was and the fact that mathematics could 
so much of reality and that humans were really good at doing that sw and so i actually literally 
the lecture where i got interested in physics in community college it was the first day and my physics 
was talking about magnetic monopoles and the fact that they exist but we predicted them and we were going 
to look for them and so that idea deeply intrigued me and so what i thought was i wanted 
be like the people that were predicting those things and going to look for them and so i had 
idea in mind that i wanted to do theoretical physics and theoretical physics was like particle physics and cosmology 
i went to undergrad at florida tech and i studied physics there and i worked in a lab that 
particle physics so i was working on some calibration of detectors for the cms experiment lhc and then i 
to grad school to do cosmology in particle physics i really wanted to do theory sw so what happened 
i got to grad school was i started working with marcelo gleiser who was my phd advisor and he 
spent most of his career working on early universe cosmology and i was very excited about that topic and 
to think about where does matter come from and reheating after inflation and so i just wanted to work 
him but he was starting to work on this thing called astrobiology and i was like is laughter sw 
so he explained to me about the origin of life field and that that there were these problems in 
of life and so i started working on a specific problem related to the origin of life which is 
the origin of homochirality so biomolecules in our bodies come in mirror image form so amino acids that are 
into proteins come in a lefthanded righthanded variety but proteins are only made of lefthanded amino acids and dna 
rna are composed of righthanded sugars even though you could have left or righthanded sugar bases so i sc 
that the general concept of left versus right is chirality sw chiral yeah so chiral actually literally means in 
and so actually really fun to give talks for the public and stuff you can actually wave your hands 
like sc your job yeah sw yeah so waving my hands now but obviously podcast audience see that but 
so that was a fun problem to work on because this questioning the origin of life about how life 
homochiral and what happened in the origin of life to actually break that symmetry so if you try to 
prebiotic synthesis which is basically making compounds without biology and making biomolecules get roughly equal mixtures of both the 
form so left and right sc so nonbiological chemistry gives you both sw yeah basically and so i was 
that problem but as a physicist would study so physicists get really excited about certain classes of problems as 
know being a physicist but maybe the audience know but a particular problem called the which we use to 
ferromagnets for example and you can talk about a spinup or a spindown system and symmetry breaking between spinup 
spindown you can do the same thing with left and righthanded and so i started studying symmetrybreaking processes in 
from the perspective of a physicist related to origins of life sw and so that was kind of a 
segue into the problem and it was quite interesting for me because i was working on that problem but 
was thinking about this deep motivation i had when i first started getting into physics about idolizing my heroes 
science like einstein fermi and dirac and these people that had these really deep thoughts about the structure of 
and advanced fundamental understanding of how we see the world and thinking about this origin of life problem and 
i was taught physics was these certain sets of problems but as i started to work on it more 
realized that we really understand the origin of life and we understand the questions and that maybe there was 
deep physics to be uncovered in life or in the origin of life that might actually explain it sw 
i had this transition point maybe three or four years into my phd where i started not becoming resistant 
working on origins of life as a fundamental problem and realized the actual reason i got into physics in 
first place was i wanted to contribute fundamental understanding and here was this place sort of like the wild 
of science where nobody knows going on and so you can actually be really creative in the ideas you 
to the field and there were very few theorists working on origins of life so i remember going to 
as a phd student and it would be one hundred people at the conference and all prebiotic chemists and 
theorists and nobody thinking very deeply about this issue of what life is and how we can try to 
new theory to try to understand the process of origins of life sc i think also for the people 
are not experts out there crucially important that origin of life research is not a mature field in the 
way that particle physics and cosmology are particle physics and cosmology we have what are literally called and correct 
tested them and trying hard to push beyond them but difficult even to get any experimental clue whereas in 
of life like chuckle sw yeah sc many different models none of them is standard sw exactly right and 
like that about that field so i love particle physics and i love all the things that have been 
but like somehow you wanna also be actively contributing to that so yeah so fun about the field but 
infuriating constantly not sure what the question to ask is let alone how to answer it sc right both 
have their downsides sw yeah sc the downside of particle physics and cosmology is hard to make true progress 
nature we understand it too much and in origin of life we understand it too little so hard sw 
right sc so what do you but then you got a phd you are a physicist but then now 
in a physics department sw right so when i left graduate school i went to work at georgia tech 
so part of my reason for doing that was i got a position there working in their center for 
evolution and they have a really a great group of researchers there focusing on origins of life from the 
side and so i thought i know much chemistry and much biochemistry amd so if i went there and 
some theoretical modeling that i would learn a lot about how chemists think about the problem and how people 
different disciplines think about the problem and that was incredibly helpful but i remember also thinking the whole sw 
i was doing these models for we had these simple models in chemistry for original of life processes and 
the idea is we wanna study where the evolution is leading to something lifelike but we know what life 
and so i started becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that i could do all of these modeling of 
of life without having any metrics of success and even any of the ways we think about origin of 
science are really far from what we would call sw so actually this huge gap in the field that 
have prebiotic chemistry which makes simple compounds like amino acids or rna nucleotides under prebiotic conditions so without biology 
you can only make the simple building blocks you make big molecules and you make anything as complex as 
cell obviously from such a simple condition or at least we yet presumably that happened at some point in 
past through some evolutionary process but the way prebiotic chemistry is now very focused on building specific components of 
systems and so far we can only get very simple ones under nonbiological conditions sc basically molecule by molecule 
by molecule by molecule so the standard of proof in that field right now is you make a molecule 
sc yup laughter sw without biology but you sc the gold standard is one that reproduces itself like overlapping 
sw well eventually but nowhere near that so right now a successful prebiotic synthesis experiment is you make a 
found in biology without biology sc okay sw and so my only point with that is useful to know 
conditions those molecules can be made under but not life sc a step sw and nowhere near life and 
on the other side of it we can trace back phylogenetically to try to reconstruct what we think the 
universal common ancestor of life on earth is so we have this idea that life evolved from a population 
cells with modern translation machinery so dna and proteins like we have today but when we try to look 
in history we get to a certain point where we call the last universal common ancestor and we go 
any further because before the original translation we reconstruct what happened we reconstruct what happened based on dna and 
dna being read out by the translation machinery to do so sort of been equated in my field to 
cmb of biology so like their surface of last that you actually push back with our standard way of 
at biological organisms sc it sounds like you were the only one who would make that comparison sw no 
the only one there are other physicists that make that comparison so i think i heard that one actually 
from nigel goldenfeld so another physicist working in astrobiology and physics of life stuff but anyway sc but maybe 
because i know that i used to get confused about this the difference between the first living organism and 
last universal common ancestor sw is potentially huge sc potentially huge in years in complexity and what does that 
sw in years and complexity and maybe scale like a spatial scale which we can talk about a little 
but so we know when life emerged we know where life emerged i think this idea that life emerged 
a single cellular entity on early earth and then it started reproducing itself and evolved to take over the 
but an alternative set of ideas that life emerged from geochemistry and with some organizing geochemical cycle it might 
actually been a planetary process from the start and i find those sets of ideas to be more intriguing 
what i mean about scale because you could think about an individual organism emerging and being alive or you 
think about emergence of life as this process happening on a planet and then individuals the things we call 
or units in biology emerge much later and sw so just to go back to where we were we 
come back to the set of ideas but i wanted to finish about the motivation so when i was 
georgia tech i was that gap just really bothered me and the fact that i feel like a lot 
people in origins of life field although been changing significantly over even my short career i think the field 
really starting to move in some new directions that are quite exciting for various reasons that i can talk 
but just to cut to the main point here that gap was bothering me and the fact that people 
the origin of life transition directly sc this is the gap between making a single molecule versus trace back 
the last common ancestor sw yeah versus having a complex functional minimal cell or an early living system versus 
molecules that are in that living system and the steps in between are like a black box sc a 
sw and they still are a black box we know what those steps are and so then i became 
interested in this is question how do we quantify it and then could we build theory for understanding the 
from nonlife to life what would that theory look like and how do we actually quantify this thing that 
call life so that we could actually build better origin of life experiments and so i ended up getting 
nasa fellowship and going to asu after georgia tech and when i got back more into physics thinking and 
that fellowship my mentor was paul davies and so what i worked on with him was really trying to 
about the origin of life transition more from the perspective of if we think that some interesting fundamental physics 
on there what is it and what would we say the origin of life transition is and so i 
up spending a lot of my postdoc thinking more like a philosopher i guess sc good yeah sw about 
i thought the origin of life was and so by the time i became a professor what i i 
this clear idea in mind of what i thought a concrete way of addressing the problem was and what 
with my research group is basically build infrastructure to try to build toward that theory and that takes a 
of forms a lot of ways to think about the problem and a lot of it is about the 
of information in physical reality i think that has a lot to do with what biology is which i 
explain more but most of it is just trying to understand what life is so that we can solve 
origin of life sc yeah definitely information theory and its role mostly what i wanna talk about but just 
something more concrete in our heads what are the theories for number one what the last universal common ancestor 
and number two what the first living organism is is there even a set of models that people argue 
or is it really just who knows sw no there are a set sc and when did they happen 
guess sw yeah so the origin of life itself i think is easier to talk about the different classes 
models because there are concrete camps so to speak where people have a particular idea in mind or a 
of hypotheses and actively working on that and so probably the most famous is the rna world hypothesis for 
origin of life which is that life started with rna as the primary biomolecule and sc maybe we should 
say what rna does in our present cell system yeah sw yeah so the reason for that yeah is 
rna is an intermediary between dna and protein so when dna gets translated or transcribed transcribed into rna and 
is read out by the translation machinery into proteins but rna also has this dual role where some rna 
fold and they have function on their own so it can both act as a genetic molecule and a 
molecule whereas in modern biology those rules are mostly split as dna being the informational molecule or genetic molecule 
proteins being the functional molecule that does stuff in the cell so the idea was if you wanted to 
a simple explanation for the origins of life and we know rna plays both these roles perhaps rna was 
first major biological macromolecule now even within the rna world though a very varying set of hypotheses about what 
rna world actually means so you could one extreme end of it is the rna world means that an 
molecule emerged on the early earth started copying itself and started evolving and then somehow evolved into all of 
rest of biology sc wrapped the cell around it yeah sw yeah and so that really relies very strongly 
evolution being a very strong force in nature to really generate novelty and complexity now on the other side 
it the softer rna world view which is just the idea that rna was the first genetic material and 
evolved later so you might have had some metabolism and some cellular structures before you even had rna but 
you got genetics it was rna sc so replication first versus metabolism first sw a little bit so get 
that sc those are the words heard why just trying to put my lesser knowledge to work sw no 
no good yeah but this is just thinking still genetics being important so actually because i tend to be 
the more metabolism camp if i was gonna selfidentify as a camp although i try to be as agnostic 
possible so i kind of wrapped that rna is the first genetic material into a metabolic narrative but some 
think that just purely think about the genetics so they make strong claims about rna being the very first 
thing but all they care about is being life is the first genetic things and then the rna world 
part of what are called genetics first hypothesis and the genetics first hypothesis just include rna as the first 
material but a whole variety of other nucleic acids that could have potentially preceded rna so things like tna 
pna and all these sc who knew yeah sw i know right and actually interesting people use these in 
biology and show that some of these xnas as called can be functional in modern cells but there are 
that work on trying to figure out which nucleic acid polymers can talk to each other the idea being 
you think about chemistry as hardware that you could have had a succession of hardware upgrades in some sense 
the genetic information and coding could have been in one molecule class and then copied to another and so 
copies to rna which is part of the central dogma biology that information flows from dna to rna but 
question of that idea of origin of life science is which polymers can copy information to each other and 
always bidirectional sw like sometimes you could get information transfer from one to the next but not backwards so 
whole research industry on that and then alternative to that is the metabolism first which is what you were 
to which is this idea that life started not with a molecule that could copy itself and undergo an 
process in the sense we would understand as being very darwinian where you have a genetic molecule that copies 
and has heredity and variation but some kind of selforganizing set of molecules which is we call in the 
are autocatalytic sets you have a bunch of molecules that catalyze a reaction and then those reactions form a 
cycle so the system as a whole reproduces itself sw and so the idea there is that there were 
autocatalytic chemical reaction networks of these reactions that actually emerged on early earth and varying sets of ideas there 
also so some people think would have early proteins would have been the best candidate for that so you 
have gotten some peptides so polymers and amino acids amino acids make proteins proteins are just very big long 
but if you think short amino acid sequences that could have catalyzed the production of other amino acid sequences 
would have got an autocatalytic cycle but other versions of autocatalytic cycles include things like a primitive metabolism sw 
a set of ideas that maybe the citric acid cycle which is a metabolic cycle that happens in modern 
is actually the most primitive metabolism and emerged from geochemical cycles and i find that set of ideas deeply 
for a number of reasons because trying to tie the origin of life to planetary processes and geochemistry and 
what notice and also i should mention in metabolism first there you get more emphasis on energy and thermodynamics 
those kind of approaches and in genetics approach is more focused on information and copying and evolution and both 
those things are obviously important in biology but been parsed out as separate to be origin of life hypothesis 
then other things like the cell first hypothesis that you might have just got lipid vesicles or something forming 
sc or cell walls that differentiate inside and outside sw yeah that and then molecules would have gotten inside 
and that would have started some copying and evolutionary process so a whole swath of different ideas and i 
you know what happens with each of these hypotheses is they have their own set of experiments that are 
to do but what ends up being hard about the whole enterprise is that i think a lot of 
ways that thinking about it are a very anthropocentric imposing things that are biological into chemistry in ways that 
almost anticipating this solution sc because we are poisoned by knowing what we do what life is now sw 
exactly so just to think about the idea i was talking about before about when a prebiotic chemist wants 
make a molecule in life they wanna do origin of life chemistry the way to do origin of life 
is to try to produce something like an amino acid under nonbiological conditions but we know that life started 
the chemistry that it has now there could have been lots of changes in the chemical structure of what 
living systems were using as they became alive and so i think it gets very hard to say if 
of these things are really in the right space of ideas sc well doing a good job of letting 
nonexperts know that it is a mess life right now has a lot of things going sw it sure 
sc and not even clear which of these are most important or could be first and then build upon 
a wonderful open field to play in but it can be hard to get a purchase on something different 
yeah right and i think part of the thing is the field has been really deeply focused on the 
of the historical origins of life and so what i mean by that is what we know is that 
origin of life happened once in the universe sc at least sw we think it happened on the at 
once yeah at least once thank you for clarifying that it happened at least once which is what i 
so we know for sure happened once we know if happened more than once sw and we think that 
on earth although people have alternative hypothesis it might have emerged somewhere else and then travelled to earth but 
to assume it happened on earth and then the historical origin of life problem is concerned with how did 
as we know it arise but you could ask the more general question about how does life arise in 
universe and then that necessarily need to assume the chemistry is the same and so the way you frame 
question and ask those questions is actually a little bit different than the way origin of life traditionally has 
posed and that way of asking it tends to border more with other fields like artificial life or start 
about what life could look like on other planets and i think actually much more fruitful personally but i 
a lot of growth in the field to really understand how to parcel all of those different ideas about 
to think about it sc and very natural once one has training as a physicist to try to say 
forget about life on this sw yes sc just imagine the idea of life sw i know i know 
and where it could have come from sw like you can take the girl out of cosmology but you 
the cosmologist out of the girl sc really true yeah sw i really just i i get that mindset 
i think i went into physics because i had that mindset in the first place sc yeah exactly right 
and so i do think that life is something that happens in our universe and there should be some 
framework for what life is and why it happens and i i well i know what i actually think 
i try not to have a firm opinion on these things because then difficult to make scientific progress i 
intrinsically hopeful that life exists in multiple places but i know for sure but scientifically i think the most 
hypothesis is that there are rules underlying the origin of life because that allows us to ask questions about 
those rules might be if life was such an odd statistical fluke that we really were the only life 
the universe then not a scientific question anymore in some senses sc then hard yeah sw yeah just so 
probability how would you actually get the principles out of it sc or even if there were one hundred 
times when life started but they were all different sw yes sc and that would be disappointing to our 
sw right but but actually i think interesting and one of the reasons that an astrobiologist rather than say 
biophysicist or theoretical biologist is that i think there is something about the way you ask about the question 
life astrobiologically actually quite useful in the sense that if i say gonna go look for life on other 
or i think there is this thing called life in the universe then i really am saying this objective 
that exists that we can call life and it should have some property common to all life and so 
the idea is what are those universal properties sc good sw the challenging thing is those may not be 
that we expect them to be so they might not be things like the molecules are always gonna be 
same sc yeah okay sw and so when the thing about the idea of information becomes more important to 
because i think that the physical stuff the molecules is always gonna be the same but what is gonna 
the same is that some informational process organizing matter and what life is and then that gets into a 
bunch of things about what does that actually mean and where stuck in this idea development of how do 
actually understand what this thing is sc it does but that sounded right there like you gave a definition 
life sw yeah sc i mean in my book big i quoted this definition that was offered by some 
panel of some sort sw oh right yes sc and i really like it at all it sw the 
life is a selfsustaining chemical system capable of darwinian evolution was that the one sc that was the one 
sw yeah the one yes sc and so i thought that that was just very blinkered and also the 
that life is capable of darwinian evolution in particular is certainly a historical fact about life but i could 
building a synthetic thing that we would all agree is living but is not capable of darwinian evolution it 
to miss the point sw yeah no definitely missed the point on a lot of things and one of 
even across life on earth darwinian evolution is not the only mode of evolution that we know exists so 
example the last universal common ancestor i was talking about horizontal gene transfer was really important so it was 
of a collective evolutionary process because individual units clearly defined sc yeah so back in the day that you 
pass genes back and forth to your friends not just to your children sw yeah exactly exactly and microorganisms 
do that still a really dominant mechanism of exchanging information even in modern systems and then you have things 
cultural evolution which is not necessarily darwinian and so we do know that biology uses a lot of different 
of changing over time and changing information over time besides darwinian and you can theorize about all kinds of 
ways evolution could work so one of them the darwinian evolution i think the part that actually bothers me 
about that definition and also about a lot of definitions of life is they assume life is chemical sc 
yeah sw and that chemistry needs to be in the definition of life and i think a major confusion 
chemistry which is the scale of physical reality talking like a physicist where life emerges and what life is 
i think chemistry is the scale where information becomes important as a part of physics i think it really 
at smaller scales in physical systems and i can talk about what i mean by information and chemistry in 
a minute but i think life is when i think about what life is i think about you and 
being life not just chemistry technological civilizations are life multicellular organisms are life so i think life emerges in 
but this process of information organizing matter as i was saying but it happens across many scales that sw 
part of interesting about life is life is actually like this hierarchically organized process so we talk about this 
in evolutionary biology of major transitions in evolution the first one was the origin of life but subsequent ones 
origin of multicellularity origin of social systems and all of that structure is still part of life but we 
talk about chemistry there and so i think actually really important and i think part of it is also 
idea that when talking about defining life we need to talk about an individual cell this is also something 
interesting to me because really fixated on this idea of the definition of life should describe an individual sw 
so one of my colleagues michael lachmann at the santa fe institute is really interesting the way he thinks 
it the way he thinks about a cell is a cell is a current manifestation of an evolutionary lineage 
you really separate the cell from the fact that it has this long evolutionary history so he would talk 
the unit of life actually being the lineage and i think a really nice idea but i also think 
you start thinking about expanding your definition of life that way that you really just isolate the lineage but 
need to think about all the lineages and so almost like we had an origin of life event and 
we talk about life the origin of life event and all the subsequent structure that emerged from that and 
information structure constantly constructing all of these individuals and all of these processes by having information distributed in space 
time and actually what life is sw and the natural boundary for that actually ends up being the planetary 
and so i think a lot about the biosphere as being as a whole as a proper unit of 
and then when we study the components of the biosphere partitioned into things we call individuals or societies or 
and those are all part of that living structure but you have to consider the whole thing sc right 
okay sw and a very different perspective than people usually take sc it is and so expanding the scope 
the thing both in space and in time right sw yeah sc so basically one life that we know 
sw this is why the origin of life is so hard because the origin of that process right sc 
sw yeah and so i think very much about this idea that some scale where this physics becomes important 
then what is that scale and that was part once you get the process of life going it is 
expansion process in space and time and building more structures like tables and microphones and things by information accumulated 
over evolutionary history but getting that process started is quite interesting and so one of the points i was 
about chemistry and why i think this physics emerges in chemistry and maybe not at lower scale so the 
life is always maybe gonna be happening in chemistry is that when you think about chemical space like the 
set of all possible molecules infinitely huge uncountably huge if you look at the largest pharmaceutical databases we have 
have millions of compounds and not even scratching the surface of the size of the number of compounds you 
make even with just a few elements sc and just combinatorial sw just combinatorial sc especially carbon molecules if 
just keep stringing them on there sw yeah a huge combinatorial space and so stuart kauffman has this idea 
talks all about the adjacent possible that once you get into molecular space like you have so many structures 
for a protein of possible molecules that not everyone could possibly exist within the lifetime or resources of the 
and so what happens in chemistry that at a certain scale is that not everything that could exist will 
exist and so to see something like a protein requires a lot of information to reproduce it in the 
reliably because otherwise it would just be a statistical improbable fluke and the same thing with the table and 
i think the process that we need to understand is how does information emerge or what is information and 
how does it make it so that things like cups and tables and very complex molecules are reproduced in 
universe reliably sc well clearly the idea of information is playing a huge role when sw yeah i know 
sc thinking about this already mentioned several times sw yeah i know sc maybe focus in on this a 
bit asking a lot here but is there a simple definition of what you mean by information and how 
it affect all these other things going on sw so i should say that obviously something called the information 
which people talk about quite a lot and was developed by claude shannon in the and a huge industry 
people that work on information theory and i use information theory a lot in my work but not exactly 
i mean when talking about information relevant to physics of life and so information theory will often talk about 
you have a quantity of information somehow related to your reduction and uncertainty about a process so if you 
into the room carrying an umbrella my uncertainty is maybe reduced about whether raining or not outside because you 
an umbrella and you were bringing it to work today so some information in the umbrella that i can 
about predicting what else is happening and so what people usually think about when they think about information sc 
shannon was interested literally in sending signals over wires sw yeah right sc and how to do that efficiently 
yeah very much about communication and a lot of caveats there about which might get more into the technical 
but it also requires that you have some way of encoding the message so it automatically assumes a lot 
things about what a physical system is to be able to communicate because it has to have a semantic 
or some kind of symbolic way of describing things that both the sender and receiver understand so that the 
can be decoded and so already a very large set of assumptions and i think whatever physics underlies information 
should be a property that drops out of the physics not something you impose on it and sc so 
it safe to compare this to my favorite example if i have a textbook that is written in french 
i speak french in some sense it convey any information to me sw exactly yeah yeah exactly right and 
chuckle and so the way people usually talk about information is within that formalization what interested in is the 
that there seem to be some processes that require some kind of abstraction or some kind of representation that 
necessarily tied to the physical substrate so an electron has charge and you remove the charge from the electron 
is a property of the electron but information is quite different in the sense that evian is that how 
pronounce this i never sc evian sw evian water bottle right so i can read evian and now i 
that word in my mind but existing on the water bottle which is one kind of physical material my 
is a different kind of physical material and then talking about it into this giant microphone which is really 
large and now traveling over wires and is now on computer that well in the future will be but 
now and their now are different sc yeah sw so information that can exist in a lot of different 
but somehow it still has the same property that it means the same thing in all of those different 
and a really intriguing property for something physical to have and so this gets into a lot of deep 
debates about how physical information actually is because it seems to be this abstract quantity or property that can 
in many different media it can be copied between media and it have the same physical oomph that something 
electric charge has although a little bit like energy we think about energy sc a little like energy i 
i think yeah sw yeah so energy is actually quite an abstract concept also but we have more concrete 
for understanding energy as a physical thing and i think information we my favorite example to use about why 
think information is really different in the kind of physics that it mediates is to actually think about examples 
technology very visceral so chemistry is hard because chemistry seems very abstract it happens inside ourselves we experience it 
our daily experience but i like to use this example of launching satellites into space and to think about 
as a physical process sw and so if you think about necessary for a planet like the earth to 
thousands of satellites orbiting it which we do although most of them are artificial we have one natural satellite 
then we have all these artificial satellites the artificial satellites are quite interesting because in order for them to 
there it requires that you have a technological civilization or some kind of intelligent process with knowledge of the 
of gravitation and engineering principles to actually build little metal boxes and throw them into space and that idea 
knowledge or information about regularities of the physical world and the ability to control them to mediate new physical 
like launching satellites into space that really intrigues me about information in order to get to that point you 
this long evolutionary history we had biological systems learning about physical reality or learning about their environment the way 
would talk about it and gradually acquired all of this information to the point that you had science emerge 
the planet and then learning about gravitation and formalizing it in mathematical laws and those mathematical laws are information 
they allow us to do these transformations in the physical world that be possible without that information sw and 
we david greenspan has this nice way of phrasing it that a planet antiaccreting matter sc yeah flinging matter 
around us sw flinging matter into space so planetary formation they talk about planets accreting to form so accreting 
and forming planets and then you might get a few satellites and then you have this weird kind of 
that has life on it and evolving over a long time doing all this weird stuff and then suddenly 
and i think a really nice example of the fact that that process just happen without certain kinds of 
in the system sw and i really like this quote that david deutsch has in one of his books 
i use almost all the time in my talks i love it so much but something like metals can 
transmuted to gold by the the processes that power stars and by intelligent beings that understand those processes and 
nothing else in the so there is something about intelligence as a physical process quite different because like physics 
and then you have biological or intelligent systems that understand physics and then they can make these transformations that 
not physically impossible not impossible to launch a satellite into space if you just had physics and chemistry and 
biology no organisms no evolutionary history acquiring information you would never see a planet launching satellites into space sc 
quite given a formal definition but it sounds like what matters to you about information is somehow a matter 
potential or ability or leverage you can somehow affect the world in a way because you have this information 
yeah right so sort of about the possibilities that i use the word causation a lot which people have 
problems and i have problems with it a little bit myself because kind of a loaded word but interesting 
me is what can happen causally in the universe and i think a lot of processes that can happen 
just and that what biology does is it somehow can cause things to happen that happen outside of the 
of process that biology is and you could call that thing causative information but somehow and so i think 
is a deep connection actually between information and causation sc back to philosophy again sw and now back to 
and a huge industry in complex systems trying to understand that deep connection and i think anybody i think 
lot of people have a lot of insights into it but we really understand it so i i think 
is information structuring matter what is information in some sense like causes that can be copied between physical systems 
yeah okay sw and so there is kind of a framework there but really funny every once in a 
i have with my research group i just like to pounce on them at group meeting have a is 
and everybody has to write on the board their definition of life and amazing how much it changes laughter 
but good i think productive it sc which happen in a particle physics group thing is the right all 
yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah so i think a lot of our challenges we have a really loose conceptual 
of what the right space is but how to actually penetrate it and build a rigorous theory and have 
experiments to test just really hard sc it sounds like this goes well beyond the question of origin of 
or the nature of life because as you mentioned there is something called information theory you can buy text 
called information theory but in some sense hinting that we are lacking a full theory of how information interacts 
the world or what information does we can quantify sw yes sc entropy and flow of information correlations but 
interface of maybe information and energy or information and work or something like that is fallow territory sw yeah 
i think very accurate i do think that there is a missing physics in some sense various people like 
describe it in different ways for me i think there have been major revolutions in physics and if gonna 
the next major one like quantum mechanics or general relativity was it would be somehow physics of information but 
bias obviously but poor hope sc yeah all gotta go out there with the view sw yeah we gotta 
for it but anyways i do think a fundamental property of our universe and pretty ubiquitous so it exists 
of life and it should tie into other ways we think about physics and exist in other physical systems 
i think interesting i make an analogy sometimes when thinking about gravity like gravity exists everywhere at least spacetime 
everywhere but sometimes if we wanna study gravity at its most extreme and we really wanna get insights into 
of spacetime and things we study things like black holes if you wanna understand information and how it operates 
the physical world i think you study something like a living system sc go to the limits of those 
yeah sw yeah because we are literally the things that exist where that physics is most evident sc right 
so does that kind of i guess i have two questions one do other people share this perspective and 
other one is are there tangible ways in which it might help us understand the origin of life sw 
i think other people do share the perspective not gonna say a majority view obviously and i tend to 
wanna work on majority views because i feel like sc oh yeah good sw more room sc other people 
that sw yeah exactly and also one of my goals actually thinking about the is question is i know 
right or not right and in some sense one of the ways i justify why i push so hard 
trying to really push the boundaries of how we think about that problem is just that i think that 
to be done and whether the way doing it is the right way or not is subject to discussion 
and scientific inquiry and validation against experiments once we can build the right theory but it also hopefully will 
people to just start getting out of our boxes and think about the problem differently which i just think 
desperately needed so i think what i do do in my work and something i think my group is 
good at i work with insanely talented grad students and postdocs but we always are trying to think about 
are the experiments and how do we actually connect to experiments or real data sets and so my hope 
that there will be in the same way that physics has really progressed because of the interface of theory 
experiment something that really needs to happen in origins of life and not in the i make a distinction 
modeling and theory in the sense that a sc okay what is that distinction sw the model is something 
like a particular system so i can build a mathematical model that will describe a particular enzyme and how 
functions or something but if you have a theory much more encompassing and explanatory and some sc hand model 
something like that yeah sw yeah exactly and theories are more predictive i think across different systems maybe just 
own personal classification but i purposefully make that kind of distinction because i think in origins of life had 
lot of modeling not like absent of theoreticians but we have any motivating theories really all those hypotheses very 
kind of model not talking about general principles so i really think of the rna world hypothesis is a 
principle for origins of life a very specific kind of set of idea that was designed to be experimentally 
and relate to life on earth but what i would really like to see the field move toward is 
theory for what we think life is and trying to test it by doing experiments that could test it 
looking or using searches for life on other planets as tests of hypotheses about what life is sc can 
give us an example of something that you would either do or advocate people doing in the lab to 
on these ideas sw yeah one of the things i think so been this kind of newer set of 
related to what is socalled in origins of life which is sc messy chemistry sw messy chemistry so people 
doing a lot of this kind of soup chemistry so a little bit like the millerurey experiment was done 
the and that it was famously produced amino acids from some guk but the idea is now to try 
have some simple building blocks but have them coupled maybe to an environmental source and also do multiple experiments 
my ideal scenario and actually i i work with experimentalists so one lab i work with is lee lab 
university of glasgow and they do these kind of experiments so been on some work with them on that 
they take these soup chemistries and they try to change the environment by having different minerals introduced to the 
as a function of changing the history of the chemistry or changing the ph and a lot of hydrating 
dehydrating and so you have these environmental cycles that you introduce to these messy chemistries and then what you 
is you get really different product distributions out of different histories but interesting is you never reproduce the same 
set of products but you do reproduce features so sc you sorry if you do the same experiment twice 
get different answers sw yeah because chemistry is stochastic sc okay so just random fluctuations sw right yeah and 
these are lots of different molecular species in the we were talking about before and then molecules can be 
active so they change the nature of the distribution and exactly the kind of dynamic you wanna get to 
right you want a changing history over time sc so the kind of early adopter effects so if one 
comes into existence early it can change the whole future progress sw it can change the whole future yeah 
and exactly what we wanna look for and amplify and understand the statistics over and so in some sense 
we need a statistical approach to chemistry in the same way that people took a statistical approach to understanding 
in the and things but how do you actually do statistics over chemistry really difficult because chemistry is quite 
sc but you can see where the information theory is coming in then sw yeah exactly yeah and so 
i and also sort of like physicists are obsessed with macro states and micro states and i like this 
starting to get into a macroscale view of chemistry you care about the specific details of the chemistry and 
history but maybe some macroscopic properties of the chemistry that are reproducible given a certain history and those might 
to specific features that are lifelike potentially sc do you think that the origin of and this is something 
can just have an opinion on and not necessarily something you have established but do you think that when 
started it required some leap some sort of very unlikely fluctuation or was it more or less inevitable given 
conditions sw i am not sure i get asked that question a lot and thought about it a lot 
i think i have a firm opinion one way or the other i think what i do think is 
some sense if we think the origin of life is a reproducible process that if you get the right 
it should happen but with the likelihood it would happen is still uncertain sc okay sw and so with 
kind of experiments one thing that i was describing that i like is being robotized so you can automate 
process and so i have in my mind this vision of a large scale origin of life experiment which 
have actually tried to get off the ground various times so been a lot of talk over many many 
about when cern finally shuts down maybe they allocate all those resources to origin of life stuff laughter sw 
my secret hope sc i think that planning to shut down in our lifetimes but yeah sw no no 
i think so either but i do know there have been several origin of life meetings at cern talking 
whether some of the resources from cern could be used for origin of life and whether that will ever 
happen or not is another thing but i do i think one of the things is right now the 
is as you were saying before in this very early stage of development and we have standard models and 
and so like every isolated lab has their pet theory working on and the experiments exploring one tiny regime 
chemical parameter space and one tiny set of conditions and imagine if we could get all those labs together 
build one massive experiment that was exploring the statistics over chemically possible when we start to get lifelike structures 
when we and what i like about that is because we know the probability of the origin of life 
could at least start to build experiments to bound it so we have for sc is it easy or 
it hard sw yeah so for example you have the super superkamiokande experiment which is trying to bound the 
decay and so every time we observe that event we know less likely so could you think about the 
of life that way and it would be a much more agnostic way of thinking about the physical process 
looking for things in chemistry to happen and trying to characterize them rather than imposing what you believe is 
origin of life story sc and probably orders of magnitude less funding for origin of life research than for 
sw yes yes yes sc is that just because the achievements have been less tangible so far sw i 
so and i think less convincing narratives sc okay sw to be honest because i think when you go 
all the different hypotheses people have they tend to be very disciplinarily divided and they tend to be not 
clear path set sc yeah okay sw lots of investment would be needed and this would really solve the 
and i think the challenge for the origin of life community is that we really do need to build 
convincing case if we are gonna solve the problem i think gonna have to be a massive international scale 
not a trivial problem to solve but we have in our mind that each little lab is gonna solve 
one little part and then suddenly the whole gonna come together and with the millerurey experiment it was almost 
the way the newspapers were talking about it they got amino acids in a couple of days and then 
had these pictures of aliens crawling out of the test tubes laughter sw and just sc well people were 
they sw they were excited i know of course sc that it is much harder to turn amino acids 
sw of course yeah sc than it is to make amino acids sw yeah and i think at the 
it was it was very revolutionary that that could even happen at all so then they thought maybe the 
steps should be as sc yeah sw but we found that to be the case and they might be 
might just be looking at the wrong conditions and maybe lab will just magically pop out some new alien 
form but i find that highly unlikely so i think there does need to be sort of a transition 
the field as far as how we frame the question how we think about the question how we collaborate 
make headway on the question and i think just not quite there yet sc is there any usefulness in 
replacing or augmenting these chemistry experiments with computer simulations or is it just the space of possibility is too 
sw my personal opinion on that is gonna be a little bit philosophical but i think there is something 
between simulator reality and real reality sc okay sw physical reality and i think if you wanna simulate things 
a computer fine but i think since we know the physics we actually have to do the experiments sc 
we know the standard model of particle physics sw we do sc we know how atoms behave sw we 
indeed but sc is that not enough you think sw no sc okay sw i think enough sc okay 
think this is where gonna diverge sw no i know sc we agree about everything else sw sure gonna 
on some things sc say it say it out loud do you really think that the core theory the 
model of particle physics is not up to the task of explaining life sw yes i do i sc 
in what way how could how can we change it or how do we look towards changing it sw 
i i think it operates at a certain scale of reality and really good at that scale and i 
that there are probably other kinds of physics that emerge at other scales like longer length scales longer time 
and really where the physics of information or whatever this thing is that talking about exists and somewhere in 
space and just not encapsulated in what we call the standard model sc so i know if you of 
the word emergence is something that people disagree about what it means just as much sw of course yeah 
information and things like that sw and so actually since you brought that up just mention sc good sw 
funny but at my group meeting yesterday we were just talking about all these words and everyone just wants 
throw away information complexity emergence and life and all these words are just so loaded and mean so sc 
consciousness and free sw yeah you sc and you might get me to sign on to this laughter sw 
yeah yeah well we also were talking about those and trying to throw them away and decisionmaking is another 
hard sc yeah sw so all yeah that concepts struggling with where people know what the words are sc 
there is a nice paper a classic paper by marc bedau about what he calls weak emergence versus strong 
other people have written about this too and basically his suggested delineation was properties at the higher scale are 
emergent if in principle you could put the microscopic theory on a computer and simulate it sw yes right 
and get the answer whereas strongly emergent if you can see them at the higher level but you could 
even simulate the thing if all you knew where the sw yeah sc laws and so a big believer 
weak emergence not in strong emergence but sw a big believer in strong emergence sc yeah there you go 
and part of my reason for that is the standard model is an equation written down by humans sc 
is sw and it emerged from human minds laughter sw and so i have so one of the thought 
so were all the other equations sw yeah i know exactly so i think something interesting we wanna try 
reduce biology to physics but physics is an emerging property of biology and i think actually deeply important and 
one of my favorite sets of thought experiments that i play around with now is to think about what 
is as a physical system sc cool sw and so a lot of people are interested in mathematical physics 
why is it that wigner had this unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics right and so we understand my math corresponds 
physical reality so well and then get people like max mathematical universe hypothesis just all math exists somewhere sc 
recent podcast cast max tegmark sw yes okay good there you go i can refer to that podcast and 
i like elegant but i think interesting to me to think about is to think about math as a 
of information and one that evolved out of biology and i think a really interesting microcosm of trying to 
the physics because i think the reason that we think that mathematics does work so well for us as 
language of science or physics is that the kind of information that is the most copyable between different physical 
so if i make a semantic statement you can misinterpret me been debating information for the last however long 
talking but if i make a mathematical statement you know exactly what i mean right and you could put 
in the computer the computer knows exactly what it means right so there is sort of a different quality 
transferring information between physical systems in mathematics than in semantic language or in any other kind of way that 
might have abstractions that represent information and i think one of the reasons that mathematics works so well of 
physical reality is because this abstraction that our human minds have evolved really good at being represented in different 
and also probably in some way why we get dualities in physics why one kind of physical reality looks 
same mathematically as another kind of physical reality sc so some kind of bias because able to look at 
things in certain ways sw yeah yeah and so i think you can make those kinda arguments about the 
model but always intrigued by this idea that the standard model is effectively a core screening that made of 
regularities seen in the world and is effective description that works really well but a physical system that made 
model sc yup sw and we use that model sc some of my best friends were involved in it 
sw i know and we made that model to and we use that model to build giant detectors that 
probe the smallest scales of physical reality right but in order to get to that loop you had to 
through a system to even be able to construct that and i think that loop is really deeply intriguing 
there is some physics that describes that loop not encoded in physics as we know it because we have 
it is actually in some ways deeply related to the problem of the observer in physics right we know 
to put the observer into physics sc yeah all this reflection selfawareness sw yeah sc recursion i guess is 
word looking for sw yeah and i think why so hard because we know how to reason about ourselves 
sc well what you had this definition of life maybe you claim it was a definition but this way 
looking at life is something that uses information to manipulate matter can i ask where the information comes from 
do you have a picture of the universe starting with a lot of information and life learning to take 
of it or is information created in the process of life coming to existence sw i think created with 
in some sense i think the physics is there but i think biology is accumulating or generating information and 
some sense if you wanted to go to a shannonesque definition sort of like the exclusion of possibility is 
table exists so it has a lot of information in it because if you wanna think about all the 
configurations that could be this table most of them are not this table sc okay sw so to make 
this table it requires a lot of information so if you wanted to go to the traditional physicist narrative 
can think about that and that biology is basically storing the information specific to a table sc but wait 
wait lost sw or generating the information specific to a table sc yeah why i wanna know the difference 
was it there and we organized it so in your view is information conserved sw debated this a lot 
you know who asked me this question all the time is paul davies actually like always sc physicist yeah 
yeah another physicist i know sc okay sw deeply intrigued by that question i am deeply mystified by it 
i think one of the questions i keep going back to a lot of things i kind of i 
which side of it on and one of them is precisely your question about whether the origin of life 
the origin of information or if information preceded life sc i bet a sense in which both of those 
true right sw yeah probably sc different senses of the word information sw yeah yeah yeah and i think 
sc and so this is a way to trip ourselves out sw yeah and i think also hard about 
in new conceptual spaces because when i use the word even i use it in different ways so i 
like when trying to build a theory you have many ideas of the theory in mind and conceptually related 
not all identical and then where you are in the space of ideas at any given time shifts and 
think healthy for developing new ideas but very hard to describe like you say something concrete about some of 
and you could be on both sides that seem like they disagree with each other because sc well why 
spin it as saying that you know to the young people out there listening who might decide to be 
origin of life information theory researchers there is a lot of possibilities there are a lot of possibilities out 
there are interesting ideas sw a lot of scope for creativity sc questions that are easy to ask and 
to answer sw yes yes i think hard to ask the right question sc right sw and then when 
ask the right question it might be easy to answer so i would actually click you sc yeah okay 
true also true so easy to ask some questions hard to ask the right question sw yes yeah yeah 
the situation sw and i think where a lot of the creativity is like do you know which question 
sc okay so let me rephrase the angle been getting at maybe in a different way is there something 
information that thinking about information has brought to the table already that has been very helpful in understanding how 
comes to be or is it more an aspiration sw i think an aspiration but i think the a 
of helpful things about the dialogue as far as reframing how we think about the life problem that i 
really useful and i think should be useful to the community independent of whether they think information is the 
way of thinking about it one is that life should be quantifiable in some way that there is a 
of life and not a black or white criteria that the not alive the alive but there might be 
of like a scale of life like this more alive than that system because more of a manifestation of 
physics in the same sense you have deeper gravitational potential wells or something right so there should be some 
of objective property it might be a high dimensional space of objective properties right life is a complex system 
so we might just need to figure out all the parameters that we need to measure to say something 
but at least this idea that life has universal properties and ones that could be formalized in a quantitative 
sc and i like dare not to interrupt sw yeah sc you sort of made this point that if 
ever went to another planet and found an artificial satellite circling it we would not have found life but 
would know there was life down there sw yeah yeah sc right it have just happened sw yeah exactly 
sc so somehow there can be the impact of life on the sw exactly sc can be something that 
hand in hand with life without being life sw right right exactly so i do think that life has 
indelible imprint on the universe in the sense that it actually generates things that would be impossible without that 
of process sc and i guess what getting at is that we would like to be able to know 
to quantify that or to know it when we see it sw yes exactly exactly so one another one 
that life is not we have this idea of life being chemical and we need to define it in 
of individual units like a cell is the fundamental unit of life but that it could be more about 
process that occurs over space and time and much more of like this whole field of openended evolution that 
wants to understand what kind of processes can generate structure indefinitely right sc okay sw as an open ended 
and so you might think about life just as that process sc you mean outside of specifically darwinian biological 
sw yeah just yeah what is openended evolution does it actually exist in our physical universe those are interesting 
to ask because there could be physical bounds on how much intelligence technology could do or how much biology 
do we have this idea that biology generates novelty or technology generates novelty and there might be physical bounds 
that process and so does it continue indefinitely and how openended actually is it but just to bring in 
separate set of ideas to the mix but just the idea that life is not necessarily bounded in the 
structures we observe and there could be something hidden underneath that in the so interesting to me that people 
life is gonna have this definition obvious based on the physical structures we see sw it reminds me a 
bit of like when people are trying to describe planetary orbits with epicycles so like you have these models 
are just very obvious based on what you actually see but completely unexplanatory or predictive and then it took 
long time and a lot of deep intuition and deep thinking for einstein eventually to come up with this 
of the curvature of spacetime underlying gravity and that is deeply unintuitive not like i sit here feeling like 
in a spacetime manifold and curved right now so i think to think that the physics of life have 
equally odd and interesting underlying it is something really hindered the creativity of the human mind to really approach 
problem sc do you think we could be living in a simulation sw potentially but i think that kind 
think it misguides thinking right so i think one of the things interesting for me is that we take 
for granted in the sense that we think computation can happen in any physical system and equally equivalent and 
think that there is something about some physical systems can do some computations and some physical systems can do 
so i think that computation like in the same way i think mathematics is abstract and exists autonomous to 
reality i think computation is either and so i think you could ask it for a simulation but i 
simulations have to be instantiated and the properties of that physical media actually matter so the idea of stimulating 
universes i think would still ultimately have hallmarks of whatever physical system underlied that somewhere it make sense sc 
i thought that where gonna go is you know once you sw and not sure life can exist in 
computer i guess from that perspective sc well where i was gonna go because you were talking about the 
ways that life could be and i was gonna ask whether we could make it purely virtually whether that 
count in some sense sw well so i think it would count you could make a projection of life 
a computer but i think it would be quite the same as life in chemistry but it would probably 
be life so in the same sense that i think the table and the microphone are examples of life 
because they were created by living organisms sw yeah and so michael lachmann and i wrote this essay for 
about the distinction between life and alive and life was supposed to be objects things like microphones and tables 
chalkboards and things that require an evolutionary process to create them but things that are alive might be qualitative 
because the things that actually actively can construct those kind of things and so i think making those kind 
distinctions can be quite important as far as how we think about it totally forgotten my train of thoughts 
sc so if you if we agree that some aspect of life is using information to manipulate matter then 
if the life is just in a computer not doing that sw yeah oh okay yeah no and true 
it is in the sense that electrons are moving around the computer and what i mean about it being 
flat projection of it so separated what looking at from the simulation from its physical implementation that i think 
what the actual physics is sc yeah okay sw and so why i favor trying to think about chemistry 
an informational perspective than thinking about chemistry as a substrate of information because i can think about the physics 
life at any scale of biology but the thing nice about chemistry is like the base level of biological 
so the easiest to see the physics clearly so when i talk about biology creates biology uses information to 
things that exist otherwise in the absence of information when i talk about that with a molecule very clear 
to think about that a sc the capacities and how they interact sw yeah yeah and the fact that 
space is huge but i can actually count that space right like the space of possible tables i even 
what the objects are right so i think chemistry is a good microcosm for studying physics of life from 
perspective and so when i study biochemistry we do a lot of work in my group studying statistical regularities 
biochemistry trying to understand biochemistry from a statistical perspective what distinguishes the ensemble of living chemistries from nonliving chemistries 
the way i think about that is like part of like although just looking at chemistry the chemistry that 
has is shaped by all of those higher scales right sw so actually the physics at the base level 
it has the imprint of all the information of the higher scales and one way to think about that 
just to think about what is the chemical space that technology has opened up for example and in order 
get to technological chemical space like pharmaceutical drugs and the kind of things that doing in chemical space now 
an industrial civilization you had to go through billions of years of evolutionary process laughter and invent chemistry and 
right sw to get there so there is this kind of interesting thing where life emerges from chemistry but 
you wanna talk about quantum physics and stuff it takes billions of years for life to invent quantum mechanics 
then life can actually impact the quantum scale by building quantum experiments and things so not life can potentially 
any scale of physical reality but emerges in chemistry and i think trying to understand where that imprint is 
chemistry how many orders of hierarchy like multicellularity technology social systems and what their capacity is of all that 
to then expand the space even further quite interesting sc and all just different ways to use the information 
sw yeah yeah sc and that is clearly a sort of unifying thread sw yeah a unifying thread through 
i think and do but i think but the problem is that question is so hard to get at 
have to look at where can you actually make the traction on it and so one place where i 
like really concrete ways of trying to get at that physics and at least see parts of that physics 
so maybe to bring it home we can think a little bit more pragmatically about exobiology right sw sure 
sc for one thing do you think life out there elsewhere in the universe i mean kind of your 
to i guess it would be weird if you said no sw yeah so yeah i yeah no it 
would be very weird so i a very optimistic person in general just my personality so very hopeful there 
life out there i think that we know enough about what life is though and so i make a 
statement one way or the other and i think one of the things you know astrobiologists have a tendency 
wanna state the odds of life so often see headlines like more exoplanets with water discovered the likelihood of 
in the universe has increased laughter and like have a chance that any of these exoplanets has life on 
but actually we have a clue right and i and i think just being very brutally honest about that 
actually more constructive because you frame the way you do the science differently than if you assume a probability 
so i try i hope life is out there but i have any assumptions about what it is or 
it looks like i just wanna discover that physics and so one way i think about the search for 
on other planets that maybe is a little bit different than other i actually really wanna use the search 
life to at least bound the probability of life and so i think the planets we find life on 
equally informative to the ones that we might find it right at again it goes back to bounding the 
sc no results are some of the most important ones sw yeah sc yeah sw and so sc the 
experiment sw yeah yeah exactly so again the history of physics teaches us sc yes laughter sw so biased 
funny laughter sw sc in a safe space for being biased in that direction okay sw yeah i know 
well i think as long as and like the way i use it is like a narrative about how 
progressed and i think some aspects of that narrative are really powerful for thinking about how science is gonna 
in the future and i think talking about the history of physics physics has been really successful in telling 
about a lot of reality and like trying to learn from that history to project how we should think 
other problems that physics really made traction on yet is really useful so so i am obviously biased as 
physicist to like those things but i also think a useful lens for thinking about where we are in 
context of the history of science sc do you have a favorite resolution for why we have not yet 
life out there in the universe sw yes i i think we just do not know what looking for 
okay sw i really do and i i think really interesting sc you think it could be out there 
over the place sw potentially yeah sc yeah potentially sw so one i think a lot about life as 
planetary scale phenomena so i think life is deeply coupled to planets and like evolution has been completely dependent 
a planet on life and you really decouple the history actually people and that model exoplanets have a really 
time modeling earth without life we just know what it would look like and and part of that is 
biology has controlled a lot of geochemical cycles obviously the oxygen our atmosphere was controlled by biology and so 
sorts of things about this planet including modern climate change are dictated by biology sc and bracketed by venus 
mars which are completely different from each other sw yeah yeah completely different yeah sc right so a warning 
right and yes exactly so you and then you get titan which is a moon of saturn that we 
have a mission now dragonfly that gonna send to titan but titan could be alive but as a moon 
it have it maybe if you think about life as a planetary scale process or some kind of chemical 
and something happening kind of like almost life but maybe it make the transition to cellular life in the 
of open evolution we have then maybe titan could be alive totally wildly sc yeah no okay right sw 
to make an example but i think that those are the kind of things that we looked for or 
about sc and europa and enceladus could be alive yeah sw yeah yeah yeah so i i think lots 
of potential that life could sc i like how you very specifically say be not harbor chuckle sw yes 
yes yeah yes i yeah sc but let me just get your professional opinions on some of the other 
right sw sure sc an option that says that singlecell life is easy and multiplecell life is hard an 
that says once you become intelligent you kill yourself off an option that says even multicellular life usually become 
underwater or something like that your feelings about any of these sw i i think it is the case 
life appears to have gone through several bottlenecks that are very rare and unlikely events because they happened once 
the history of our planet but i think also a matter of scale again so interesting so they may 
rare they may be common we really reason effectively about that but one of the ways that i like 
think about it that i think challenges some of the ways that we even have that discussion is to 
had one biosphere been evolving for four billion years and had certain things happen in its evolution but the 
as a whole is a system and we really think about that as an evolving system because not a 
system but it is an evolving system sc changing in that sense yeah sw it is changing yeah and 
some sense the biosphere could reproduce itself but in order to reproduce it would have to emerge a technological 
that moved offplanet and terraformed another planet to look exactly like our planet and then you could think about 
as a whole reproducing themselves sc i like that yeah sw which is kind of a crazy idea but 
is the way a planet could reproduce right so i think a lot of the way that we frame 
kind of arguments and discussion are based on certain assumptions we have about what life is and what scale 
operates and i think we just know enough about those things so what i try to do is just 
where are the challenges to that framework and then how can we play with it but i have a 
answer about how i think about it people make the argument like eukaryogenesis for example happened once in the 
of our planet and that led to complex life so complex sc getting a sw yeah sc a nucleus 
a cell sw yeah a nucleus in a cell so we have three domains of life archaea bacteria and 
and the standard model chuckle so to speak of the origin of the eukaryotic cell is that an archaea 
a bacteria merged and formed the eukaryotic cell and as far as we know that happened once and so 
event is perceived to be very rare but multicellularity actually emerged multiple times independently and so people make the 
that could be more common but it could be that these things are predisposed based on the biological architectures 
we had before so you had a completely different origin of life with a completely different chemical you know 
structure it might have very different transitions sc yeah sw and so i think not at the stage where 
can really reason about that effectively sc do any of these considerations have practical implications for how we search 
life elsewhere sw i think they do so one of the things that been doing a lot in the 
few years is starting to work more on exoplanet science but thinking more about how can we frame the 
of life detection in sort of a statistical framework and so been really advocating for more using statistical methods 
basing inference to try to infer the presence of life and try to construct probability distributions for what our 
are and actually do it more as an inference problem and i think a more fruitful way of doing 
than saying we found oxygen and methane we have a disequilibria and so i so the starting to actually 
to build structures to try to combine multiple lines of evidence and try to develop statistical frameworks for life 
and i think a really important avenue of future progress and one of the things that been doing personally 
my group is working on network theory of planetary atmosphere so we do network theory to characterize statistical properties 
biochemistry but you can also do the same thing for planetary chemistry or atmospheric chemistry and we have sort 
a running hypothesis that atmospheric chemistry will have different patterns in the molecules and the reactions used than nonliving 
will and that we might be able to get some insights about life detection from that perspective sc now 
in the big data era of exoplanet science sw big data yeah exactly right chuckle sc yeah sw and 
hoping is that more of the way that biosignatures for exoplanets or even biosignatures in the solar system are 
and thought about is more moving toward big data approaches and trying to use statistical tools to infer that 
is present or not sc alright well if we find it you promise to come back on the podcast 
about it sw i will indeed do that sc carve out an hour and a sw yes sc okay 
good alright sara imari walker thanks so much for being on the podcast sw thanks that was great music 
podcast episode of low bar i know but i did at least listen to the dennett episode dr idea 
there is in the form of an informationtype theory is something that heard carlo rovelli also say although his 
is quantum gravity thermodynamics very interesting i wonder if dr walker has betrayed the fact that she leans more 
emergence when she says that artificial satellites stem from kind of intelligent process with knowledge of the laws of 
and engineering because those laws themselves produced our natural satellite which preceded our artificial ones i also love the 
of life as a planetary process and i wonder if maybe the simplest definition of life might be emergent 
and by emergent i mean it would be cheating to go backwards in complexity such that lesscomplex entropy pumps 
by more complex pumps would violate the definition so fun cheers all oooh i also love the discussion on 
vs information eg when dr walker says semantic representation or some kind of symbolic way of describing things that 
the sender and receiver i tend to think of meaning as a relativistic form of information again so fun 
content but intense to listen to re delivery speed and interaction with interviewer a minor correction to the transcript 
the paper sean refers to is by mark bedau not marc vidal available in full on site httpwwwreededumab if 
in further reading quite an interesting topic which comes up in a few podcasts eg the david chalmers episode 
worth a look correct that thanks please consider summarizing your main ideas and perhaps reflecting on the implications of 
ideas at the end of each podcast pingback writing as a pzombie efrens blog very good podcast i would 
that dr sara walker lay off the caffeine the rate at which she speaks is off the richter scale 
biggy i just listen again pause the and catch up and ponder the ideas loved it i loved this 
the question of whether some notion of can refer to abstract things like societies and processes in addition to 
individual biological units that create those things is so interesting and makes so much sense as all of us 
made of smaller biological units working together to create an abstract thing and we count as life could a 
inside a car be thought of as its own form of life with the person as the brainnucleuscontrol center 
a house people are living in its own quasialive thing as a structure with organized insides a regulated internal 
and different processes and routines like dishes and laundry that are carried out by agents inside of it a 
reason or have goals true but surely still meaningful to consider that when you try to design the perfect 
for a living thing to live you end up with something that has so many parallels to life itself 
organization processes etc completely unintentionally is a highway a kind of abstract bloodstream that supplies material to buildings as 
carry on with their internal processes if all of the dishes in a house break new dishes are needed 
the dishesprocess to continue i wonder if meaningful that life can often create structures that itself in terms of 
organized and having processes in a lifelike way which then in turn do the same thing a cell is 
organized and has processes it contributes to a person internally organized and has processes a person contributes to a 
internally organized and has processes the house contributes to a country internally organized and has processes etc electrons and 
and such are distinctly not alive and they will happily build structures all day that have no obvious that 
to the structure being made out of packets of charge and so on maybe quantum mechanics can be so 
people precisely because so conditioned to understand complex structures made by living things that when the telltale signs there 
we know looking for telltale signs or not we do know that out of our element on the subject 
planets and moons and such being alive i think really cool to consider that earth as a planet has 
outer membrane a fluid inside warmer than its environment and something that sure is shaped like an inner nucleus 
could be a way to expel waste products have we ever looked for organelles inside earth do we know 
not a big singlecelled organism we have gut bacteria and things living on our skin not uncommon at all 
life to provide shelter for other life i wonder if ever find magma whales or some kind of symbiotic 
that lives inside the earth maybe this line of thinking useful for considering how the world works but happily 
a cool science fiction story about a planet that did work like that by far one of my favorite 
of yours listening to her speak incites a flurry of crossdisciplinary ideas in my head also it should be 
kauffman instead of stewart copen cheers fixed thanks my favorite idea was the concept of biospheres reproducing by generating 
advanced beings to develop the ability to migrate beyond the biosphere and alter other planets to allow their own 
of life to exist on the surface it makes the idea of terraforming other worlds such as mars feel 
of an extreme option rather one that is essentially an inevitable result of a fully mature biosphere in planet 
sky my rock opera and podcast the character serves as the voice and intelligence of a biosphere married to 
serves as the body and to some extent soul of the union there is an implicit tragedy due to 
inability of the union to be sustained long enough to permit an advanced species to evolve and emigrate off 
what i failed to consider is why they planet and sky should care idea makes it clear they are 
they can reproduce if interested please have a listen to the podcastalbum at planetandskycom and please let me know 
you think walker not parker argh i found this very stimulating and informative which i seldom say about people 
about origin of life i thought sara had an amazingly open attitude and willingness to say words we often 
from male scientists some great perspectives here to my mind the fundamental problem with rna world and replication first 
is feedstock nucleotides just spontaneously form from random environmental bucket chemistry it takes several specific chemical pathways to produce 
sugar and an aminoacid and a phosphate anion and they easily coexist and to get sustained replication you need 
constant feedstock of building blocks rna seems like a phase life might have gone through but only in an 
that churn out building block molecules and turn them into nucleotides that environment is metabolism the idea that planetary 
processes define life rather than individuals is intriguing the downside of the liberal ideology whether classical or social or 
is that it too easily falls prey to sophistry it sees the individual in isolation sean used to have 
twitter bio that read the blind guys had just compared notes they have quickly figured out it was a 
is a social activity all humans are social with very few exceptions sociality defines our psychology not the other 
around the idea that bacteria exchanging genetic material between cells and across communities is familiar from lynn margulis who 
made the point that since all bacteria can in principle exchange bacteria with all other bacteria they are all 
species a bit surprised to find that gene transfer is not considered darwinian evolution though natural selection is still 
work it and finally argument for strong emergence was a humdinger the standard model was written down by humans 
and physics emerged from human minds is an emergent property of hell yes so it seems that we might
