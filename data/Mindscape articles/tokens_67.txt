your host sean carroll and today gonna talk about a topic that no one has ever really disagreed about 
which is the relationship of science and religion actually just kidding just have to say that the internet right 
sarcasm people have disagreed about this before in fact people have very strong opinions about it so sure the 
who listen to the episode will bring those opinions to the experience the person talking to is alan lightman 
professor of writing at mit alan of uniquely positioned to think about these kinds of issues because he was 
successful professional physicist who transitioned into being a successful writer and professor of writing you may know him from 
very famous and celebrated book dreams which was a novel in the form of a number of different scenarios 
albert einstein might have been thinking about when he was inventing the theory of relativity say for sake of 
that you believe in god or the supernatural is there still a place for talking about transcendence the sacred 
meaning in life some of the above but not all guest alan lightman brings a unique perspective to these

a successful example of someone who has mastered both sciences and the humanities and actually in this discussion i 
safe to say we disagree that much little tiny differences of emphasis here and there but both naturalists were 
atheists and we want to be firm about that but also to carve out some space for talking about 
where you might feel connected to the universe experiences of transcendence and meaningfulness and so forth without saying that 
are evidence of anything supernatural whatsoever but how should we think about these what should we say about them 
can we talk about them and also how should we talk to people who have different points of view 
we do about the existence of supernatural stuff whether god or spirits or anything else sc i think both 
i are generally pretty polite conciliatory kind of people we want everyone just to get along and lots of 
out there who are not of that cast of mind so i tried my best to find some little 
of disagreement here and there but mostly we agree i think that everyone including myself will disagree a little 
even with things i said because my mind changes about this but a great starting point for thinking carefully 
how to be secular atheist scientific in a world where most people are still believing in other things sc 
a great conversation i hope you enjoy it let me also say as usual welcome to go to the 
preposterousuniversecompodcast and support mindscape through patreon for recurring donations or paypal for one at a time donations i should 
by the way for the paypal donations for people who have donated money over paypal i have any easy 
to thank you on patreon we have the ask me anythings every month if a patreon supporter and i 
say thanks there in the comments and so forth so just let me say right here let me take 
opportunity to give my great appreciation for everyone who has supported the podcast over paypal i really do appreciate 
it helps keep the podcast going helps keeping me energized and with that go music sc alan lightman welcome 
the mindscape podcast alan lightman nice to be with you sean sc so i like to have a variety 
guests on the podcast and a physicist so of course perhaps an overabundance of physicists represented compared to the 
intellectual landscape but a physicist but who has an interesting career tell us about how you started as a 
and moved into other things al well i was interested in both the sciences and the arts from a 
age on the science side i did homemade science projects i built rockets and remote control devices and things 
a lot of budding scientists do i also like to write poetry and short stories and read a lot 
so i had this dual interest in the sciences and the arts from young age i have any too 
role models of people who became both scientists and writers but i did realize that i should get myself 
grounded as a scientist first before i began forays into the nether world of the arts i knew of 
few scientists who had later in life became writers like cp snow but i know of any writers who 
later life became scientists sc have you subsequently learned of any al i have not learned of any yet 
alright al if you know any let me know sc well a challenge for the young people out there 
right so it appears that science is a young game especially in physics the greatest accomplishments in physics have 
one done by people who are younger so i decided that i would get myself well established and rolling 
physics first so i got my undergraduate and graduate degrees in physics but i continued writing on the weekends 
evenings and then i would say around in my early or i began spending more time with my writing 
by the time i was my research career in physics was beginning to slow down a bit and i 
putting more time into my writing i had been on the faculty of harvard and then at some point 
moved to the faculty of mit where i actually had a joint professorship in both the sciences and the 
or the arts sc which is a weird thing how did you ever convince them to even offer you 
a thing and universities are a little bit sticky about this kind of procedure al well i talked to 
both in the physics department and in the writing department at that time it was part of the humanities 
at mit and i know how i convinced them i guess i must have hoodwinked them in some fashion 
i had a little bit to show for myself i suppose a physicist and a writer at that point 
would have been around about thirty years ago and i was very fortunate that they were willing to consider 
odd appointment sc and i think safe to say that your breakthrough was the novel dreams which remains a 
remarkable accomplishment in many ways tell us just a very little bit about what that book is and how 
the world you came to have that concept for a novel al well the novel is a bunch of 
vignettes and each one is a fictional dream that einstein might have had as he was working his way 
his theory of relativity which is a theory of time and in each chapter einstein tries on a different 
of time and one world time moves backwards and another one it moves in a circle and another people 
their past some of them are more physical and some are more psychological i think the idea occurred to 
partly because always been interested in the tension between our scientific side and our artistic side and that represented 
einstein as the representing the scientific rational side and our dreams representing our more intuitive artistic side that was 
theme i have always loved the magic realist writers like borges and gabriel garcía márquez and italo calvino sc 
al and those writers were i think influential on me as well sc was there ever a time in 
conception of that book when you thought it was gonna be a nonfiction book more straightforward overlapping conversation al 
it was always going to be a fiction book and not only that but as i conceived of each 
of the thirty dream worlds in the book corresponds to the actual theory of relativity and all the other 
are totally made up and do not correspond to physical reality at all but when i was conceiving and 
each of the dream worlds there was a temptation to try to make it scientifically plausible and i resisted 
temptation because i thought it would weigh down the book sc right welcome not to answer this question but 
you were writing it were you thinking to yourself i got something good on my hands or were you 
my god people are gonna think al no i think of any of those things when i began writing 
book it was like i went into a dream myself it was an incredible incredibly intense experience where for 
first three or four months i was just living in this book and it was like one intense rush 
adrenaline that lasted three months and i thinking about anything regarding myself or whether i had a good idea 
what the reception of the book would be i was just in this dreamscape this creative space i guess 
people call it the zone or whatever and so i was not thinking about anything outside of this imaginary 
that i was in sc but a wonderful example of the interaction between science and the humanities because whether 
not you wanted to make each one of those worlds physically plausible certainly a very close similarity to the 
of those worlds and what a real theoretical physicist does trying to invent a system al right true and 
i wonder whether a nonphysicist could have written that book and i think maybe so but i do think 
some of the ways that i thought about time or at least how to construct it were certainly aided 
my background in physics of course each of those dream worlds you have to match a conception of time 
a human story that illustrates that idea sc yeah and this is a great segue actually because this idea 
being in the zone of losing yourself feeds directly into your most recent book which not gonna get the 
exactly right sorry i have in front of me you must know the title right al searching for stars 
an island in maine sc there you go and you tackle a subject no one has ever written about 
really which is the relationship between science and religion and spirituality al well imagine that some people have written 
it before sc yeah no just kidding about that it seems to be something that a lot of people 
very interested in and everyone has their own little take and i think just to warn both you and 
and the audience probably you and i agree on many of the issues here and yet i suspect that 
conversation is going to feature a bit of the narcissism of small differences because the small differences matter in 
like this right this is material that is very very important and subtle and hard so okay to get 
the weeds about what you think is right and wrong al certainly certainly and i expect us to agree 
on everything sc so what was the inspiration for writing this book al always been interested in the dialogue 
science and religion and i think that those two institutions are the most powerful forces the two most powerful 
in the development of our civilization and i always wanted to write a book that was located in this 
that my wife and i spend every summer on for the last thirty years so i combined the two 
did not want to confront the subject of science and religion headon as said there have been many many 
have written on it and scholars who know much more than i do so i wanted to take a 
tangential approach and i wrote the book like an extended meditation as wandering about this island in maine sc 
had this wonderful very specific story that sure you told many times but tell it for the listeners they 
know it about being right off that island in your boat and feeling something al yes i was coming 
to the island one night in my boat and everybody who lives on the island all the families have 
own boat because a remote island and not connected by bridges or ferries i was coming back to the 
in my boat when night after midnight it was very quiet and it was a dark sky and i 
that i would turn off the engine of the boat and it got even quieter and then i turned 
the running lights and it got even darker and i lay down in the boat and just looked up 
the sky and with all of those wonderful sharp stars up there and i felt like i was falling 
infinity i felt like i had lost all sense of my body or time or space and i was 
part of the cosmos i felt a connection to something much larger than myself and i felt that the 
expanse of time before i was born and the infinite expanse of time after i will be dead all 
that seemed compressed to a dot it was a totally amazing experience and sure that you and other people 
had experiences like that sc and yet coming out of that experience you maintained firmly convinced in your materialist 
of the world right you did not leap from this experience to the existence of something outside the natural 
but you wanted to try to understand how we reconcile naturalism physicalism al correct sc lived experiences of this 
so how do we do that chuckle what lesson do you draw al well the experience that i had 
something that i call the transcendent experience and i know other people have used that word that terminology as 
and for me the transcendent experience in a nutshell is feeling that you are connected to something larger than 
that some order in the universe and the transcendent experience does not need to involve god in fact i 
pretty close to an atheist myself as i imagine that you are as well but i think there was 
something very powerful about that experience and something that cannot be studied quantitatively not reducible by usual methods of 
that is i think if you had connected every neuron of my brain to a giant computer during that 
of time where i was lying down in the boat looking up at the stars if you had the 
readout of every neuron in my brain i think it still would not have qualitatively conveyed the experience that 
had and i think those sorts of experiences to me represent the spiritual world al and i believe that 
that all of us have had experiences like that and we need to recognize them not easily analyzable by 
methods of science but another very very valid way of being in the world and i think that part 
this very very long history of people human beings connecting with the cosmos i think you can see it 
the cromagnon cave paintings in france and you can hear it in ninth symphony its an emotional connection to 
cosmos so the recognition of those kinds of experiences and the honoring of them and acceptance of them which 
or may not involve a belief in god is the way that i think that spirituality and science are 
sc yeah i think that one of the issues that one always faces here is the fact that just 
in doing science we talk about these concepts using vocabulary that has been handed down for hundreds of years 
right sc and freighted with certain connotations and so forth so and free will is another area of debate 
that comes in so in particular you seem to be willing to use the word spirituality but at the 
time not actually saying you believe in spirits right so what convinces you that might not be the right 
to use al well it may not be the right vocabulary and i wanna get hung up on words 
think that the description of the experience that i had in the boat lying up looking up at the 
and had other experiences like that and i imagine that many of your listeners have had experiences like that 
a description of the experience itself and the feelings that you have during such experiences is much more accurate 
trying to them up in a word like spirituality so when i use a word like that and aware 
it has a lot freight with it as does the word god that the word does not contain the 
so rather talk about the experience and we can give it when you and i talk about it in 
conversation we can give it some shorthand we could call it number seventeen or number or the letter gamma 
can refer to it in any way that we want as long as we know what referring to sc 
so let me give you an example i mean sorry let me give you an opportunity written this wonderful 
full of specific examples so rather than like you say debating the word which i really wanna do either 
you just offer a couple of more examples of what you mean by this i think that we are 
about universal human experiences but different people have different examples they would turn to when they talk about this 
of idea al you want me to give other examples from the book sc or not or from anywhere 
sort of surround the concept falling in love music looking at the stars art do you think science comes 
that matter al well i think when you listen to a piece of music that you are often carried 
to some kind of emotional space that you describe certainly falling in love is probably the most mysterious interaction 
two human beings and i think really unpredictable whether two human beings are going to fall in love with 
other you can look at their cvs ahead of time and that was not going to tell you whether 
to each other i can give one other illustration of a specific thing that happened to me if you 
take a couple of minutes to describe sc please yeah go ahead al and it also happened on this 
in maine but not all of my number seventeen experiences happen on this island but there was an nest 
one hundred feet from our house and every year for many years for a couple of decades there was 
family of ospreys that came every summer and the parents would come in the springtime and lay the eggs 
then the eggs would hatch around the beginning of june and the babies would grow up over the summer 
mother would stay on the nest and the father would go out and catch fish to feed the birds 
my wife and i used to watch this nest every summer and observe the life cycles of these birds 
we got to know them pretty well at least know the calls that they make and one summer i 
been watching these birds and i was standing on a second floor deck of our house and a circular 
and i was looking at the nest and they were looking at me al and so the baby birds 
have been growing up over the summer they take their first flight until the end of the summer and 
growing bigger and bigger all over through the summer and even a baby osprey is a pretty big bird 
know how many of your listeners are familiar with ospreys but the second biggest bird after an eagle and 
have a giant wing span and they have a very powerful claws so i had been looking at these 
ospreys over the summer and been looking back at me and to them it must have looked like i 
in my nest because i was on this circular deck that was about eye level with their nest and 
the time came for them to take their first flight and this was the beginning of august and so 
looking at each other all summer long and they took their first flight and the two adolescent birds who 
quite big by this time they did a big loop like about a mile in diameter and then they 
and they headed straight for me as i stood on this circular deck heading for me at great speed 
their claws were out laughter sc this sound very transcending to me this sounds al antitranscendent so my first 
was to run back into the house for cover but they easily could have ripped my face off but 
made me hold my ground and i kept standing there and the birds were coming towards me at great 
and when they got about twenty feet away i mean they were so close i could hear the wind 
around them they suddenly did an upward acceleration at about three gs and swooped and went over the roof 
the house but they had never flown before sc never flown before these are novice birds al but for 
a half a second or a second at most before they did this acceleration when they were about twenty 
away they looked me straight in the eye and never had any eye contact with any animal with any 
animal with my wife that was equal to that it was about a half of second of profound eye 
and i felt in that half second that they were talking to me and they were saying brothers we 
this land together and we have shared this land together and i sc we have decided not to rip 
face al they did not rip my face off and i felt all of that conveyed in that half 
of eye contact that was a transcendent experience for me sc yeah no this is very good glad that 
did tell the story because it helps to ground a little bit what talking about and i think that 
people would have stories that we can also relate to i had anything just like what you described but 
think i get it when you describe it right some other people might refer to experiences on psychedelics or 
meditation or in a trance state and one issue is some of these people who do this the language 
we use of being connected to something else whether something vast and cosmic or whether another creature right in 
of us is that evidence for something is it evidencefor something beyond the natural and i think you want 
say and is it evidence for something that is still within the natural world and maybe you wanna say 
then how do we talk about what that thing is al right well those are very good questions and 
think some people would say that it is evidence for something beyond the natural world some people would say 
for a realm what we might call my heaven some people might say evidence for the existence of a 
that some people might call god for me evidence of an acute sensitivity of human beings for certain kinds 
emotional experiences and related to the experience i had lying my back looking at the stars in maine related 
looking at a rembrandt painting or listening to a bach fugue i know what kind of language we can 
other than that it is an acute sensitivity to certain kinds of emotional experience a receptivity you have to 
receptive you have to be open to experiences like that and i think a key fact al a concept 
hinduism which and trying to remember it is something like dhaka and i think mispronouncing it and what it 
is an openness to the sublime and the sublime may or may not involve a deity or not but 
openness to these kinds of experiences sc so my second podcast guest talked about the sublime the first one 
ge wang who is a design professor and musician at stanford and both in a perfectly secular context and 
like the word sublime more than the word spiritual because i think that it have quite as much baggage 
nevertheless i think that important here is so both on the same side in the sense that we certainly 
there are experiences like this we see any reason to take them as evidence for something supernatural in any 
al right right sc but i think that you made a claim that it was a little provocative and 
wanna dig into it about the idea of opening up your brain and measuring all your neurons and you 
to claim that such a extremely hypothetical procedure would never reveal going on in experiences like this is that 
fair way to say it al well i think it would reveal going on at the microscopic level i 
that it would reveal all of the electrical output of the neurons and you can measure the chemical flows 
synapses i think it could reveal all of that in tremendous quantitative detail the question is after you had 
of that data would you be able to understand the sensation that i felt and close to the same 
as is sc right al very similar because all of these experiences are related to consciousness and the experience 
consciousness sc are you familiar with the idea the concept of supervenience have you heard your philosophy friends talk 
that sc supervenience al yes chuckle al no i heard that before sc a way of talking about this 
area where something depends on something but you necessarily see it there so something supervenes on something else if 
higher level supervening on a lower level what that means is that if the higher level were different it 
necessarily be the case that the lower level would also have to be different right the higher not just 
extra stuff but derivability is a much stronger concept than simply supervenience al right it sounds similar to the 
of emergent phenomenon sc right but emergence which i love as a phenomenon again has many different subversions of 
al right okay yeah sc so an attempt at making it a little bit more precise going on there 
okay alright sc but i think that what getting at is very similar to the thought experiment of mary 
color scientist which sure you do know about frank jackson had this idea that we would raise this woman 
in a black and white room but we would teach her everything there is to know about color so 
literally knows every fact about photons and a human color perception or whatever but she has never seen anything 
so the question is when she leaves the room and sees red does she learn something new and what 
said originally he later changed his mind but what he originally said was that course she learns something new 
learns what it is like to experience the color and so a very thomas nagel kind of talk where 
is some separate category for what it is like to experience something that is over and above the obvious 
inputs that we can easily figure out just by looking at your neurons al yeah yeah that all makes 
sense to me and of course the whole concept of experiencing something it is inseparable from the experience of 
sc right but i wanna push back a little bit because is are we giving up a little bit 
soon is it just that hard or it be hard even if we had the output of every single 
in your brain or the state of every single neuron in your brain that might be very very difficult 
figure out you know experiencing something but maybe just hard if someone gave you the ones and zeros in 
jpeg file it would be very difficult to look at a string and ones of zeros and tell you 
it was a picture of but it could be done in principle so is it that kind of distinction 
well i would never say that it be done in principle sc right al it may be that you 
look at the output of all of the neurons the electrical output and you could feed that output to 
person say you fed all the ones and zeros to another person who was not in the boat in 
sc yeah al but just plug it into their neural cortex it might be that they could have exactly 
experience i mean i do think that the world is ultimately all material i am a materialist and a 
to reconcile materiality with these experiences that we have the experiences are rooted in material things i mean just 
i think nothing in the brain except material atoms and molecules i think any magical essence but the experience 
consciousness which is some higher level or what is that word supervening sc yeah al phenomena that sensation that 
brought about by all of these electrical signals that that is so hard to get our hands around and 
know that this is called the hard problem in philosophy that very difficult to say to what extent we 
eventually completely nail this qualitative phenomenon sc yeah and i think that there is the question as you allude 
of how far we will get in the future but i think also this is getting to the important 
of the discussion in the sense that there is operationally a lesson to be learned now in your view 
the fact that very difficult right here and right now to talk about this experience in a reductionistic way 
yes sc so you would go so far i think as to say that there is a kind of 
or a kind of say knowledge you can correct me if a better word kind of knowledge we get 
these that is in some sense importantly different than the kind of knowledge we get from science al yes 
would say that and i would be surprised if you did not agree with me on that sc well 
that i even agree that not sure what you mean so i want you to tell me a little 
more about the sense in which this is knowledge i actually buy or original argument about mary the color 
or what it is like to be a bat etcetera i think there are two things the totality of 
physical world and then the second thing is the many many many ways that we talk about going on 
the physical world right al and experience the physical world so the word knowledge you were commenting earlier that 
lot of words that we use in our vocabulary are freighted and ambiguous and perhaps knowledge is one of 
words sc sure al probably every single word that using right now in our sentence is freighted sc weighted 
nicely al i remember that kurt gödel who was a member of the vienna circle in the came to 
point of view that he understand how anybody understood what anybody else was saying at any time because of 
ambiguity of every single word in a sentence so i would rather use a word like experience than knowledge 
also is fuzzy because knowledge seems to me to be more freighted even that experience or feeling an experience 
set of experiences or a set of feelings i believe that do not lend themselves to analysis by science 
that is right now with what we know right now that mean at some point in the future we 
not be able to do a better job at this but i would say that right now they do 
lend themselves to analysis by science and so the question is if you agree and you may only partly 
that there are such experiences what should be our attitude towards them we are a scientific and technological society 
we also have the arts and we have the humanities and how do we place these other feelings and 
that are not analyzable by science into the full context of being human and i think that we should 
them we should recognize that experiences that we have and feelings that do not lie within the scientific domain 
though they may be ultimately rooted in atoms and molecules sc right so i would say i think that 
sympathetic to the idea but i do have some issues with the vocabulary i know that there are some 
and philosophers for that matter who really actively think that the humanities would be better if they were subsumed 
the sciences and i think that is true as just a strategic fact about how to understand the world 
i were to make a sales pitch to those people i would say something like biology ultimately depends on 
standard model of particle physics right you think that biology involves laws of nature that the contradict our best 
of quantum field theory etcetera but we all agree that the best way to do biology is not to 
with the standard model of particle physics i mean come sc and i think that one can make a 
similar case for the humanities and i quite want to sign on to the language of not analyzable science 
that does sound a little more definitive and metaphysical than i want it to be i wanna say that 
best way that we have of understanding certain thing of learning certain things of gaining certain forms of wisdom 
more like reading books and falling in love and listening to music rather than by collecting data and fitting 
al yes i would agree with that and when i say not analyzable by the methods of science i 
at the current time sc yeah al it could be to go back to your particle physics biology metaphor 
could be that at some point in the future we know all of the laws of particles and forces 
physics and we have some master computer and we can just plug in or input a particular biological situation 
the computer will spit out the answer by going all the way down to the bottom of particles and 
that could happen in principle sc but even then even if that could happen i think now i wanna 
take on the other side al it be the best tool necessarily sc it be the best tool exactly 
think that daniel dennett makes this point very well that there is a simple computational algorithmic improvement when you 
things at a higher level you can get more out for less than if you just did the brute 
of the lower level microphysics and i think this is an important part of how the world works that 
have been otherwise right i mean we might have been in a world where in order to understand anything 
needed to understand what every atom and molecule in that thing i was doing right happily not in such 
world there are other vocabularies we can use that give us enormous understanding of going on al yeah and 
it depends on what you mean by the word understand sc also true yes very very much but good 
i think quite close on this issue and the other one that i wanted one of the other ones 
have other things to say al it would probably better if we close right sc i know yeah al 
would have a more interesting conversation sc well get there laughter sc you also have said in the context 
conversations like this you said some words that get certain ears perked up about faith and science in the 
that even scientists need a certain kind of faith so let you make the pitch for that and then 
think gonna disagree with it but see if we smooth it out al okay well what i mean by 
is belief in something that we prove what i mean by the word faith so begin by defining that 
and i believe that we scientists take it as a working hypothesis that the world is lawful sc yeah 
do chuckle al yes i do too and that the laws that we discover here on earth apply elsewhere 
the universe and we take that as a given and then go about solving our equations or doing our 
and the reason why i think that i consider that to be a question of faith is because the 
in something that we prove we prove that the universe is lawful a zillion light years away we prove 
and we even prove that the universe will be lawful tomorrow we prove that there may not be an 
that we do tomorrow that defies all of the laws that we discovered of course it could be that 
new law that we just found out that explains that phenomenon a question of matter of faith in the 
of these things in the way that i use the word faith ready for you to disagree and get 
another discussion chuckle sc good yeah so i think that our disagreements are small i disagree in two senses 
is this is an example where the word is too freighted by other connotations i mean you even sort 
gave away the game a little bit when you said when you were explaining it have provisional if you 
that science has provisional hypotheses then no one is gonna disagree with you right but the word faith does 
connotations that get in the way and i think a substantive difference because i can imagine scientists have this 
hypothesis for example that the laws of physics are the same from day to day right sc like that 
cannot solve david problem of induction but we can make an assumption that not a big problem that things 
the patterns from the past are a good guide to the future but i could imagine them changing their 
about that right or i could imagine that scientists think that their sense data is a relatively accurate reflection 
happening in the world but i can imagine them changing their minds about that if new data came in 
think that not so much a matter of faiths as it is prior probabilities and a bazian sense which 
easily be updated in a way that most religious people who talk about their faith probably would not allow 
al i agree with you mostly but i think that any scientist would ever say that some part of 
universe that is intrinsically not lawful and when i say lawful i mean that a base cause and effect 
that obeys ultimately some equation that you can solve that can be used to predict the phenomenon i think 
i know well chuckle i do know of a couple of scientists who believe that yeah i do know 
a couple of scientists who believe that but i would say that the majority of scientists do not and 
not question the assumption that the universe is a lawful place with lawfulness defined in the way that just 
and you can say whether i think that provisional i think that an uberassumption not provisional in the sense 
theory of general relativity is provisional because we know that it include quantum effects sc yeah al and ultimately 
will be a quantum theory of gravity which we just happen to possess at the moment not provisional in 
sense an underlying uberassumption that we make when we do science that the universe is a lawful place sc 
make it a little bit more specific make it more concrete and down to earth here do you think 
the methods of scientific investigation could in principle in some world or another lead scientists to believe that god 
al okay well you have to define what you mean by god sc yeah supernatural all powerful omnipotent being 
created the universe and cares about the lives of human beings here on earth al i think conceivable that 
could prove that such a being exists yes i think that if such a being existed and made itself 
in some way and scientists did various tests i think possible they would convince themselves this is the real 
i think that not impossible sc yeah okay good at the end of the day i think that both 
a way of understanding the world that is good bazianempiricist right of course we have some background assumptions but 
try to warn against ever setting the credence we give to almost any proposition to either zero or one 
that means that no amount of information would ever change your mind al right right sc and i think 
good scientists do that say that never gonna happen but what we really mean is we just think really 
unlikely right al right i totally agree with you yep sc okay so i think that given that our 
and ontological differences are rather small and maybe our differences are zero anywhere but a whole another set of 
that comes in here which is the more strategic questions like how should we engage publicly and for that 
privately on issues like this and i suspect that part of your motivation correct if wrong for writing a 
like this is to push back a little bit on the public efforts by some scientists and others to 
not just atheist but antireligion and you think going too far is that fair al i do think going 
far antireligion yes yes i think going too far sc so how do you think the scientists should talk 
or talk about religious belief in the public sphere al wonderful question i think that the physical world is 
domain of science and i think that any statements about the physical world such as how many years ago 
earth was formed are in the domain of science and i think that those kinds of statements or questions 
be subjected to the kind of inquiry that we do to scientific inquiry if you have a belief in 
world that lies outside of the physical world then i think that science has that much to say about 
a belief and an example of that would be if you believed in a supreme being who created the 
but a being who does not subsequently enter the universe and interfere with it or do what we commonly 
miracles then that belief to me is compatible with science because your supreme being is not entering or interfering 
the physical world and i think that those kinds of beliefs should be respected i think that people who 
religious faith should be respected even people who have a belief in a god that does intervene or is 
i think that you could argue with them and say i think that the physical events are part of 
physical world and have to be subjected to the methods of but there are a lot of intelligent people 
have such beliefs and now talking about belief in an intervening god sc absolutely yeah al there are a 
of intelligent people who have such beliefs and i think that we politely disagree with them when i say 
i mean people like you and me who have very similar views we politely disagree with them but we 
to them we respect their beliefs i mean i can respect a belief that i agree with i can 
them as a person and what has disturbed and upset me about the group of scientists in recent years 
have used scientific arguments to try to disprove the existence of god this group of people that we sometimes 
the neoatheists what bothers me about them is any statements that appear to be dismissive or condescending to believers 
well just to be very clear this will come up sure the idea of respect is an important one 
a crucial one and worth getting it right because you gone back and forth between saying we should respect 
beliefs and we should respect the people who have them and i know some people are gonna say wait 
minute i can respect the person who has them but i do them any favors by anything other than 
their belief if i think al well i said that i think you can disagree with them there are 
and democrats who disagree on the role of the federal government and managing things at the state level and 
are valid intellectual discussions and probably issues that will never be solved and the ongoing conversation is healthy certainly 
should respect the people who have those beliefs unless they have some kind of misbehavior other kinds of misbehavior 
lose our respect but on the belief itself i think that all entitled to believe what we believe and 
defend it by what other arguments we have people who believe in a god that intervenes in the physical 
and performs miracles i just believe that and i will argue against that using all of the knowledge of 
that i have but in the end not going to say that that person is a fool or is 
nonthinker sc sure but are there some beliefs that deserve respect what do we do with people who are 
staters or homeopaths or antivaxxers or astrology buffs do because i would still like to respect the people if 
if good people and if charitable or whatever but is that a different category than believing in an interventionist 
al well i think that similar people who if someone had came and told me that they believe that 
night while asleep that the moon turns purple and then it turns white again when i wake up i 
just say do an experiment and test that so my attitude towards people who have beliefs about the physical 
that i consider nonsensical i would say do the experiment and find and i think that some years ago 
feynman did something very similar to this with magicians there were magicians who claimed that they had esp or 
remember what are the words are when you sc telekinesis maybe al telekinesis yes telekinesis i think this was 
the and he actually had serious conversations with such people and said test this and i think that he 
had an open mind sure that he had an opinion about the way it was going to turn out 
he actually did experiments with such people and that i thought was a very respectful way to such people 
their beliefs sc at the end of the day how much of this just comes down to personality i 
that some people just kind of take joy in being a little feistier to be polite about it be 
combative and people on both sides i mean al yeah yeah no i agree with you i think partly 
matter of personality sc yeah al i totally agree yeah sc i know in politics this is certainly true 
probably in talk about religion also true and this tendency we all have to have a favorite way of 
things and then to believe that that favorite way of doing things is also operationally the best right if 
far leftist you say like being far leftist will actually get us more and if centrist being more centrist 
being far right or whatever how do we know if we say there are certain things that we all 
to be true we want the people to be rational and evidencebased and believe in science how do we 
whether we attained those goals by having the strategy of talking in more respectful ways about their beliefs versus 
coming out and saying come on just al well a great question and i know the answer to that 
i suspect that the optimum strategy would vary from one individual to the next that is i think there 
some people that you and i might consider have crazy beliefs crazy in our opinion that would be susceptible 
leading them through a rational argument and i suspect there are other people who have the same crazy beliefs 
just different people who would not be receptive to leading them through rational arguments so i really think that 
depends on your zip code your local zip code sc yeah al your really local zip code and i 
that not a situation where one size fits all i think that in dealing with people who think that 
change is a hoax for example that we lump them all into one category that we need to find 
more about those people and why they have their beliefs and tailor our argument or our dialogue with them 
the people or another strategy might be to put out all different strategies and hope that the people will 
that the individual people with their own zip codes will be swayed by the particular strategy that appeals to 
sc yeah i think that i can make arguments on both of this one personally and i have i 
that on the one hand a really fullthroated insistence that god does not exist and we should be more 
and so forth like we get from richard dawkins most famously has had a very salutory effect on the 
discussion i think that twenty years ago it was considered less respectable to be atheist in public than it 
today so i think that had a good effect on the other hand had a bad effect in the 
that a community of people who really just enjoy patting themselves on the back for being more rational than 
fellow human beings right in a way that is maybe not productive and more about point scoring than about 
the world a better place al yes well i think that richard dawkins could have had pretty much the 
impact that he had the salutory impact that you were referring to without having the ridiculing dismissive condescending attitude 
believers that had i think that that was a necessary ingredients of the cake sc possible part of me 
whether or not like telling someone if they tell you a story about how they went to vegas and 
were playing blackjack and they were up fifty thousand dollars and they lost it all and you say you 
have quit after won fifty thousand dollars and i feel like saying but the kind of person who would 
after they won fifty thousand dollars would never have won fifty thousand dollars in the first chuckle al well 
yeah yeah yeah a good point yeah possible that you could create richard dawkins in a version that did 
include that aspect the ridiculing and the condescension and so on so a fair point i argue with you 
sc and i think that the forwardlooking question is how do we fit in the real implications or potential 
of religious belief on to how we act in society coming from essentially atheist scientific perspective i remember once 
was at one of these gatherings of many people from many different disciplines and so forth and i was 
on a panel to discuss the relationship between religious belief and public policy and it was like ten people 
the panel and i was the only atheist and i was really there as like a little entertainment al 
foil sc right yeah yeah and indeed the only question i was asked was is the best argument you 
for religious belief even though you have it and i think that not there yet in terms of not 
think that atheists now have a seat at the table in a way they did it before but they 
a lot oomph they have a lot of juice when it comes to really saying as a naturalist who 
that the laws of morality are not handed down by god here is the implications that i draw for 
we actually live here in the do you have thoughts about how we can be better al well the 
thought is just that not to ridicule believers thought number one sc yeah al to respect their intelligence because 
are many many believers who are quite intelligent people i think that we can talk about morality which is 
of the aspects of religion without invoking god or supernatural events i think that we need god to give 
a code for moral behavior the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you 
to me has always been the supreme guide for moral behavior is found in all religions also found in 
which even believe in a supreme being so i think that there are ways that we can talk about 
and moral behavior that involve the supernatural realm i know whether i could say a lot more than that 
sc well i certainly agree with you there i guess my question is more given that where can we 
some of the moral authority that our society tends to give on priests and faithbased people al yeah a 
question i think that you can get some moral authority by referring to nonbelievers who are unquestionably very moral 
humanitarian people and just as we sometimes refer to people like mahatma gandhi as being a spiritual leader who 
us with some kind of moral compass i believe that there are atheists in the world they might not 
card carrying burn the house down atheists but quiet atheists and i think probably a quiet atheist who by 
own behavior demonstrate principles of morality and human humanitarian behavior and caring for other human beings so the best 
that i know of accumulating moral authority outside of the standard religious platform sc yeah i do think that 
idea of just being a good example is underrated when it comes to trying to influence things trained to 
rational arguments but rational arguments as an actual strategy to change the world to take you so far but 
take you as far as you might wanna go al yes sc so to wrap up i think the 
thing i wanted to ask you we talked about morality in a naturalistic context but coming back to your 
also the question of meaningfulness in a naturalistic context right al oh yes a wonderful question sc yeah a 
of people who are gonna say like care about the argument from design or the finetuning arguments or the 
arguments for the existence of god what i care about is the fact that it gives my life purpose 
believe that a bigger thing out there that a reason why i believe do you think it is a 
between this kind of transcendent experience that you focused on in the book and how secular people can find 
and purpose in their own lives al well interesting that you asked this because a couple of nights ago 
was at an event at mit sponsored by the organization called veritas sc oh yeah done that too al 
that too and there was a philosopher from notre dame megan i remember her last name we were talking 
meaning and she argued that a meaningful life is found by doing things that are valued by god sc 
al and since god provides permanence in eternity that we are connecting our values with things that are permanent 
fastening ourselves onto god and during the next part of the conversation between me and her it was an 
conversation i asked her suppose an agnostic or an atheist then are you out of and i think that 
assumption here is that meaning the assumption that i want to question is whether meaning requires permanence do you 
to have some scaffolding that is permanent or eternal which of course of god provides if you are to 
meaning and if you believe in god as you and i that scaffolding of permanence exist and even as 
know very well our entire universe will end or go into a emptiness at some point in the future 
really nothing permanent in the physical universe and if god exist then what is there and worried about this 
lot myself and the conclusion come to is that you are making a fallacy when you start off with 
assumption that meaning requires permanence al and come around to the point of view which is very hard to 
but i believe in that you have to find meaning in the present moment this also is a buddhist 
although the buddhists do have their nirvana which is permanent but just enjoy and be open to every moment 
experience every moment for what it is and i think that where meaning lies for me sc yeah no 
am completely on board with that a reason why in my last book the big picture where i talk 
these things a little bit i emphasize the fact that all gonna die chuckle in a chapter called three 
heartbeats the average number of heartbeats in the human lifespan and i think a crucial thing i think that 
much as atheism or naturalism has increased in popularity and acceptance over the past few decades a lot still 
for atheists and naturalists to do in getting their worldview all together right and part of that is that 
most atheist and naturalistic among them still implicitly cling to some standards that have been handed down by religious 
and i think you pinpointed one about the permanence right like if something permanent then al right yes yes 
and i think the same thing for morality a lot of people who think that unless you have rock 
absolutely objective moral guidelines you have nothing and i think that the secret implication of naturalism and atheism and 
is that you have to buy into temporariness and fuzziness and contingency and perspective and some things are just 
there effectively and permanently and okay al yes i totally agree with you sc so i guess the very 
question is this is not a small question but are there programmatic things that a naturalist can do to 
or improve their hold on meaning and meaningfulness in the world is it meditation is it going to music 
it having an island in maine retreat or what can we all do al this is something that you 
do for your just yourself this is a personal activity for your personal meaning sc say sure al say 
talking about trying to write impactful books to affect hundreds of thousands of other people talking about what can 
do in your own life to give meaning to your own life if you are say an atheist or 
or a secularist sc well as part of my meaning pluralism i think that some people will very naturally 
inward looking when it comes to meaning and some people will be very naturally outward looking and i think 
one is okay if where they find it al yeah right well i think that the first thing to 
is the recognition that no cosmic meaning that not gonna find meaning and the recipe to lead a meaningful 
written on some tablets out there in outer space sc yeah al and important to recognize that a very 
first step and every person has to find meaning for themselves and what is meaningful to you may not 
meaningful to someone else it might be very meaningful to you to go out and have a quiet dinner 
friends and a nice glass of wine and talk and for someone else that might be a total waste 
time sc a date of boredom yes laughter al right worse than a waste of time sc yeah al 
that other person might find something very meaningful sitting at home listening to a bach fugue and i think 
wrote about happiness and said that you never know when happy when happening always in retrospect that you know 
the moment and it may be the meaning is like that that you try to do experiences that you 
are worthwhile and they make you feel good and it may be that only later in retrospect that you 
was a meaningful sc yeah i do tend to wonder whether or not those of us who feel moved 
talk about meaning in some careful way might not to prejudice bach fugues over going to baseball games i 
that we probably need to do a better job of bringing meaning to a more universal level but we 
i think that personal and different people are gonna find it different ways and that is a not a 
in the system al right not a flaw in the system and a key insight into this discussion i 
sc yeah absolutely alright this has been very helpful very meaningful hopefully people will find some transcendent experiences in 
last hour or so alan lightman thanks so much for being on the podcast al thank you sean great 
be with you music resumindo e concluindo é sempre enriquecedor ouvirler sobre opiniões de alguém que consideremos inteligentes respeito 
todos inteligentes menos inteligentes interessante e principalmente a conotação de muitas palavras que poderão induzir em conclusões não apropriadas 
nada é garantido até que seja provado ciência e sobrenatural an extremely interesting and important podcast for me an 
a memorable spiritual experience was the moment when i read in the grundrisse the words time ie time for 
full development of the grundrisse notebook vii i felt that i knew the total project that marx had in 
including the books on socialism and communism that he never managed to write and that he was right i 
that anyone who reads the paragraph from which that statement is taken with an open mind and who fully 
it would believe that he had laid down the fundamental basis for social organization re altered states of consciousness 
seems one department where it seems beneficial to make the distinction we can describe these states empirically but in 
cases the significance of them is what is experienced can only be conveyed lyrically at best indeed even if 
were to describe the entire process at the fundamental physical level and then replicate it in an allpowerful computer 
is the significance significance of it to the end user that matters or would the act of perfectly simulating 
an experience also encompass its significance i take this ways of talking approach it as coming close the muchdeplored 
which alan seems to endorse but does it also relate to concept of interesting thoughts in the podcast re 
coupling of meaning and the assumed need for permanence good question what do we mean by it is really 
that he mentioned symphony there is a scene in the movie where the movie suggests that inspiration for ode 
joy came while he was a child laying on his back in a pond looking at the stars it 
a beautiful scene a very interesting discussion about science materialism and reality it seems to me that on this 
one should ask is materialism sufficient to explain all of reality we are carbon based creatures consisting solely of 
elements yet carbon has become aware that it is carbon carbon speaks do materialistic forces draw words out of 
it may be that questions such as these have led to panpsychism which is the theory that all natural 
have a spark of consciousness but this of course interjects the inclusion of something nonmaterial into the natural world 
for me i think that is highly improbable that our inner subjective experiences could emerge solely from material elements 
matter how they are organized of course i could be wrong i liked the beginning of this interview alan 
was likable and interesting but the longer it went the more it seemed he for some reason had an 
for religion why would he use the word to describe what scientists do why does he think someone who 
nonsense should be respected what does respect mean then why does he think significant that a readout of his 
provide an understanding of his experience when it even provide an understanding of basic consciousness but may some day 
does he think that criticism of religion is inappropriate when religion is obviously a major source of disruption and 
behavior around the world anything but a private matter as so many seem to think my sense was that 
and sc were not close but miles apart the experience of transcendence obviously spans different cultures and time periods 
a human being had a transcendent experience two hundred thousand years ago or perhaps even twenty thousand years ago 
could enjoy it and simply be happy it happened by five thousand years ago she would be tempted to 
it to others in words and would perhaps attempt to convince others who pointedly did not have the experience 
she then knew something they and was special in some new way because of it using words since this 
experience which actually be described in words then or now was so powerful and her words so forceful she 
perhaps be successful in influencing others hence some sort of religion would be born but the others would not 
the original experience just the words describing it they would become followers something perhaps programmed to do given our 
nature and ad hoc brain development sadly by following with words the followers cut off or greatly reduced their 
chances of having such experiences themselves because words are little points of discrimination the experience of transcendence is that 
discriminate at all it makes whole cloth of everything how described by everyone had such an experience including mr 
as he so eloquently stated the dreadful mistake that humans made in general is that they personalized such experiences 
they become exclusive to meusour group religion and not to others but humans then did not understand the consequences 
doing that of excluding others consequences that are all too obvious today sean asked how we could influence the 
provide more oomph what is the best argument for religious belief that it is a natural consequence of a 
experience capable of being experienced by all humans and perhaps by some animals that went tragically awry through ignorance 
think that a good explanation basically we know what we were doing like we know so many things then 
themselves have a history of ad hoc development it seems i think the buddhists come closest to understanding the 
and make it more accessible by depersonalizing it into were right therefore it now if we could just depersonalize 
never mind i enjoyed the episode just finished the podcast how can you be a but yet understand how 
people can believe in a supernatural being i do not believe in magic like harry potter magic not presdigitation 
supernatural must be magic as you have described in the big picture we have described all the forces of 
there is no force for esp telekinesis angels or mystical intervention by a supreme being i can understand that 
is something one grows up with and that it may provide solace and comfort but it can not be 
nelson asks why alan lightman would use to describe what scientists do the century christian existential philosopher paul tillich 
that ultimate concern is a form of faith has an ultimate concern and this concern can be an act 
if the act of faith includes the denial of tillich also wrote that is not a being but the 
of all the ultimate concern for scientists is to discover and elucidate the secrets of nature and the scientific 
is the tool that they use however history tells us that our greatest achievements as a species are the 
giant steps we have taken in the understanding of nature the mystery of human understanding may be the greatest 
to scientific inquiry and more and more resources are being directed to this effort there are scientists who think 
it is not likely that our brains will ever understand how they understand but there are also scientists who 
faith that ultimately they will know how this phenomenon occurs and are willing to devote their professional lives to 
effort in my opinion naturalism is a religion just like the religions it is trying to do without it 
a belief originated by passion feeling delusion just like any other belief there can be no equation nor theorem 
constitute proof of the nonexistence of supernatural a believer will see plenty of signs of supernatural events in our 
naturalists see any because they want to moreover naturalist ethic is grounded in human nature only scientists determined we 
to homo sapiens genus in reality our genus is ferox assassin stupidus anything but sapiens just have a look 
current global warming caused by human greed and the insane pursuit of well being glad to have had the 
to hear from lightman i recently interviewed two scientists who started the five hundred women scientists movement i suppose 
have been but i was a little surprised that by way of promoting both science and social justice they 
me that one of their messages is that science is not the only of when i pressed them on 
issue asking for example whether or not they personally would subscribe to ways of ie religion perhaps the transcendent 
that lightman has experienced over science in any situation they seemed ambivalent then they recommended i read lightman beyond 
i have read having listened to lightman and carroll it seems to me that the former is simply more 
to ascribe some if i can use the word mystical interpretation of what some have called of which had 
handful in both vivid and more mundane circumstances from the tops of mountains to riding my bike down a 
road what lightman do successfully in my opinion is offer an explanation of why such peak experiences cannot or 
not be attributed to physical functions in the brain or why they should be considered differently than say a 
episode of grief at the loss of a pet or friend i love nature and wildlife and have been 
particular fascinated with ospreys for many years thank you david gessner for your book of the i would love 
have been in perch when two juvenile ospreys divebombed him that must have been a remarkable experience i talk 
animals all the time including snakes birds alligators though i expect that they understand me and i know for 
benefit but lightman seems ready to propose that his interpretation of that peak experience is a fact and not 
his wonderful creative human brain striving at poetry to describe a remarkable experience in other words he seems too 
it seems to me to give that experience more objective meaning than it probably had and surely he believe 
the ospreys shared that experience if he does a whole other area where i think we would disagree in 
end suspicious of ways of because i know how that is supposed to work a religious believer says know 
are miracles and i see evidence of god every day in the fair enough but should we simply accept 
assertion at an way of or can we legitimately say try to examine this through methods we know to 
reliable results based on overwhelming evidence ie the scientific if the answer is an way of knowing so it 
beyond then i think worth very much as a of it becomes an assertion and a claim and i 
think we should operate on the basis of undemonstrated assertions or claims so when scientists are the ones asserting 
there are ways of i find myself somewhat disturbed that attitude would seem to open the door to any 
all whether or not it reflects reality or not comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds
