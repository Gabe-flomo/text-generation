and by now in this society we live in everyone understands that information is something very important whether the 
of information we get over the internet in terms of news and happening what the going to be like 
next day but also information in a more technical sense if you have a company it needs information about 
sales are going on where the customers are what products are available and what you should be selling if 
scientist information is the data that you have about the universe information is another way of thinking about what 
know about the world so an extremely general concept but there is so much information around us right now 
it becomes a subject in its own right to understand what information is and how best to harness it 
carroll really no better person to talk to than guest césar hidalgo césar was trained as a physicist but 
quickly got into the idea of statistical mechanics of information which led him believe it or not into economics 
he started studying not just economics in its own right but how data flows through economic channels and how 
becomes actual physical products sean carroll now after spending a long time as the lead of collective learning group 
is newly a chair at the university of toulouse in france but also the head of a startup company 
data wheel been very involved in data visualization and how that can help us understand happening in different places 
the world i can really recommend his book called why information grows that starts much like this conversation about 
listen to does from the basics of what we mean by information at the level of physics or even 
into how information moves around whether through a biological organism through a society through a culture through an economy 
different lens a different way of thinking about going on all around us a very charismatic proponent of thinking 
information in interesting ways i think going to like this go sean carroll césar hidalgo welcome to the mindscape 
césar hidalgo thank you sean carroll you started as a physicist is that right césar hidalgo right sean carroll 
you moved at any point were you officially an economist césar hidalgo no i never got a degree in 
but been working on topics related to economics i would say now for fifteen years sean carroll okay so 
know the lingo pretty crosstalk césar hidalgo exactly and i have a lot of colleagues and enemies in sean 
colleagues and enemies is a way to put it but now also very interested in data visualization and things 
that to who are not an expert in any of these areas what is the foot view of all 
like how do you think of your project of putting these things together césar hidalgo the way that i 
my work is i say that i focus on collective learning what i try to do is to understand 
teams cities nations and countries learn how do they acquire new knowledge and how they put that new knowledge 
use to do that i do a lot of things i study the creation diffusion and valuation of knowledge 
contributed a lot to that literature and economic geography in innovation but i also have created lots of platforms 
integrate and distribute large volumes of public and private data as a way to improve the way that we 
our world sean carroll does the physics background help you here césar hidalgo i think so because at the 
of the day what you rescue from an education like that of physics is that to understand the world 
need to always have an interplay between theories and experience that duality is useful in physics but useful in 
and useful in in most other fields so i do think that my work still is always in the 
between what the data is telling us and how we interpreted sean carroll but even more than that you 
i read your wonderful book why information grows césar hidalgo yes sean carroll the word is obviously playing a 
role here information has different definitions in different contexts closely related to things like entropy that physicists care about 
do you think about information what is your idea since you say that word césar hidalgo of course it 
with who am i talking to but in a more technical sense i like to think of information as 
sort of third thing that is very basic and important to understand in the universe we have things that 
of matter things that we can touch or that have some sort of embodiment but we also have the 
of those things we can think of in terms of energy and momentum and so forth but a third 
that we need to consider which is not things nor how moving but how arranged or ordered to me 
basic idea of information like the sequence of things the way in which you stack a deck of cards 
you shuffle a deck of cards you change the mass you change the energy but changing something that order 
information sean carroll i guess probably people when you say the word they think that that information is about 
that it contains meaning not just data when you shuffle a deck of cards the meaning really change or 
it does not quite sure how you think about it césar hidalgo maybe a better analogy than a deck 
cards is to think of dna if i change the sequence of nucleic acids on dna i can transform 
piece of dna from encoding one protein to encode in a different protein that protein and what it does 
in the context in which being used you can think of that as the meaning but the little piece 
dna that is a certain sequence know really about that meaning that meaning is beyond it part of the 
and the way that that sequence of order interacts with the rest of the environment césar hidalgo i try 
think of information when i think about it in fundamental terms as those sequences but of course when talking 
someone for example from the field of communication or media studies understand that information there is much more related 
meaning and you can have concepts like misinformation which in the dna example would be a little bit harder 
build sean carroll i guess what trying to get at for the dna molecule or just for a set 
letters on a page is any arrangement equally contain the same amount of information or do they contain more 
if the context in cares about what they say in some way césar hidalgo well it depends on which 
using again if thinking from a pure shannon perspective basically a random sequence is going to be the one 
contains more information because sean carroll more information yeah césar hidalgo the hardest to predict sean carroll you know 
means nothing césar hidalgo exactly but say now in the context of communication and trying to communicate something to 
what are words that are going to contain more informations are the ones that reduce your uncertainty more about 
trying to say maybe a more useful way to think about information in that context is not simply how 
bits do i need to encode something but how much do i reduce your uncertainty with each beat that 
provide to you sean carroll okay good this is sounding nice and physicsy and i like this going to 
to the role of information in economies and firms and networks and things like that but stick with the 
angle here i mean how do you think about the origin of information inaudible all the way back to 
evolution of the universe or the evolution of life or something like that césar hidalgo a good question because 
some way information and order and complexity is conspicuous in our planet we were marveled at it every time 
go and see a landscape or walk around the city but at the same time if we were to 
a space ship and travel across our solar system or beyond we would see a universe that is quite 
not everywhere complexity actually concentrates in places like our planet and it leads us to ask why is our 
so rich in complexity where other places are so and sean carroll like the moon is not césar hidalgo 
sean carroll that rich in complexity césar hidalgo the morning is not complex or even like if you go 
that tihamah desert here in our planet going to find places that actually have too much structure beyond in 
geological formations that you can find there sean carroll and some telescopes these days by the way césar hidalgo 
yeah indeed to understand the origin of this complexity and this order i think the best solutions that found 
is work like that of ilya prigogine ilya as you know very well is a very famous statistical physicists 
chemist that he started to physical systems that were out of equilibrium near equilibrium but out of it he 
that those systems that were out of equilibrium tended to selforganize into what he called the dissipative structures think 
the little whirlpool that forms when you take the plunger out of a bathtub a structure that is not 
there are correlations there there are certain order structure that structure is something that emerges when that system is 
through a state in which flowing in the system in which is like going from one energy state to 
césar hidalgo he says when the systems are out of equilibrium when moving from one state to another these 
of organize that is an important group because if you think about it a lot of the structure that 
have serving nature in life and life is an outofequilibrium system that has to be sustained by energy flows 
have to eat many times a day breathing and we do get energy also out of the oxygen that 
breathe a lot of energy consumption that we need to stay out of equilibrium because the only way to 
our level of organization is to stay out of that equilibrium i think precaution is the one that gives 
a first good clue of why structuring the universe sean carroll yeah so in other words from the perspective 
someone like me if you just let the system go all by itself it would go to a maximum 
state be boring equilibrium who the bathtub would just become flat the water on top of it but saying 
following prigogine that in the right circumstances if you feed it some energy in fact some energy in a 
form then it obtains this orderly configuration i guess césar hidalgo exactly conspicuous not only in biology now our 
live around electronics that they become useless the moment that the battery runs out able to process information able 
show information on their screens encoded us as pixels or whatever using as a display type of technology because 
energy that energy consumption now is essential to kind of like keep order because otherwise entropy what it does 
carroll what should we say that differentiates really the earth from the moon in this case i mean at 
same distance from the sun right césar hidalgo yeah but i think here a lot of things that have 
that allow us to preserve information effectively also like a chemical complexity that maybe might be missing in places 
the moon on the one hand we do have an atmosphere that makes a big difference and we do 
oceans which also make a big difference those structures together with others have been able to create path dependencies 
replicators like dna and rna to create order sustain it and reproduce it in some way the complexity that 
today is not the result of like an instantaneous event or a condition that is present today on earth 
not present in the moon but also of a long path dependent process in which this complexity has grown 
time because able to generate more of it per unit of time than we lose you know sean carroll 
yeah i mean i guess if i actually thought about this long going to say things that could be 
wrong but probably venus even though it has an interesting looking atmosphere the surface of it from the few 
that we have look that different from the moon i mean like there are some rocks lying around and 
more organized than that and probably there are conditions specifically to earth related to the existence of both solids 
liquids and things like that that allow for these channels to open up and complexity to develop is that 
right way to think about it césar hidalgo i think so yeah of course this is a tough question 
we would have a succinct answer we would have had like the soundbite that solves the problem of the 
of life sean carroll i know yeah césar hidalgo but i do think that even though we might not 
that we do have clues of some of the conditions that that lead to the creation of complex structures 
as life and one of those is the need to have energy flows but the need also of not 
them that quickly and to be able to preserve the structure and here on planet earth we do that 
having certain solids and crystals that support the structure for instance dna is a very stable molecule that is 
to preserve a lot of complexity and information over long periods of time and with the ability to replicate 
us to have the conditions that we need not only to preserve information but then to make it grow 
carroll not even perfectly stable right i mean if dna were absolutely stable never changed do the job you 
this kind of flexibility i guess césar hidalgo exactly you need to be able to explore those spaces of 
so that you can actually then grow in complexity because complexity requires diversity sean carroll some simple version of 
which is just that when entropy is low in some sense a lot of information because you know a 
about the system but making the point that this complexity that gives us the ability to really make use 
that information is that the right way to say it césar hidalgo yeah i do think that complexity in 
ways is kind of like a better term maybe because a little bit more loosely defined for most people 
i do think that when you talk about the planet earth as a planet that has a lot of 
maybe people think about the medium the libraries when you think about it as a place that is very 
maybe people get a better idea that talking about like that complexity that is involved in ecosystems and our 
that is absent from the moon and also absent from libraries sean carroll yeah yeah so this interplay i 
i understood it better maybe because no one does between complexity and information in some sense making the point 
complexity makes use of information and information makes complexity possible so not sure that the same thing but there 
at least symbiotic césar hidalgo yeah i do think that related on a part of kind of like a 
of symbiotic relationships the other aspect that i do think is important on that relationship is what i call 
capacity to compute if we go back to the dna analogy you can think of the dna and you 
think of the cell dna by itself is quite useless it cannot reproduce by itself it requires all of 
machinery the same is true for a lot of information that we have like a recipe without a kitchen 
without a cook cannot transform itself into a dish césar hidalgo we do have also that ability to then 
a piece of encoded information as a set of instructions and transform it into something that ability to transform 
into new information or to reproduce it or to recombine it is that computational capacity that serving biology serving 
that i think is the true mystery so i call that knowledge and my separation between knowledge and information 
information is what is encoded and knowledge is this ability to make you can make things by making a 
a car is information an organized structure just like dna or you can have knowledge when you are making 
new cell type cell differentiate and that knowledge that ability to make is ultimately what is hard to accumulate 
at the biological level and at the social level sean carroll you said the word before compute the ability 
compute now saying you believe to make are those the same thing césar hidalgo in a lax language when 
carroll yeah we can relax worry césar hidalgo exactly at feet away from or more yes i would say 
have these order structures and you have the ability to make those order structures that ability to make we 
call it the ability to compute the ability to transform a string of bits into another string of bits 
those bits are encoded on a magnetic tape or on a piece of dna from this perspective it would 
relevant of course there are other situations in which you want to make those distinctions sean carroll right presumably 
phase transitions or at least transformations along the way where the system becomes better and better at the accumulating 
using information césar hidalgo yep yep sean carroll so life would be one multicellular life thinking of all these 
i just had a podcast a little while ago with kate jeffery who is a neuroscientist and i had 
a talk saying how complexity can evolve and she wanted to say but also it goes away sometimes because 
are disastrous and césar hidalgo exactly sean carroll and not at all guaranteed that it comes in and just 
monotonically césar hidalgo yeah indeed i think true for economies societies and ecosystems seen the collapse of ecosystems we 
be risking a big ecosystem collapse now with climate change and we do see it in social process like 
of social unrest there are countries that sometimes everybody thinks that going fine and things turn very quickly like 
is happening in chile this week what has happened in many places in the past sean carroll yeah no 
this is definitely going on make that transition presume that the last fifteen minutes everyone understands the origin of 
and how it takes in lowentropy energy at what point does life become economics at what point do we 
about trading information back and forth like that césar hidalgo what i try to communicate in why information grows 
know if i succeed but what i try to communicate is at the end of the day you have 
systems that have a finite ability to accumulate knowledge to accumulate that capacity to make the only way that 
systems can transcend that limited capacity is by developing collective phenomenon collective systems that include multiple units you go 
single cellular organisms to multicellular organisms because you could never achieve the level of complexity of a multicellular organism 
a singlecelled organism but multicellular organisms they peak at the human say sean carroll so far as far as 
know yeah césar hidalgo as far as we know humans also have limited capacity the older you get the 
that you realize that you know very very very very little about everything that could eventually be known humans 
that capacity by forming teams teams transcend those capacities by forming organizations organizations transcend those capacities by belonging to 
and also by having cities and you have these different like russian doll structure of organizations that then grow 
the way to our planet in which able to accumulate more complexity and more knowledge more vulnerability to make 
always renormalizing in ourselves into groups of the units that bumped into a ceiling sean carroll so division of 
in some sense césar hidalgo exactly sean carroll is really getting us all this knowledge césar hidalgo but division 
knowledge which i would say is different than the division of labor because i can have a division of 
in which all doing the same thing and have more of us doing the same thing but the division 
knowledge is quite different because doing different things and passing on those inputs to each other as a way 
create things that would be impossible for each one of us to do césar hidalgo when making an aircraft 
that you have company in which making an aircraft by themselves with a hammer and with some metal doing 
different and that allows them to create a few aircraft a year that are the product now if you 
in a lower complexity say activity like the production of tshirts in that case you might have more of 
division of labor and less of a division of knowledge you might have warehouses full of seamstress that all 
the same task doing the same shirt and in that case you have more of a division of labor 
have economies of scale but you have that division of knowledge that you would have served in a complex 
like pharmaceuticals or aircraft manufacturing sean carroll i presumed that for a complicated aircraft literally nobody who has all 
knowledge required to do it césar hidalgo of course yeah the whole point and idea that basically you can 
of the complexity of an industry as the number of what i call person bytes of knowledge sean carroll 
bytes césar hidalgo yeah sean carroll bytes césar hidalgo exactly of knowledge that you would need to be able 
create a product sean carroll yeah okay but was did we skip ahead when i think of economics in 
i mean i think of trade and barter and maybe currency and value and those can precede this sort 
division of knowledge or not not sure césar hidalgo yeah so in some way my way to enter economics 
been through a gap in the literature that was there in which products were very much considered like some 
of epiphenomenon that was not very differentiated in the economics literature economics is a field that comes more from 
like bankers and merchants so kind of more about trade and interest rates sean carroll money césar hidalgo prices 
money and the cost of employment and those things but whether producing ladders or producing apples or producing cars 
producing tshirts are things that are differentiated not too much in the models and the empirical work that was 
in the literature i think i was lucky to enter the field at a moment in which more fine 
data was becoming available and that allowed us to start characterizing products and industries in a more fine grain 
not just by talking about how much labor or capital they need but by actually looking at the patterns 
production to be able to infer how much knowledge they need to be produced or other properties that differentiate 
in ways that the traditional literature had not maybe paid attention to sean carroll do you think that kind 
differentiation was there from the start from the first primitive economies or is it something that allowed economies to 
off later in the game césar hidalgo another differentiation is actually very hard to achieve one thing that is 
conspicuous when you look at international trade data or you look at data on the geography of industrial economic 
innovative activities in a country is that as you move from the simple economic unit of the towns to 
more complex the cities or you move from countries that are relatively down in the development ladder to the 
that are at the top you have this subset structure in which diversity grows with the level of development 
complexity so that the places that do few things they not only do few things they do things that 
common to the places that do many things césar hidalgo you have this world in which creating that diversity 
difficult and those that have it are stuck not only with a primitive and limited offer but one that 
very redundant with everyone else very uncompetitive too these are also mechanisms that would actually help us explain part 
inequality because if what i can do is something that everybody can do and a few set of things 
hard for me to be competitive and have a decent income if i can do a lot of things 
nobody else can do and people want i think i have it made sean carroll when i think about 
of labor and maybe division of knowledge goes the same way i think about the industrial revolution i think 
henry ford building the model t in an assembly line and that too many questions to ask why hesitating 
how did that get started who invented that was that sort of a side product of other technological information 
like the printing press or is there a story to tell about how information brought upon itself césar hidalgo 
we have more of like a big history question here kind of like in that big history perspective i 
think that kind of like a long line of events but there are also some transitions that i think 
very important the first one that someone like yuval harari emphasizes quite a bit on sapiens is like the 
revolution like the development of language and some particular properties of language that we have because human languages are 
like animal communication systems we have the ability to talk about hypothetical things an ape can have the ability 
maybe tell another ape that danger or that a lion or a snake but they cannot tell them about 
idea for their new blockbuster film césar hidalgo that idea to talk about fiction was a big cognitive revolution 
happened years ago years ago and that is expressed in things like the development of advanced tools and an 
of our ability to accumulate knowledge and so forth then we have the agricultural revolution which people know about 
more reason about like years ago you know césar hidalgo much more reasonable like ten thousand years ago with 
we finally start accumulating slowly people into cities that incorporation is really important because at the end of the 
just like biology accumulates knowledge in dna and that knowledge has to be preserved and passed on to the 
generation we humans accumulate cultural knowledge and if we all disperse into small groups that we need to accumulate 
and ideas through generations is limited césar hidalgo but once we start forming cities we start living together going 
accumulate more knowledge going to have maybe also people that are going to be dedicated to those aspects of 
in the beginning maybe religious leaders and political leaders and so forth and in the next revolution i would 
in the sequence of events at least the way that i understand them is the writing revolution and that 
important in ancient greece even the writing is older than ancient greeks it was not that prevalent and it 
not that advanced it was much more based on accounting systems or even in administration and religious events césar 
but in ancient greece writing kind of explodes as a form of expression that is used to communicate and 
complex ideas and they go through something that could be considered similar to the renaissance that happened later they 
get close to maybe what could have been an industrial revolution maybe if history would have worked differently that 
revolution produces a lot of knowledge césar hidalgo and then after the writing revolution which i would date loosely 
seven hundred bc to me the next big revolution and what is the starting point of everything that is 
is the printing press because when gutenberg adapts the printing press that existed in asia and develops this removal 
printing press what happens are a lot of things first and this is all from elizabeth work the printing 
as an agent of change but first for the first time scientists and scholars have access to multiple books 
hidalgo before printing only kings had little libraries books were transcribed by hand and everybody has written a book 
realizes that no matter how cool your life is you have enough stories you have to read and share 
stories to fill up your books second what happens also is that printing is the first economic activity that 
urban and scalable think before printing what was the way in which you could make money that you could 
it big you had to have access to resources whether it is a lot of land and a lot 
serfs that would farm that land or you might have access to maybe mineral resources or you have looted 
town or something like that césar hidalgo but printing was something that you could produce in a city with 
relatively small team of people it was sort of ip intensive very ip intensive but if you have a 
that sold and you could sell copies you could become rich really quickly and evidence of that is that 
number of printers per capita in europe stabilized after only fifty years sean carroll so it went from zero 
sixty very quickly césar hidalgo yes yeah it was a huge economic boom in fifty years you stabilized that 
because you have an activity that basically was very profitable was very urban so it was the first time 
someone in the city can really start making it big by manufacturing something at scale really the first type 
mass production is printing sean carroll it was content as we would call it today right césar hidalgo yes 
carroll that was the point you had to monetize your content for the first time ever césar hidalgo yeah 
that i think is huge and it gives rise to a new cognitive revolution that we call enlightenment eventually 
involves a lot of the most important discoveries of science in the middle of the last millennia and after 
as society chugs along and the century comes along printing accelerates it takes two hundred years for people to 
that you can print short formats sean carroll okay césar hidalgo like magazines and pamphlets and so forth eventually 
lead to a change of institutions hard to understand the transition from monarchies to democracy without printing after those 
of institutions and with the acceleration of science and technology we develop new forms of communication like film and 
then television now the internet and i like to think of the history of our planet or of our 
thousands of years as a history of changes in communication technologies that have reconfigured the way that we create 
process information and that we generate and produce knowledge those are the eras to me have contributed to this 
history sean carroll yeah no very helpful because i guess we glossed over it a little bit but in 
book you certainly emphasize the fact that not only this thing called information but embodied crystallized césar hidalgo yeah 
carroll some stuff that carries the information and all these changes in communication technology which sound sort of mundane 
you put it that way new information flow technologies right and if you make it cheaper for information to 
you enable a lot of new things césar hidalgo huge and always laughed upon when they first emerge nobody 
twitter seriously and probably now is the first thing that politicians take seriously sean carroll you still complain about 
but yeah important césar hidalgo yeah quick for instance think of the music industry a lot of people are 
that musicians make money anymore but if you think about it from the perspective of communication technologies what is 
is that there was a short period of time in which they could make money because there were musicians 
the time of the ancient greek there are musicians still today but for most of history musicians only could 
live and live performance were hard to monetize they spread césar hidalgo but as technology evolved and you had 
and then more than radio you had then records those records allowed to constrain the diffusion of music in 
a way that you could monetize it because music was trapped on those discs it was trapped on those 
tapes and you could make a killing because the margin of cost of producing a new tape or a 
was very small you could sell them for and all of the musicians that were big in the and 
nowadays impossible to make money that way because music cannot be trapped in a physical media and what was 
is that musicians could make money for a while sean carroll so an interesting way to put it it 
to be sharable but not too sharable right césar hidalgo exactly yeah sean carroll that sweet spot i wonder 
lessons there are for other things i wonder if books are the same way certainly as someone who writes 
you probably feel the same way the first thing that happens when you write a book is pirated versions 
on the internet césar hidalgo exactly sean carroll not that better than the physical books so i think doing 
huge amount of damage interesting okay so that flow of information through different media obviously affects what people can 
but then where do we get to things like henry ford and you have this wonderful example in the 
of this giant plant never heard of it before but there was this what was it called césar hidalgo 
river rouge sean carroll river rouge yeah i know about this before but to this day that was the 
integrated facility césar hidalgo i know because been to china a lot and they have amazing stuff there sean 
but it grow monotonically there was a peak at that moment césar hidalgo yeah exactly so the river rouge 
this fantastic plant that ford created that literally took soy beans and metal on one end and produced cars 
of the other because it was a complete vertical integration i would say today we manufacture anything with that 
of vertical integration value chains are very distributed and international for instance why trumptards are stupid when it involves 
because the us value chain and automotive sector you know which is the number one country in the exports 
beer is also mexico because a lot of the inaudible beers manufacture so a lot of the value chains 
integrated and desegregated between different countries and we have those monolithic models césar hidalgo but at the time of 
ford where transportation was not that good why those slow cars were such a good business you needed maybe 
produce that level of vertical integration to be able to get the economies of scale that he needed to 
affordable vehicles nowadays things are different but impressive what they were able to do at some point sean carroll 
maybe a version of a sweet spot in that they had the differentiation of knowledge enough to do the 
to scale but it was still expensive to do things all over the place so bringing it together in 
same geographical location was a useful thing but i think in the book you had this example going to 
it but in chile you can mine copper and other raw materials and you would like to have a 
and you can in principle make them but actually cheapest to just send your raw materials to korea have 
make the batteries and then buy it back césar hidalgo yes so a good point because at the end 
the day for us to produce things you need to combine materials technology and knowledge the way that the 
works is that the world is kind of lazy basically we try to minimize cost a more economized way 
putting it but because of that you have to ask yourself the question what is easier to move is 
easier to move the knowledge is it easier to move the materials is it easier to move the technology 
are the factors that are easy to move and the hardest factor to move is knowledge sean carroll that 
weird knowledge is not very heavy but hard to move it from brain to brain i suppose césar hidalgo 
heavy because people tend to confuse knowledge with encoded pieces of information would you trust a brain surgeon that 
only thing that has done is read wikipedia pages about brain surgery and has never been there knowledge is 
experiential sean carroll or even read a textbook césar hidalgo exactly yeah someone that had just read a textbook 
brain surgery i allow them to operate and they why you have residencies and you have all of this 
systems but when it comes to complex industries the knowledge is embedded on large teams and that makes it 
hard to move knowledge has this temporary monopolies césar hidalgo for example when ford figures out how to build 
car and able to put all of that together on the river rouge and producing cars and other people 
cars also not that far from him not producing cars in san diego producing cars there in the midwest 
carroll still detroit yeah césar hidalgo exactly in detroit and it expands from there because knowledge is hard to 
so easier to bring the steel there easier to bring to coal and all of the other materials nowadays 
think the same silicone valley has monopolies over markets that they discovered china is now getting there because the 
that is very technological advanced and sophisticated the products are easier to move that the knowledge that you need 
make them césar hidalgo if you figure out something that people want going to have that monopoly because the 
is going to diffuse very quickly but the ability to make it is going to diffuse very slowly and 
it does going to be only a few people that are going to be able to supply that and 
going to have their day sean carroll and this is related to that distinction you draw between knowledge and 
how or explicit knowledge i guess and know how in some sense there are things you can put in 
book but there are things that are just in the human brain or just in the individual people and 
heavy because moving people is really hard césar hidalgo exactly so in the literature on knowledge that is used 
on business schools and knowledge economics information economics people make a strong distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge explicit 
is all of the knowledge that i can communicate through an act of communication i can qualify that knowledge 
the recipe that i can put in a cookbook is something that i could communicate through a page and 
is explicit knowledge césar hidalgo the experience of having cooked with the chefs from el bulli or any famous 
is something that is much harder to communicate so it would be considered tacit knowledge the best examples of 
knowledge are think of sports imaging michael jordan extremely talented he really knows how to handle a ball on 
basketball court but imagine you have a seminar and he speaks and tells you about basketball for three days 
much better of a player are you going to be after the third day sean carroll epsilon yeah césar 
not that much because that knowledge is tacit and it requires practice and the world is full of tacit 
and is the one that is hardest to see because not as obvious as the knowledge that we can 
sean carroll and closer to our experience i know if had a professional basketball in your career in your 
but graduate school is the same way students come in they know a lot of equations or whatever but 
know what it means to be a scientist they seen it in action they done it césar hidalgo i 
i came to the us for grad school and i had a very good advisor laszlo barabasi is a 
famous physicist that works on networks and so forth i remember soon i learned that it was a waste 
time to go to him to talk to him about technical details that you should figure out by yourself 
what i wanted to get out of him is understand when a problem is relevant how should i communicate 
people how is different people going to interpret this all of those type of things how to think about 
career and to connect the different things that you are doing and those are things that are hard to 
if you have a model of someone that knows how to do them and learning this on apprentice césar 
i think a lot of people sometimes understand that i think the you better get someone that is where 
want to be and be a very humble apprentice of them sean carroll if we take this on board 
we appreciate the importance of tacit knowledge and know how and how difficult it is to move around what 
the lessons that we get from that for either building an organization or organizing economy or trade barriers and 
like that césar hidalgo a lot of lessons because some big literature on this the literature that looks at 
geographic diffusion of knowledge and as you can imagine because knowledge is sticky a lot of barriers to the 
hard for knowledge to travel long distances now the reason why hard for knowledge to travel long distances is 
socially embedded actually that social networks are geographically circumscribed and that limits the diffusion of knowledge césar hidalgo then 
question is what are things that limit the ability of people to create links you have language barriers you 
cultural barriers all of those have been shown extensively to limit knowledge diffusion to limit trade to limit other 
the question then is now if a country or a city or a region that wants to develop their 
what trying to do is accumulate knowledge and the question is how do you do it by following the 
of knowledge diffusion sean carroll okay césar hidalgo and here are the examples of people that did it wrong 
examples of people that did things better examples of doing it wrong i know if ever heard of the 
of yachay in ecuador sean carroll no césar hidalgo earlier this decade raphael correa who was the president of 
decided to put a billion dollars on the creation of a new city of science and technology that he 
would compete with knowledge production centers across the world very idealistic plan a billion dollars in ecuador is of 
so a lot of cake and basically what they did is they grabbed a piece of agricultural land two 
north of quito and they tried to start building this university and city and industrial park and so forth 
hidalgo but if you walk around a place like kendall square in manhattan you know that you build a 
for a billion dollars and if you have to bring every brick and every person to lay bricks to 
place you build even less quickly the plan and rubble that university has gone through six or seven university 
by now they were able to attract a few scientists to move there that go well there was an 
in science talking about their experience and how some of them were leaving some of them got fired they 
a few students there at the beginning i think it was just a thousand that became very radicalized because 
believed in the dream césar hidalgo but a thousand dollars sorry a thousand students at a billion dollars a 
dollars per student so you could have put all of these kids in stanford for life there were basically 
this idea that if you had enough money you could create knowledge anywhere and not true because their process 
diffusion that constrained the creation of knowledge in the case of ecuador they had two chances one was called 
the other one was called quito which are the two centers where they have accumulated knowledge césar hidalgo what 
the channels that can promote knowledge diffusion one of them which is really important and also well documented is 
and migration is one channel that is also very biased toward the most talented people in the world a 
by bill kerr which is a professor at hbs that is called the gift of global talent and in 
book you find a lot of interesting facts one of them is people without college degree about of them 
people with a college degree about inventors that have filed a patent about nobel prize winners about nobel prize 
in the us since the is sixty something percent sean carroll yeah we get them all from everywhere césar 
exactly so you do have this thing that there is a tail of talent that is extremely global and 
is the one that helps create innovation the ones that help create jobs similar you get similar numbers if 
focus not only on formal education and academic credentials if you look at people that have formed fortune five 
companies or unicorns super biased towards foreigns so then one of the lessons that you need to do is 
do you attract that global talent because at the end of the day a game of global talent because 
these talented famous individuals are the ones that are going to help you attract other ones césar hidalgo the 
for a long time has had a huge advantage in that space it receives about of all of the 
that migrate in the world come only to one destination which is the us and now that sean carroll 
falling percentage i presume now césar hidalgo they changed sean carroll yeah césar hidalgo yeah sean carroll well a 
believable story i had two previous podcasts which made similar points one with geoffrey west about how things scale 
the ingenuity and creativity certainly scales with population density in some way and then another one with will wilkinson 
we talked about the political aspects of these and the openness to new ideas that was associated with cities 
more conservative rural divide sean carroll but then so that raises the question you brought up the word inequality 
great to attract the best talent and they want to be in these concentrations of brilliance and productivity but 
how do you spread the rewards of all that productivity and brilliance widely to everyone césar hidalgo so tough 
i do think that we have found out a few things quite recently actually without going into the details 
might go into this later but there are ways of measuring the knowledge intensity of economies like how much 
is there in new york vis a vie san diego tokyo moscow whatever and when you use those measures 
look at knowledge concentrations in cities or in countries you do find relationships with inequality as well césar hidalgo 
instance economies that are more complex tend to be less unequal economies that are more attractive and less complex 
economies that are more complex are less unequal sean carroll more equal césar hidalgo more equal exactly and economies 
are less complex are more unequal sean carroll okay not obvious to me césar hidalgo no not obvious but 
hard to have the level of inequality of switzerland with industrial structure of peru so if your exports are 
on three or four sectors mainly when those sectors are about mineral resources structured that are industries that are 
regimented and hierarchical because about safety about production not about creativity you want a miner to start digging anywhere 
getting creative sean carroll you want creativity down there césar hidalgo exactly so you have production structures that are 
geared toward innovation and geared towards a structure more hierarchical and unequal so at international scale as economies become 
complex they become more equal and as economies become less complex they become more unequal for countries like chile 
peru and angola all of these countries that depend a lot on mineral resource and structure whether these are 
fuels or other forms of minerals one thing that they need to do to reduce their inequality is they 
to sophisticate the structure so they can generate those middle income jobs because those middle income jobs are not 
to happen just through the redistributed policies césar hidalgo you do need policies and social safety nets but you 
need to change the practice structure now if you look inside countries the relationship flips which is kind of 
from a statistical perspective why that might be our hypothesis right now is that because within countries you do 
more special inaudible sean carroll okay césar hidalgo a lot of the facts that geoffrey west talks about are 
facts that are not just about the size of cities but also about the migration into cities peter hextrom 
a paper on science advances that finds that a lot of those super lenient scaling relationships described by west 
inaudible are actually quite explained by migrants coming to cities and those migrants being the most talented people so 
most talented people from the inaudible are the ones that migrate and help provide that extra punch of productivity 
cities have césar hidalgo a city like new york is very unequal not because only based on new yorkers 
a lot of poor people migrate to those places similar to san francisco big magnets and attractors of people 
at the country scale the more complex region or cities the more unequal it is the least complex the 
equal it is so you have a paradox not from homer simpson but the statistical simpson paradox that the 
that you serve at one scale inverts when you desegregate the data into the next scale sean carroll right 
so then the is there an immediate policy implication for this what are we going to do with this 
césar hidalgo i do think that there are a few things one thing that found also related to this 
that in the more complex economic activities concentrate in space much more than the least complex economic activities that 
is coming out on nature human behavior in a few weeks and what this tells us is that if 
the end of the day wealth is going to be increasingly be generated in cities we do need to 
better ways of including more people into cities because i think one of the pain points of the united 
right now is that the major cities of the us are failing to accommodate more people because of problems 
infrastructure problems in the ability to build and so forth césar hidalgo if you think about it san francisco 
carroll san francisco is the worst obviously césar hidalgo that city in china would be a twenty million people 
given what able to make but for that it would have twentyseven lines of subway that would be really 
and modern and autonomous it would need to have another type of infrastructure i know if been to shan 
sean carroll i have not been there but i know about it yeah césar hidalgo right shan gen is 
carroll it just came into existence from nothing césar hidalgo yeah exactly twentythree million people the us been able 
produce century mega cities it produced century mega cities but nowadays i think going to need to include more 
in the centers of production and if you get together good infrastructure for transportation you get together good ways 
densifying neighborhoods in a way that make them livable but at the same time are able to include maybe 
the number of people that they had before maybe three times going to start having more and more social 
because not sustainable to commute for three hours people are getting excluded because cities have the need to include 
people than the one that able to right now sean carroll yeah just to play advocate here probably mostly 
your side but these are subtle questions having this conversation in the middle of a char sean carroll inaudible 
having this conversation in the middle of a charming neighborhood of cambridge massachusetts with a lot of small individualsized 
or at least a few unit houses the character of the place would utterly change if the density were 
of a large chinese megalopolis right is that entirely good césar hidalgo well in some ways i live two 
away from here a huge privilege sean carroll yeah it is césar hidalgo a huge privilege sean carroll people 
to give it up césar hidalgo yeah many people in my company have to commute much longer and that 
is part of kind of like their unhappiness if you think about it a lot of the social unrest 
is happening in many countries being triggered when the price of gas goes up when the price of transportation 
up because commuters are unhappy commuters are the ones that are kind of like excluded and they have to 
of like make a journey every day to the places where people like me that have the privilege to 
able to afford a home here live i do think that if they could make cambridge more affordable to 
people i think it probably would be healthier maybe be able to hang out at night more and get 
ideas for our businesses and for creative activities that we want to do i do think that if you 
along with your neighbors good to have more of them sean carroll it is i was impressed to learn 
impressed but interested to learn that the average commute time goes up and up the more in a big 
césar hidalgo yes yes sean carroll despite the fact that things are more dense and nearby it takes longer 
get there just because even more césar hidalgo yes yeah yeah new york has huge commute times sean carroll 
and la crosstalk césar hidalgo we have all of that data we have data usa we have the main 
to distribute and visualize us public data that we launched in and there you can create maps of like 
times you immediately see that when you create the average travel time map boom all of the cities light 
when you create the commuting alone map then the opposite commuting alone is people driving cars in more rural 
average travel time goes up in places like dc and new york and so forth sean carroll well another 
of what you do if information flowing around in different forms and in different media is driving the economy 
various ways living in an era now where so much information that just dealing with it all is a 
issue been involved in data visualization and projects that try to sort of make sense of all this information 
what drives you to do that césar hidalgo it was a little bit of a say lucky path when 
started doing this work on economic complexity and relatedness there were like two big papers that we produced one 
two thousand seven that came out in science and another one in inaudible in those papers became very popular 
one of the things that those papers had was that they had some nontraditional techniques that we had invented 
you could use to predict the products that our country was going to export in the future that you 
use to predict the future economic growth potential of countries based on their economic structures i started to get 
lot of demand of people to generate reports on that type of topic as a scientist like you always 
to be working on the next thing sean carroll yes césar hidalgo they say yeah we want to do 
a relatedness and complexity analysis for these region of or for this or that that was kind of like 
repetitive work because sean carroll sure done that already césar hidalgo yeah done it when i started my lab 
mit the first grad student that i hired was alex simoes the job that i gave him is going 
do like a self service tool for this demand i had done something similar before for a paper in 
we looked at correlations between diseases using the hospitalization records and alex had started building this tool which became 
observatory of economic complexity now the number one tool to distribute international trade data in the world then we 
out that maybe like what people were more interested was on the platform and the tool rather than the 
that the tool made sean carroll crosstalk césar hidalgo that was redeployable then we created a tool together with 
government of minas gerais in brazil that integrated data for more than fifty million workers all of the basically 
sector economy of brazil data on trade on industries and employment and also education for all brazil then together 
a colleague from deloitte we started working on the creation of a similar platform for the us but one 
the things that we did there is that we realized that we needed to go beyond economic data and 
to include data on demographics on health on insurance on commute times on you name it and data usa 
was launched in that really became very popular and it became some sort of like the dream thing that 
in statistics departments of many governments in the world wanted to have that started to generate a demand to 
more projects like that data korea now there is data chile releasing data mexico on january been creating these 
that what they do is something that is very simple but not easy to do césar hidalgo easy to 
but hard to do is to integrate thirty different datasets but not just provide files but integrate them into 
what we do is we transform data into stories the main form of integration that we provide that allows 
to find the data on the web the stories have text that is generated semialgorithmically using the data visualizations 
imagine for the us the us has like census designated places each one of them has a complete profile 
more than seventy visualizations and a lot of text and information even if you had a little town you 
all of your census data and your ba data and your bls data in data usa then we have 
advanced tools like ways to integrate data and download it but integrating data from multiple sources ways of creating 
visualizations that has been something that has done very well also done similar solution for private sector companies in 
we integrate the data from their marketing departments and logistics and so forth to create platforms that people can 
in a strategic decision making sean carroll are these also useful for academics doing studies of demography or whatever 
hidalgo yeah they use it a lot just to give you an idea right now on our online properties 
get over a million people a month we run service to try to figure out who they are and 
we can serve them better a platform like data usa thirtyfive to of the people that visit it like 
of some form whether it is like a high school student doing a homework or whether it is a 
professor using it in some report if you go to google scholar and you search for the url it 
be a relatively wellcited paper sean carroll right césar hidalgo unfortunately you get credit for those ones maybe one 
going to be able to put your websites on google scholar as well but another story we do get 
from academia we do get a lot of people from local governments sean carroll can people just go to 
website and use it is it a feeforservice or césar hidalgo no totally free right now thinking maybe in 
future to add some premium features for like people that are using this some people use it for example 
do market analysis we could provide like premium features in that case but so far completely free open source 
very open project sean carroll is that similar to you also mentioned offhandedly the urban perception the idea of 
actual photographs of different places in the city to sort of but not just show them in a slideshow 
learn about them from the computer césar hidalgo yeah related because if you see what interested in interested on 
of like these applications of science and technology to society one of the things that i tried to do 
the last decade is to find alternative ways to collect data and hopefully data about aspects of society that 
been hard to quantify before in i got the idea that we could use google street view images to 
evaluative aspects of cities which place looks safe which place look lively which place look depressing beautiful and so 
at that time a lot of people were like this is crazy these are all subjective things you are 
going to be able to do it all but i discovered that on the one hand there was a 
inaudible of people that have attempted and had done that many times but with very very small sample sizes 
both images and people césar hidalgo what i did is i did a crowdsourcing study that quickly became the 
dataset ever of visual perception service that was called place pulse that allows us to classify images and we 
over people rating them we discovered a few things first that preferences were very transitive sean carroll oh okay 
hidalgo yeah so not that all over the place if i show you like a picture of a really 
like beautiful wellkept neighborhood and i show you like a picture of like a very sketchy favela industrial like 
tend to say answer that the first one is safer than the second one that tends to be quite 
universal preference sean carroll right césar hidalgo the difference between images is so large that it overwhelms the differences 
people we could use those scores to like measure like the segregation sean carroll but you know if actually 
all you know is that everyone perceives it to be safe or unsafe césar hidalgo yeah we expect it 
be because like what we wanted to measure was the perception because perception can also have an effect that 
independent of whether that location is actually safe or not sean carroll right yeah césar hidalgo different things they 
to be the same actually sean carroll i mean all been in cities in neighborhoods where said this looks 
this look articulating why saying that might be difficult césar hidalgo exactly what we discovered though is that crowdsourcing 
very limited for the amount of data that we needed to collect a city like new york manhattan alone 
about street segments a lot of street segments say you want to get one image per street segment and 
want to evaluate that image and say that you want to compare that image with only ten others to 
able to get a decent score imagine like college football but with like teams and ten games sean carroll 
play every team right yeah césar hidalgo exactly super underdetermined matrix still you need a lot of traffic just 
evaluate all of those images for one city and one dimension what we decided to do is to say 
the data that we have and train computer vision algorithms to like do the clicking for us we find 
actually those computer algorithms work very well they allowed us to scale to create inaudible perceptual maps with hundreds 
thousands of images then we could use that to study how perception affected behavior sean carroll okay what did 
find césar hidalgo we teamed up with a team of italian colleagues that had mobile phone data and they 
see the activity of people in cities as a function of the time of the day then we could 
if people tended to avoid unsafe looking places controlling for distance to the subway for distance to the central 
district for other things like the density of jobs the density of population and so forth we did find 
interesting effects first we find that like people tend to avoid unsafe looking places after controlling for all those 
you find less people in those places than you would expect those effects are modulated by demographics stronger for 
and for the elderly but reversed for people below young people tend to like hang out in the unsafelooking 
sean carroll they hang out in those areas yeah césar hidalgo young male especially but like elderly women tend 
avoid those places it kind of like makes sense but it helped formalize something that i think we all 
an intuition for but now we actually have like hardcore data to be able to show it sean carroll 
mean another example of what we were talking about a different way of thinking about conceptualizing a different kind 
information in some sense or at least a different way of sharing it and thinking about it the other 
last thing i wanted to ask you about was how this relates to your interest in collective memory i 
have one podcast guest lynne kelly who studies memory palaces ancient memory palaces the idea of remembering things by 
them with physical geographical locations she thinks that stonehenge for example was used as a way of remembering what 
would call knowhow crosstalk knowledge that was because they have writing they pass it down that easily but nowadays 
have the internet we have books we have tv a very different kind of thing how is our collective 
of who we are and what kinds of things we pay attention to been affected by these technological changes 
hidalgo yeah i was studying how collective memory is affected by technology language and time we did a paper 
steve pinker and other people in which we looked at the network of global languages a network in which 
node is a language and language are connected if likely to be translated or spoken by the same people 
english might be connected to german if a lot of books get translated from one language to another and 
lot of people that speak german also speak english and so forth we mapped that network using three datasets 
dataset with over two million book translations twitter we detected the language of tweets and then if you tweet 
english and you tweet in spanish i can connect those two languages because you are expressing knowledge of both 
wikipedia edits not reading wikipedia but if you edited the page of einstein in german and you edited the 
of einstein in english you probably know how to write in german so you probably know both languages césar 
interestingly enough when we compare that network with a dataset that we created of globally famous people we found 
the centrality of a language in that network explained the number of famous people produced by the language better 
the population of the language better than the wealth of that language that tells us hey like fame or 
fame is something that is very much dependent on like this network because if you think about it the 
of languages is like the most aggregate version of the global social network that you can have you cannot 
a social relationship if you speak a language you cannot make a friend just by nodding in that context 
learned that much of what the world knows is going to be modulated by this network a lot of 
about that sean carroll just to be clear does the network take the form of saying things like if 
know english more likely to know french than chinese whereas if you know chinese more likely to know korean 
to know english things like that césar hidalgo exactly yeah the network gathers all those things there are paths 
every language and every language but a language like english for instance is a global hub someone from portugal 
somewhere from vietnam probably going to speak something the most likely thing is going to speak english sean carroll 
a bad example césar hidalgo but also like regional hubs for example french connects a lot with african languages 
spanish connects with like quechua and mapudungun and other languages from native south america then you have also arabic 
being as an original halfchinese then you have language like russia a very important regional half on all like 
europe and in northeast asia then you have very peripheral languages a very hierarchical network with like english is 
the center then a ring of regional hubs and then like smaller languages that are kind of like on 
periphery connected to some of those regional hubs sean carroll i would love to see a picture of this 
there an image out there on the internet somewhere césar hidalgo yeah yeah yeah languagemediamitedu sean carroll all right 
good thanks césar hidalgo then we also studied how communication technologies affected our collective memory we used this dataset 
created of over famous biographies to look at how changes in technology change the number of globally famous people 
were born each year and the occupations associated to those people for instance when you think of einstein he 
be a physicist when you think of michelangelo he would be a painter what you find is that when 
communication technologies were introduced the composition of our collective memory changed not only the size before printing you look 
the matrix of our collective memory and mostly political and religious leaders after printing sean carroll okay bosses of 
one way or the other césar hidalgo exactly after printing you get famous artists and famous scientists for the 
time you get a lot of painters you get composers you start getting astronomers sean carroll writers césar hidalgo 
also there but then there is the second printing era which we talked before when people started doing like 
formats and so forth there you have an explosion on the sciences then now you start differentiating natural philosophy 
more sciences you get a lot of famous writers and so forth and composers then you have the invention 
film and radio that generates a huge shift on the arts because before that it was the painter and 
composer then about the performer sean carroll right césar hidalgo the musician the singer composers disappeared musicians and singers 
the ones that now become famous actors become famous not play writers anymore kind of like that shift then 
have the introduction of television with television you create the fame of sportsmen because sportsmen were not that famous 
before television sean carroll crosstalk performer yeah césar hidalgo a live performance it has to be at the right 
when you watch the game sean carroll and visible and and you can experience it there yeah okay césar 
exactly you do have kind of like that change in the composition of our collective memory with introduction of 
technologies very clear to me now when i think about like history i think about like the modern times 
the renaissance and the things that i learned in school i think of it in terms of like okay 
was the dominant communication technology at the time the era that i set myself in sean carroll going to 
next césar hidalgo the next thing that i sean carroll instagram influencers césar hidalgo next on that what is 
you know tiktok sean carroll i know of it never used it yet far behind césar hidalgo oh dude 
need an account to watch sean carroll oh okay césar hidalgo that already tells you something massive i think 
different ways first is like the quality of the performance that served there very good the amount of attention 
that is on tiktok amazing like all of these videos getting like millions and millions and millions of likes 
like a marginal traffic sean carroll right césar hidalgo huge the first global social media because a chinese company 
only social media that is popular in both china and the west which makes it quite interesting as a 
phenomenon not based on peer communication actually broadcasting sean carroll oh okay césar hidalgo in tiktok you have like 
channels the for you which is like a tv feed in which you just scroll and the following which 
the people that following and you have a feed of who you follow it you can search the search 
horrible it work like it provide good results very passive like television they reinvented television for the phone era 
a zapping world in which like content is thirty seconds long those fifteen to thirty seconds a lot of 
quality content at that range of size sean carroll i mean twitter and podcasts are as cutting edge as 
to get i think technologically but they keep coming along very quickly yeah i guess the point is that 
we think about ourselves changes when these media change how we remember ourselves césar hidalgo indeed what i want 
say about tiktok though that i like which is interesting i do think that more social and more family 
i use twitter i use it by myself when i use facebook by myself when i watch tiktok in 
couch with my wife and my daughter and the three of us are looking at the same screen at 
same time and talking about what watching i do think that important because we do have a lot of 
right now in which people are interacting with screens independently i grew up probably you grew up with people 
in front of a television and having that more of as a collective experience in which you have to 
what you watch you have to talk about what you watch i do find that a good thing compared 
like the social media that has been more peertopeer but isolating sean carroll well i like to end on 
notes is that your optimistic note what do you think about the future what should our optimism be where 
it be located césar hidalgo an optimist i know a good thing or a bad thing sean carroll yeah 
know césar hidalgo i think maybe genetics but i tend to be optimistic even though like today chile is 
through a very difficult moment with all of the things that have happened there during the last four or 
days but i do think that at the end of the day the positive things in life tend to 
up and build on each other better than the negative things in life going back to the beginning we 
about where information and order grows and because our ability to create order and complexity is larger than the 
at which getting destroyed i think also true for many of the positive things i am an optimist because 
do think that at the end of the day things add up better as we move along sean carroll 
right césar hidalgo thanks for some good information there thanks for being on the podcast césar hidalgo hey my 
sean get some help with the sound quality i have notgreat internet so i download first but even that 
it is so choppy can hardly get through it it seems worse this week hidalgo but it has been 
problem for a while thanks peter i am curious if césar has read book new kind of excellent guest 
someone explain whether there is a direct correlation between the information associated with entropy early univere low entropy and 
information and the information associated with quantum mechanics particles and qbits are the same whether information can only exist 
it is known when it is knowledge thanks gerry should be in the transcripts comments are closed sean carroll 
conversations with the worlds most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts and ideas
