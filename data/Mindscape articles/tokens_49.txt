show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and as 
be becoming clear through the various topics of the podcast one of the things fascinated by is the boundary 
living and not quite living by which i mean artificial life artificial synthetic intelligence robots all the different ways 
which we can build the things that have some lifelike qualities but yet really alive and on the other 
how living things are manifestations of underlying physical processes sc so today going to be talking to kate adamala 
is an assistant professor of genetics cell biology and development at the university of minnesota and kate is involved 
building synthetic life building individual cells from scratch this is something this is a field artificial life synthetic biology 
has a bunch of successes and controversies to its name different things you can do so famously craig venter 
in the news years ago roughly ten years ago now for building the first artificial organism which was a 
accomplishment but what really happened was he took a preexisting bacterial cell removed its genome and replaced it with 
genome that he had synthesized he and his team of course had synthesized they had written a new dna 
and that booted up inside the cell and got it going but it clearly starting from scratch sc so 
and her collaborators are among a group of people who are trying to literally build cells from scratch the 
wall all the internal workings and so forth we yet have a working artificial cell that is truly alive 
the sense that it reproduces it goes its own way but in some sense better as we learn in 
conversation we can tune proto cells to do things that are useful to us without worrying about them reproducing 
much and going crazy and taking over the world so kate is a member of a large collaboration called 
where we are working toward this goal of actually creating a selfsustaining cell all by itself from purely synthetic 
and what we will be able to do with that the prospects the frontiers for the future here are 
amazing to me at very beginning of a revolution in this kind of thing and an extremely articulate spokesperson 
this kind of work so this is definitely a fun mindbending and you know slightly provocative kind of podcast 
go music sc kate adamala welcome to the mindscape podcast kate adamala thank you great to be here sc 
you know as someone who has done cosmology in my life i sometimes get accused of playing god thinking 
the universe all at once and so very happy to be here with someone who creates life in their 
way closer to playing god than i ever will be ka we are trying we are not as good 
the original god must have been but trying to get there sc so is it fair to say that 
of your goals in the lab is to create life from scratch ka from nonliving components the definition of 
is flexible some people say to really start from scratch you have to start from inorganic molecules and guide 
chemical evolution all the way to a living system this is not what doing cheating big time taking existing 
complex bioorganic molecules and enzymes and trying to put them together into something that resembles a living system sc 
so you are using the fact that life already exists and helpful and so going to take guidance why 
like you said god did it right the first time so you ka i know if he did it 
but he definitely did it trying to improve on it sc and how did you get into this are 
a biologist by training ka no actually a chemist by training and my approach to it is chemical i 
life is just complex chemistry and i would like to be able to reconstitute it using principles of chemical 
and i got into it because i always thought kinda cool laughter i mean growing up when you watch 
those science fiction movies they always have an astrobiologist on a spaceship and one day i realized that this 
actually a job one can do so i went and started doing it and it was great sc so 
up a little bit i mean if you are making life from scratch then it really makes you need 
think about the question of what life is the definition right and in my book the big picture i 
the famous nasa definition of life and i said i like this definition ka i like it either sc 
tell us what it is and then why you like it ka so the nasa definition of life is 
chemical system capable of darwinian evolution and i like that definition but the best one we have the main 
why i like it is because not a functional experimentally verifiable definition so when we go out and drill 
the ice of europa are we going to find some organic soup the nasa definition of life is not 
to help us to define whether there is life on europa or not same for mars same for enceladus 
great definition for philosophers but not a practical definition that we can use when we get our hands on 
sample sc well yeah the part i like was the darwinian evolution part i mean something that life as 
know it clearly involves but if i made a molecule by molecule replica of a living being except include 
reproductive capacities it would still be alive right ka a very good point too for example not alive myself 
i cannot undergo darwinian evolution myself sc there you go and chosen not to so maybe not alive either 
ka exactly the problem with definitions of life is that as soon as you come up with one you 
find an exception that fit it sc do we need to have a definition is that an important thing 
we need to have a working definition because we will have samples from other planets and they will contain 
we know that the universe is lousy with organics organic matter just gets formed abiotically sc what do you 
when you say the word organics ka anything carbonbased anything that resembles organic molecules known on earth we know 
can find amino acids nucleotides lipids we are finding them spectrophotometrically in interstellar clouds we know there will be 
like that on pretty much any surface that can support liquid water in the universe sc yeah i think 
some nonscientists can get confused by this because they think that the word organic is like organic food like 
made naturally and stuff like that or at the very least has something to do with life but chemists 
that organic is just anything that has a carbon atom in it ka yup pesticides are organic believe it 
not sc yeah chuckle ka yeah by organic i mean not a biotic molecule just an organic molecule in 
organic chemistry since sc but it was certainly amazing to me when i learned that you can find not 
organic molecules but several of the molecules that are very relevant to life are literally out there in interstellar 
ka absolutely there are amino acids out there there are nucleobases out there there are probably sugars out there 
and this does not mean that living beings out there ka that does not mean there are living beings 
there and the problem of lack of a functional definition of life finding building blocks of life so you 
say that if i go out to mars and find amino acids that means life on mars sc okay 
if i go out to mars and find the right sterile chemistry terrestrial amino acid that just means contaminated 
which we probably did anyway by now sc do you think we did ka oh totally sc we nasa 
very hard not to contaminate ka they also try very hard not to crash on landing and sc yeah 
ka the track record is not in their favor so i think we contaminated mars the question is whether 
we dragged out there would survive or not and also there are probably still environments on mars that we 
to not contaminate and it would be nice to keep it that way but i have high hopes we 
also contaminated the moon with all the crap we crashed there but we have not yet had a chance 
contaminate neither europa nor enceladus and these are the very likely candidates for places where there could be life 
least in our solar system sc so this is jumping ahead but perfectly okay so you think that the 
of jupiter and saturn are better places right now to look for life than mars ka i think we 
should look because mars is the only other planet that had conditions that closely resembled earth before mars lost 
water and atmosphere it was habitable by our definition of habitable like human definition of habitable so if there 
a probiotic evolution that could lead to the origin of terrestriallike living beings that could have happened on mars 
more likely on mars really than ka definitely sc yeah ka another problem though is that earth is spreading 
as we speak always shedding atmosphere and that atmosphere contains spores and we know that those can travel so 
we find a tardigrade on mars or more likely a tardigrade spore on mars that mean tardigrades originated on 
independently sc no amazing to me also space is amazing to me you can find meteorites here on earth 
came from volcanoes on mars right and the planets share material with each other ka galaxies planetary systems even 
galaxies share material with each other so i guess another reason why we need a functional definition of life 
if we find a system that resembles something we would expect life to look like we right now we 
a good definition to say if it actually is alive or not but we know find stuff because stuff 
being shed all over and i guess life is just very promiscuous at spreading everywhere sc but is it 
that the definition is less important than a list of characteristics and we can find things with some characteristics 
not others ka and i think where the field is going right now people are starting to agree that 
can make a experimentally trackable list of characteristics and if we find something that fits some of those then 
really happy sc so what would what would be on your personal list of characteristics that you would call 
of lifey ka i like homeostasis sc oh homeostasis ka maintaining internal environment that is different significantly different in 
of molecules ions ph and whatnot to the external environment and ability to maintain it actively so not just 
different than an environment but actually work for it and homeostasis to me sc good so separate from your 
and not just because a locked room and things inside you but interacting with the environment in some way 
yet maintaining your difference ka yes sc okay ka to me the biggest hallmark of a living system replication 
important actually a big fan of darwinian evolution for the living system i mean for a living system as 
whole i know of any better way to evolve than a darwinian evolution and every individual organism does not 
does not have to undergo darwinian evolution sc sure but i think yeah the people who want that to 
the definition say okay but the species has to do or something like that the fact that you and 
do not have children is not going to stop us from being alive ka exactly sc members of our 
do chuckle ka exactly and to me another very important property and then another property that i have a 
time defining and i quite understand it myself but i really like it is the complexity so basically there 
a certain threshold of complexity of molecules and the ways molecules interact with each other that only finding in 
systems on earth and not in nonliving and that complexity is very hard to measure but once you measure 
and you plot it complexity versus whatever other function of aliveness you want to name a very clear boundary 
life and nonlife is how complex you are we as life are just insanely complex and we understand what 
of what we are come as those emergent properties of complex molecules interacting with each other and to me 
is a hallmark of life but a really terrible definition because not sc a little vague ka very vague 
not experimentally trackable at this point sc and obviously i mean not obviously but i will certainly buy the 
that every example we know of life is extremely complex but making another interesting point that no examples of 
that are that complex ka yes sc so actually a dividing line if only we could sort of formalize 
we meant ka yeah exactly sc and okay but sort of features of life as we know it like 
and so forth but i like that being little bit more general than that so we often people say 
but is that tied up with your idea of homeostasis ka to me personally yes a lipid bilayer person 
i wrote for bilayers all over the universe i would like to find them but there are other ways 
maintaining compartmentalization without a cell membrane so i think compartmentalization is necessary because you need to separate yourself from 
environment but it necessarily have to be a cell membrane sc well good this is one of the questions 
i had coming in and familiar with life as we know it of course is it safe to say 
all life as we know it is in the form of cells or multicellular organisms ka yes sc like 
virus is maybe always a sticking point ka i would not consider viruses alive and even if you do 
them alive they still need crap inside a membrane to live because they have to impact the cell to 
sc okay and so obvious why that would be helpful if you want to maintain this complexity and so 
seal yourself off so a cell membrane around your inner workings and on the outside but because many examples 
the history of science where scientists guessed one way and it turned out to be wrong are we really 
you have something like life without membranes at all ka oh we totally could we need a compartment but 
compartment have to be a membrane at all the compartment could be peptide it could be any other polymer 
compartment could even be a physical containment for example a piece of rock with little cavities all over and 
of those cavities could have its own distinct environment sc and some people even proposed things like that as 
origin of life ka yes sc right yeah but i guess when i meant membrane i was thinking as 
nonbiologist like any compartment but could we even have noncompartmentalized life just life sort of in a network that 
different parts spread over some environment ka not impossible but everything we know another problem everything we know about 
of life is derived from this sample size that equals one chuckle ka and stupid because as scientists we 
at least a triplicate give me two more life forms and i can tell you more about properties of 
right now we only have one life form so looking at everything that life form does we absolutely need 
compartment and the current going knowledge based on all the data we have i would say not impossible to 
a noncompartmentalized life but it would have a lot of problems that would have to be solved one way 
another sc when we say we have one example we have many organisms but they all came from ka 
sc same original organism ka on the biochemical level life terrestrial life is kind of boring because not much 
everyone has the same kind of metabolism everyone uses the same few hundred molecules to do life to do 
basic process of life so yes we have incredible diversity in anatomy and physiology but if you look at 
biochemical level everyone does dnarna proteins everyone uses this crappy catalyst called the ribosome to make proteins chuckle ka 
that much variety sc not a lot of cleverness in the engineering ka cleverness for sure but not enough 
sc not of variety i should say yeah okay ka so we generalize we cannot say life as a 
biochemical phenomenon does this or that because we just simply know it because we only have one life right 
to study sc and i really got into the whole idea of the bilipid membranes is ka lipid bilayers 
lipid bilayers ka bilayers because they have two leaflets sc so tell me what a lipid is talk about 
hydrophilia and the hydrophobia and all that stuff because amazing to me ka so yeah lipids are really cool 
a lipid has a tail and a head sc lipid is a molecule ka yes lipid is a molecule 
it has to to be classified as a lipid it has to have a tail and a head and 
head is polar which makes it hydrophilic and the tail is nonpolar which makes it hydrophobic sc so liking 
or hating water ka liking water and hating water so head loves water tail hates water so now drop 
in water what happens is heads get all happy because water around so they stick their heads into the 
tails hate water so what are they going to do going to snuggle other tails and how a membrane 
formed the tails do not like to be around water so the tails face each other and the heads 
out the problem is if you have tails facing each other they still have the problem of the fact 
there is water at the end of them so they solve that problem by inviting other tails to back 
up so imagine two trucks backing up into each other the backs of the trucks are facing each other 
the fronts of the trucks are facing outside so the front likes water two fronts like water and stare 
the water and that makes the membrane the inside of the membrane can hide all this hydrophilicity inside it 
an incredibly stable conformation they really hate to not do that why membranes form spontaneously when you drop lipids 
water sc yeah the other nice thing is is pretty easy to make then right because they just happen 
they just happen exactly and why a big fan of lipids because we know lipids can be synthesized abiotically 
there were lipids around even before there was life around and once you have lipids you are going to 
bilayer membranes and once you have bilayer membranes they like to be spherical sc another amazing thing right ka 
not healthy for a membrane to be flat it wants to be spherical basically like a soap bubble membranes 
essentially soap bubbles so if you make a soap bubble you cannot make a flat open soap bubble when 
make a soap bubble it ends up being a sphere whether you want it or not and what lipid 
do they end up being spheres and then once you have that sphere you can put stuff inside and 
living sc yeah so these lipids very naturally give us a way to compartmentalize ka yes sc are there 
ways besides lipids ka you can make protein compartments and we do we as life do you can make 
that are amorphous there are those awesome proteins that are called intrinsically disordered proteins that can undergo face change 
change transition depending on external environment and we actually have them we have those membraneless organelles in our cytoplasm 
create just kind of islands of different chemical composition just because they want to like property of those molecules 
a way to compartmentalize things you can also use completely different kind of molecules you could imagine sugars making 
sort of a compartment you could imagine other polymers making some sort of a compartment or you can imagine 
rocks making a compartment sc okay but most life as we know it cells the membranes of the cells 
made of these ka all life as we know it uses lipids in their bilayers sc so on the 
hand easy to make but on the other hand not completely watertight right some things can come in and 
which is important to being a living organism ka yes yes and the really good ones highly evolved i 
by highly i mean bacteria and above evolved life has pretty watertight membranes to get anything across the membrane 
need memory channels and actually really good because then you have control over what goes across your membrane you 
your channels sc so in some sense the cell is like a little island and there are these bridges 
the ka yes and they have control over those bridges sc yeah border patrols letting some things in and 
ka yes yup sc so you can see how things are beginning to get a bit more complicated yeah 
one of the problems when you think about the origin of life is a good membrane will not be 
permeable so life had to pretty early figure out how to get stuff across the membrane using membrane channels 
transporters sc right okay so we have compartmentalization my impression is in the origin of life community among the 
of life compartmentalization is sort of the easiest one to understand how it could have gotten going is that 
ka yes the one that we made a lot of progress on sc yeah ka experimentally it sounds but 
these are one of the toughest projects to run because lipids they do form those liposomes if you want 
to but actually working with them handling them is kind of a pain in the lower back all been 
through grad school so to me not that incredibly hard because i was just trained to do it but 
the great scheme of things there a lot of other experiments are easier but the origins field made great 
in making those compartments sc good and then the other things we mentioned were the need to be able 
replicate and you need some sort of engine inside you right you need some metabolism ka yes sc so 
i think of what life is it has those three aspects of compartmentalization metabolism and replication is that fair 
i oversimplifying ka no definitely fair definitely oversimplified but also fair sc yeah and what qualifies exactly as metabolism 
this is where i get into physics right life uses fuel it uses the low entropy energy from its 
one way or another ka the worst person to ask about it because i think of it from the 
functional point of view to me metabolism is taking simple building blocks and making something different and more complex 
of it and that ties very strongly to maintaining homeostasis basically your environment has a certain chemical composition your 
have different chemical composition if you want to do life you have to take stuff from your environment and 
it so it makes the inside of you so basically your environment has something that look like you and 
reason you have metabolism is because that basically means you have machinery to take something that is not you 
make it into you and the easiest definition of metabolism to me at least is that processing building blocks 
look like end result and making it end result the end result being you in this case sc fascinating 
me because this is definitely a field where a lot of things that have the character of know it 
we see chuckle ka oh absolutely sc metabolism and then still searching for the precise definitions ka absolutely and 
again hampered by the fact that we have anything to compare with we only have we only know one 
of doing metabolism because we only know one life form if we had a few other to look at 
could try to generalize more sc and that one way we have is the story of atp and things 
that we have little batteries basically little fuel storage services inside ourselves ka yup and all made by one 
everybody uses atp so sc yeah chuckle ka kinda hard to generalize sc a monopoly ka yeah totally is 
sc and is as a cosmologist i want to ask or as someone who has been involved in debates 
the fine tuning of the universe is or would it ever be clear that this is simply the best 
to do it rather than just some accident of history that chemistry happened to make use of ka it 
be clear once we find completely independent life forms if we find say twentyseven different life forms all over 
universe and they all use atp then definitely something about atp but i think there is anything special about 
i think it just happened to be around and we started using it sc okay good so the other 
thing then is on the replication side we use dna right ka mmhmm sc dna and rna are both 
and then like you said the ribosome tells the rna or actually takes the rna in and make proteins 
yes sc is that a fair way to say it right and this also seems very specific i know 
of mine who what they do for a living is they build little computers and robots out of dna 
my first guess was that that was because dna is all over the place we know about it from 
living beings but it was explained to me that forget about living beings dna is a really good information 
mechanism ka it is a great information storage mechanism but definitely not the only one you can imagine and 
are two parts to dna one is the back bone which is what gives it stability and flexibility and 
i think might be one of the more common ways of doing it if i were to bet how 
twentyseven random life forms all over the universe would look like i would not be surprised for them to 
something that resembles the backbone of our dna but then the information is actually starting nucleobases those forward dna 
and these i think are relatively random you can imagine different kinds of nucleobases that could easily do the 
thing sc right and this weird thing that there are four different nucleobases and they appear in groups of 
so four x four x four is right so sixtyfour different possibilities and we use all of them but 
kind of a redundant coding scheme only sort of twenty of the categories that we actually make use of 
that right ka yeah sc okay ka stop sc oh yeah one the period at the end of the 
ka yes sc you need that right okay and so not sure or suspecting that this choice for nucleobases 
very very different ka if you tell me you can run a probiotic evolution on earth over and over 
ten times i would say all of those ten times we would end up with an information storage polymer 
would have slightly different nucleobases many different types of nucleobases that could work chemically to do sc is that 
that synthetic life researchers are looking into could they improve on dna chuckle ka it necessarily be improving you 
think most of the other choices actually improve dna is great because just stable enough its base pair is 
enough to be solid when you need it but then when you need to unwind it it hold on 
dear life it actually is willing to let go and people have built experimental systems that use different nucleobases 
it works sc okay good to know a slightly more radical question is dna is or something dnalike the 
of a chain of bases or molecules that store information in a onedimensional chain it sounds pretty robust the 
way i could think to generalize that would be what about a twodimensional sheet could we imagine genetic information 
stored in some sort of twodimensional pattern and could that be more complicated or efficient but just hard to 
off the ground in early life ka this would probably work but then your cells would have to be 
chuckle sc a synthetic biologist you can make that happen chuckle ka there are actual physical chemical limitations on 
size of a cell if you have too much surface spending too much time working on that surface and 
problem sc so there are basic laws of physics chemistry etcetera in the environment we have ka yes sc 
it may be in very different environments the conditions look very different ka yes sc okay good to know 
mark it down that we talked about that here if we discover it on europa or something like that 
for example if a rockbased life you could imagine twodimensional system you could imagine most of the chemistry happening 
a twodimensional sc okay alright and so ka pancake life sc pancake life yes mmm pancakes so we have 
basic ingredients i think that it behooves us as scientists to try to think beyond these obvious things like 
say our imaginations are poisoned by the fact that we have this one example but it does also seem 
sensible that compartmentalization metabolism and replication will be essentially universal in life so how close have we come to 
that ourselves to being engineers as well as chemists and biologists ka that depends who you ask sc what 
we done let me put it that way the other way around i think a lot of sort of 
of time arguing over who made an artificial life heard news reports and things like that but put it 
way what have we done what steps have we made along the way ka made the biggest progress on 
we can recreate artificially compartments that look like living compartments we can make pretty good metabolism inside them so 
can put together molecules that make proteins that uptake nutrients from the environment we suck at replication still that 
has not been solved we are unable to recreate a autonomous spontaneous replication system we can replicate those compartments 
hand we can force them to replicate but we cannot design them in a way that they will be 
to replicate out of their own desire as a result of the biochemical processes happening inside them we made 
progress on homeostasis we can make those little synthetic cell compartments that actively maintain their composition that is different 
the composition of the outside sc pretty good ka not as robust but nowhere nearly as robust as living 
but again kind of lame attempts at recreating living systems so they be as robust sc and i do 
this recollection that there have been experiments where you tried to make either rna or the equivalent of rna 
would reproduce itself we get yet have an example of synthetic single molecules that reproduce themselves right ka no 
yet sc we mentioned this earlier but of course when we say reproduction things like fire reproduce themselves or 
reproduce themselves but now talking about reproduction with information storage is the crucial thing why rna is so good 
yeah rna and dna and all the other nas sc yeah okay okay we explain to us what heard 
the news there was several years ago we heard the craig venter made artificial life but it all depends 
what you mean so forget about whether he made artificial life or not what did he do ka he 
a bacteria called mycoplasma which is the smallest known independently living cell parasites but they live outside of cells 
they took that cell they took the genome of that cell and they bombarded it with pieces of dna 
randomly insert random dna sequences all over the genome called transposon insertion so basically you force cells to uptake 
and put it wherever in their genome now what happens is if you put this random piece of dna 
in your genome you can be lucky and put it somewhere where not going to kill you or you 
put it inside a gene that you absolutely have to have to live and then you just end up 
sc yeah ka so what they did and then they grew a whole bunch of those mutant bacteria they 
it all and they found that there is a lot of genes that you can shut off that you 
insert those random pieces of dna into and the cell survives it might not be as healthy it might 
be as happy it might not divide as quickly but it will be alive and so that way they 
out which genes are absolutely essential for survival and which are not and they removed all of those genes 
were not essential for survival and they came up with this minimal genome so that was the first step 
actually minimized an already smallest living organism ka now then next thing is they actually synthesized that whole genome 
that sounds easy right now in the age of twist and other high throughput dna synthesis but back then 
they were doing it ten years ago that was a huge deal to actually synthesize the entire genome of 
living organism and they did it then how do you make it to be actually alive is you take 
synthetic genome that dna was synthesized on a machine and had never been alive and you put it inside 
cytoplasm of another living cell they picked a cell that was very closely related to what they started with 
picked another species of a mycoplasma a slightly bigger and just slightly more complex and they developed this procedure 
genome transplantation where they take the synthetic dna put it inside a living cell and that synthetic dna takes 
the natural dna that came with that living cell to begin with sc so you remove the original dna 
no they did not sc you just superseded it ka yes and why i i mean this was probably 
of the biggest achievements of synthetic biology and biotechnology to date but it is not making life because you 
had a live cell that genome transplantation was replacing genome of one organism with a genome of another so 
was always life there it was never dead and then not dead but yeah so they took the artificial 
put it inside another cell and that cell started expressing proteins of from the artificial genome and started slowly 
morphing into that new organism and how the new organism was born and how the syn cells were born 
as of synthetic cells sc so certainly pretty good what they did ka oh amazing it was the technological 
that we get out of those products are incredible the most common way everyone uses these days to do 
cloning is a technique that was born during this project because they needed it and there was nothing available 
they made it and also the genome transplantation technique exist before they started working on it and then there 
several iterations of that syn cell they made it smaller and then yet smaller and then yet smaller and 
they made it slightly bigger because it started too slow for anyone to be able to put up with 
but there is many of those organisms right now where we know every single gene and we can control 
what every one of those genes do sc it might be worth just thinking about the actual process of 
i think people have in mind going in there with tweezers and a scalpel and cutting and repasting dna 
very tiny tweezers sc very tiny tweezers but not what we actually do ka no sc what do we 
ka what we do is we cut the dna to leave ends that have specific sequence and then we 
in new dna with ends that have a sequence that matches those cut points and then we ligate it 
glue it back together sc which really just means let the chemistry happen that brings it back together ka 
sc we are never picking up one strand and another strand and with our hands putting them together ka 
quite nobody has hands that small sc yeah molecules i mean nothing that we can make that is that 
and also when we say synthesizing a genome i myself am not completely clear on this is it like 
literally have the complete list gctta and we could type in any list we want and make a dna 
like that ka yes yes sc pretty good ka how making dna these days is there are those machines 
so there are four nucleobases and you can program a machine to couple to connect those nucleobases in a 
specific order sc and it take forever to do that i mean these are long right these are millions 
nucleobases ka so for the synthetic genome they actually had to develop several techniques to do it to stitch 
together most of the time what we do like on a daily basis is making genes that are few 
to a couple thousand nucleobases long and that take very long sc but that be enough to power whole 
ka absolutely not the smallest known genome is four hundred seventyfour genes and quite a bit of dna sc 
so how many bases in a gene i know wildly different numbers ka very wildly different from a few 
to a few thousand sc okay right so if the state of the art then at that time a 
years ago was sort of redesigning the dna and then plugging it back into an existing bacterium how far 
we come since then ka not very i mean come really far in understanding how this organism works but 
unable to take a genome plug it into a nonliving system and to get life out of it sc 
okay ka what my lab is trying to do with sc what trying to do ka with collaboration with 
craig venter institute people trying to basically do what they did except our chassis is not alive so when 
took that artificial dna put it in a living cell and that living cell changed into the new cell 
trying to do so far unsuccessfully but hopefully getting there is trying to take the nonliving piece of dna 
mix it with nonliving components that make proteins that make membranes and see if the system can right itself 
can start making all the proteins that will organize a proper way in which we expect life to organize 
and that would really well i know i already said we argue about the definitions but it sounds like 
would really be a synthetic life form ka that would be a life form that was created from nonliving 
sc yeah ka the reason hesitant to say synthetic to me personally it would be synthetic but there are 
people that would consider a synthetic life form only something that is completely different from an existing architecture so 
making is still dna rna twentyone amino acids perfect same trying to make a copy of a living cell 
from nonliving components sc sure ka if you want to talk about artificial in the proper sense of the 
it would be something designed to be different than what using as a template on the sc okay this 
why i care about the definitions both of those are interesting but they are different so count them as 
interesting one of is it true one of the obstacles here is that even in the tiniest genomes for 
little bacteria we know exactly what all those genes do right like venter was able to knock out some 
not kill it but others that if you knock them out the bacteria bacteriarize anymore but we know why 
absolutely called essential genes of unknown function and the biggest headache that we as a field have right now 
know those genes are absolutely necessary but got no idea what they do and kinda frustrating sc so even 
typing in our keyboard gttac whatever we know that certain sequences are necessary but not as if we can 
typing this because this is going to do the following thing in the right ka so frustrating about life 
general a black box sc yeah is that an ongoing research thing trying to figure that out ka yes 
is there some dream at some point of being able to type in a genome sequence and just simulate 
the computer what it will do ka it would be amazing and people are working towards it but impossible 
now because we know what all the proteins are actually doing sc and is it just these things are 
complicated is that the obstacle ka yes yeah sc okay so one of the things trying to do is 
only make a synthetic living breathing not breathing but living cell but also things that are celllike that might 
quite rise to the level of being alive ka yes sc and so what comes afterward ka quite good 
that actually we can make things that are not alive but are quite complex sc so for instance what 
do they do what stops them from being alive ka complexity mostly none of our systems selfreplicate right now 
we can replicate it but it selfreplicate a crucial distinction sc so it looks like a ka looks like 
sc has dna in it ka quacks like a cell but is not a cell sc okay but it 
have dna ka it does have dna it does have rna it does have ribosomes sc it makes proteins 
makes proteins sc it duplicate itself it replicate ka it duplicate itself sc you can go in there you 
clone it ka yes sc okay and what is the usefulness of these things ka we can study processes 
we cannot study in a complex live cell because the natural live cells are still black boxes no matter 
much we simplify it we just have no idea going on in there we can study single pathway and 
we caught everything that interacts with that pathway but we most likely in our system engineerable from the first 
from the every single building block can be manipulated so if we want to for example reconstitute a signaling 
or reconstitute a oncogenic pathway or make a gene circuit that produces a certain molecule we can design it 
scratch we can build it and we know exactly what we were hoping it will be because there is 
endogenous metabolism that will mess with our experiments sc and is this potentially useful just for downtoearth crass commerce 
of reasons for engineering and medicine and things like that beyond the fundamental questions of life and time ka 
much so a lot of what is paying the bills right now is when you think about biomanufacturing a 
of progress has been made in making pathways that can make anything you want and we need those pathways 
maybe a little bit of offtopic but we need to ramp up our bioengineering biomanufacturing capabilities because running out 
crude sources of chemicals like when people freak out about running out of oil they freak out for energy 
but we have different ways of getting energy we can have solar we can have wind we can have 
we do not have right now a good replacement for all the petrochemicals ka so all the crap we 
from oil that builds everything around us we have a replacement source for that so we need to learn 
to do it with the only good renewable chemical factories we can think of that will always be sustainable 
is biomanufacturing processes so we can have biological processes that make all the molecules we need the problem is 
cells kind of like doing it because a lot of those molecules are toxic to begin with so we 
build pathways that make the molecules we want but then we introduce them to cells to natural cells they 
at it and no part of it they say not going to do it because toxic to ka and 
biggest problem in biomanufacturing right now is how do you make all those complex toxic molecules now a nice 
about synthetic cells is that not alive so they care so you can build a synthetic cell that makes 
incredibly toxic or hard to make and it will not kill it because you kill something already dead another 
is kind of slowly entering this area of socalled personalized medicine where we want to make drugs in small 
tailored to the needs of every particular patient and if you think about chemical processes for making complex biomolecules 
can be drugs setting up a process for each molecule takes forever and really hard if you could have 
platform very versatile easily programmable to make small amounts of biomolecules that can be used as medicine or nutrients 
demand when you need it where you need it and not more and no less that would be really 
and another area where artificially engineered organisms could be really useful sc yeah no such thing as offtopic so 
about that we should talk about this i like that you brought up the petrochemical thing that always struck 
when people worried about fossil fuels and stuff like that running out of oil for gasoline basically and i 
thought like we do a lot of things with oil other than gasoline and these are this is a 
resource and we are literally setting it on fire right we are literally burning it ka absolutely sc so 
saying is that maybe your little semiliving synthetic cells can help us reconstitute the sort of chemistry that we 
get out of the ground for free ka i mean we have to find a way of doing it 
maybe a little too optimistic but i think by the time we run out of oil we will have 
renewable energy sources that we can drive our cars and run our ac or heat but we still have 
good path to replacing all of the chemicals and something i feel like get enough attention because everyone just 
out about energy and not about everything else we get from oil sc well and it opens up a 
set of vistas that heard people sort of mention in passing about for example combating climate change or something 
that by designing little microorganisms to go chew up the and the other things in the atmosphere that we 
the greenhouse gases is that at all feasible in your mind ka this is not the area that an 
in i would love to see that happen a little afraid of thinking about that because seen how well 
goes when we try to release an organism into an environment that sc what could go wrong chuckle ka 
so doing that on a planetary scale kind of gives me creeps but that mean not doable i also 
there are a lot of problems with climate change that could be solved without those giant planetaryscale interventions sc 
no means the replacement for doing more sensible things about fixing climate change but the medicine stuff i think 
also extremely promising i just get the impression that one hundred years from now body will be filled with 
little designed organisms that are keeping you healthy all the time ka i hope so i bet my money 
it i actually have a little startup betting money on it sc oh okay ka so hoping to get 
make it a reality sc skin in the game yes ka i also feel so a disclaimer very optimistic 
a selfserving optimism we are basically trying to program those little cells to go in and act as natural 
of analogs to the immune system without all the problems that the natural immune cells have as in selfreplication 
to turn on your own cells sc and fighting allergies and things like that maybe even combating cancer i 
what ka yeah looking more at cancer than allergies at this point i would love to fight allergies as 
especially living in minnesota in the summer it would be awesome but mostly looking at things that are very 
and very variable as in cancer no such disease as cancer sc no ka every single cancer is slightly 
and we make those cancer drugs that just go in and kill everything and this no this is probably 
the best or most efficient way of targeting at least some of those sc but what we have so 
perfect target for personalized medicine in that way and so being able to design things ka another kind of 
medicallyrelated problem is we hopefully are going to start sending people back in space for longer periods of time 
and fedex deliver to mars yet so if you need a specific medicine once half way through your fiveyear 
to mars not going to know what you will need a few years in advance like so going to 
those astronauts going to be as healthy as possible but everybody can get sick at any time with anything 
if in the middle of your mission to mars and you suddenly get sick you need a way to 
a drug that is targeted to your needs without knowing in advance what your needs will be ka and 
area where kind of a designable engineerable cells like synthetic cells might be really useful because they can be 
to order they can be made from scratch from a set list of building blocks so you can imagine 
blocks that are defined in advance but the way you combine them decides what the outcome is going to 
and so when halfway through your mission to mars you become deadly allergic to mars dust you make one 
of drug if you develop a cancer in the middle of that mission you develop another kind of drug 
your crew mate develops another kind of cancer you make yet another drug and so on sc so in 
vision are you not actually implanting the synthetic cells into the patient just using the synthetic cells to make 
medicine ka yes sc okay because clearly we understand a lot about the interplay between our own microbiomes and 
cells right so introducing new cells into people might be risky i know ka very much so one of 
reasons why all the commercial applications right now are focusing on things like cancer because the risktobenefit ratio there 
more risk acceptable when the disease is almost certain to kill you why we probably be treating allergies with 
therapies but we will be treating one some of the most deadly cancers with experimental therapies because we have 
that much to lose i mean a patient who has six months left to live if you extend that 
span by another six months you i want to say you won but you sc done something good ka 
something good sc but heard that allergic to cats so ka i am sc so a pretty big disaster 
at mindscape pretty very procat ka but prodog personally and not allergic to dogs so sc chuckle alright not 
the same thing but okay let you struggle through your life with that handicap but the other thing that 
me as i read about this stuff is the blurry line between medicine and biological things and just nanoscience 
all the things you might want to do at a very small scale robots computers engineering this is all 
of things you can do with your synthetic cells ka working on biocomputing right now too trying to make 
circuits that perform computation and store memory and again where synthetic cells are kinda handy because people have done 
lot of good biocomputing with light cells but as soon as you take your eyes off those cells they 
start going on their own and expressing genes they want not the genes you want them to express sc 
man ka i know synthetic cells are dumb enough that they think they can get away with anything chuckle 
once you program them to do something they will be doing that until they run out of energy and 
which point they will just sit and stare at the wall and not do anything else sc yeah part 
the fact that not alive ka exactly sc so they have some of the good benefits of living creatures 
our engineering purposes without the drawbacks ka yes sc and are there particular kinds of computations that it might 
useful to do this way ka right now still babystepping it doing boolean logic gates so the very simple 
gates that people know from playing with doing informatics so like and gate or or gate sc yeah start 
ka have to start somewhere sc builds an abacus next yeah next chuckle and is and just making this 
not something read but is there some future hope of making more largescale macroscopic materials constituted from synthetic cells 
always in my mind compare and contrast skeletons and bones which have the ability to be rigid but you 
break them and they will fix themselves to robotic metallic things which once they break it is there a 
of making materials that are stiff and sturdy but selfrepairing ka absolutely one of the probably most exciting promises 
this field is that you can imagine programming semiliving or sortofliving organisms so that they exhibit certain properties but 
keep some of those biggest hallmarks of biology like ability to selfrepair and grow sc i think we need 
word for this semiliving state chuckle where it replicate not on its own it needs some help ka wrong 
semiliving sc well yeah a little creepy but okay i ka sortofliving sc if you have a new word 
back to the greek roots or something like that you can definitely coin a term there yeah a brave 
world how do you see where be fifty or one hundred years from now and what doing with synthetic 
ka hopefully in one hundred years the because right now there is a pretty clear boundary between people like 
who do this molecular biological engineering and working on living systems and people that do the classical bioengineering with 
cells hopefully once we get better at it that boundary will disappear and we will be able to program 
organisms like we program machines right now to do the things we want and my goal is to erase 
distinction between synthetic cells and natural cells my goal is to build synthetic cells that are programmable understandable definable 
behave like natural cells and are as robust as natural cells sc yeah part of this buildacell collaboration when 
first heard buildacell i was hoping it was an app i could download from my iphone and i could 
a cell but not quite there yet ka there actually is a game where you can put together a 
organism not related to that chuckle ka the first hit when you google our collaboration sc so what is 
aiming at ka an international collaboration supposed to bring together people that work on building cells and since we 
no definition of synthetic cell we have no definition of life and everyone is motivated by slightly different goals 
would like to unify the community around this idea that biology is engineerable and biology fundamentally should be engineerable 
anyone trying to engineer living systems from nonliving components or engineer living systems so there so we have the 
to manipulate them as good as ability to manipulate electronic or nonliving machines all of those people are welcome 
the buildacell community basically people that can come together and talk about making life from scratch and nobody makes 
of us chuckle sc it reminded me a little bit of largescale particle physics experiments when you build a 
at the large hadron collider people in the collaboration and one of them builds a little calorimeter and the 
solders wires together so you have subgroups that are interested in lipid biolayers others are interested in ribosomes and 
forth and all working together ka yes too big of a project for any single lab or even a 
country to tackle it so why we started selforganizing into this international community sc are you going to reach 
particle physics scale where there are thousands of authors on every paper ka i would love that chuckle sc 
not there yet ka not there yet not quite there yet sc okay so i think the final go 
to outer space we had outer space in mind at the beginning looking for life elsewhere i think that 
some of the listeners necessarily know about the different environments where we can look for life part of your 
is to understand what to look for when looking for life and part of that is where we should 
so even right here in the solar system had this somewhat recent change of mind that moons of big 
are just as good a place to look for life as planets ka if not better sc why would 
be better ka smaller and they can hold onto water not as hot they actually have a surface we 
surface sc why does why historically was europa better at holding onto water better than mars ka that i 
know i know why mars lost water sc why did mars lose water ka because it never developed plate 
if you develop plate tectonics you can recirculate your water you can have water vapor in the atmosphere that 
spit out of the volcanoes and it comes back at as rain and gets spit out again mars never 
plate tectonics so my understanding not a planetary geologist but my understanding is the reason mars lost water and 
is because it was passive the planet was passive it never developed plate tectonics europa is frozen and it 
always frozen as far as we know so that might help because if all your water is encrusted in 
frozen layer of ice much easier to hold onto it sc frozen at the surface with the ice but 
beneath that huge amounts of liquid water on europa ka yes and why promising because water that kind of 
there encapsulated in that crust of ice and doing its water stuff clearly warm enough to be liquid so 
stuff and why we have hopes for it sc chemistry going on in a aqueous solution yeah ka if 
have aqueous solution you will have organic chemistry going on in there sc and so one of your things 
studying synthetic life because we want to be better at knowing alien life when we see it what should 
be looking for when we do go visit and contaminate europa chuckle ka i can tell you very easily 
should we not be looking for still not sure what should we be looking for i would definitely look 
organic molecules that are very complex and homochiral so chirality is this orientation of in which direction molecules point 
and on earth extremely particular about our chirality all peptides have certain chirality all nucleic acids have certain chirality 
no exceptions there sc this is lefthandedness versus righthandedness in the molecules yeah ka exactly yep and that is 
natural natural as in abiotic you cannot get such conserved homochirality at least we know nonliving catalysts that would 
you that much specific systemwide homochirality so one thing i would look for personally is if you find a 
and a set of molecules that are very complex and all have conserved the same chirality then that might 
one of the good clues that the process that gave rise to them is somewhat biological sc but the 
way to do that is to go and scoop up the molecules you do it spectroscopically by looking at 
reflected the light reflects the same from lefthanded and righthanded molecules ka you need to go scoop it up 
it sc and hoping to do that ka hoping i think within our lifetimes get to do that it 
be easier on enceladus because enceladus is nice enough to spit it out into the space for us they 
those giant plumes that spit out water vapors and that water vapor is probably lousy with organics so we 
just do a flyover saying just going sc yeah just fly to saturn ka fly over to pick up 
sample sounds easier to me than land the drill pick up a sample sc sure have we ever done 
have we ever done flybys to kind of scoop up chemicals and test them ka not that i know 
sc okay the slowing down is always hard much easier to zoom by a planet than to slow down 
yep slow down get into orbit go low enough sc bringing fuel with you is hard right ka yeah 
even have to be sample return you actually have to bring enough fuel to get off the planet or 
but even get there and get close enough is hard enough sc is there some feeling heard it mentioned 
idea that if you just find chemistry where a lot of really heavy molecules a lot of really long 
molecules the only way we know how to make them is via life or biotic processes ka i would 
subscribe to that because there are many ways to polymerize to make longer molecules from shorter molecules and there 
many ways of doing that in a biotic way with no life sc okay so this is a controversial 
different people have different feelings about this ka different people have different opinions sc yeah okay why hard laughter 
and what about far away if we look at exoplanets discovered bushels full of exoplanets now we go do 
chemical analysis of them on any short time scale are the ways just looking at the light getting from 
other planets to say it looks like there might be life ka so not as good at looking at 
as people seem to think the way we discover most of our exoplanets is looking at the star and 
doing something funky so we start doing the math and the only way that makes sense is that okay 
planet in the orbit we actually see many we seen many exoplanets yet sc right we see the star 
or get eclipsed or something like that ka and then how we we have seen some exoplanets as in 
some of either light reflected from that exoplanet which is incredibly hard or seen the star eclipsed by the 
that passes right in front of it but not like we can actually look directly at the planet and 
a spectra of it so it will be very hard to do remote life sensing like that sc okay 
say that astronomers get good at it is there something to look for ka i think the easiest way 
do it is to look for physical chemical conditions on those planets right now when we discover planets we 
estimated orbits that are so large in the radius that it can go anywhere from no liquid water at 
because too hot to completely dead frozen on the other end and still not sure even where the planet 
within that orbit if we get better at defining what physical chemical conditions we need for life so building 
kind of artificial life under different conditions in the lab to decide okay this is absolutely needed for life 
this is not absolutely necessary for life then we have those boundary conditions and then we can look at 
exoplanets and see this planet probably is likely to have the conditions that we know can support ka and 
judging by the history of earth life happens quickly as soon as earth was habitable life came to earth 
again sample sites that equals one but from that sample we can tell that life is almost inevitable under 
physical and chemical conditions of a planet sc well i was going to ask you about this because i 
that there is some disagreement or at least not everyone thinks that they know the answer ka nobody knows 
answer sc no one actually knows the answer right but people have convictions nevertheless ka yeah sc is making 
easy or hard so like you say we have one data point and in some sense the data point 
it was easy here on earth it happened relatively quickly it might have taken almost a billion years but 
you say as soon as it became habitable the very very early earth was just inhabitable and so there 
no life then but as soon as it cool down enough boom there was life and so maybe that 
that once you get complex chemistry and it cools down you get life but on the other hand we 
the other planets that obviously have life on them so those more data points in some sense ka so 
now we have any other planet currently habitable to terrestrial life to earthtype life not even the very particular 
but any life that would look like a terrestrial life so that goes back to some of the problems 
discussed before possible that some of the planets in the solar system were habitable in the past like mars 
that venus could be habitable right now to a somewhat different life form sc very different i would think 
differentish like those there are people that have very good arguments for the fact that those clouds we see 
venus could actually be made of living organisms except not going to know that unless we actually go there 
test it so we cannot say right now if we have any other life in the solar system or 
we cannot say either way because we been there and tested that sc fair enough ka there is no 
planet that would resemble earth in physical chemically in the solar system that would have liquid water within the 
range of temperatures and with the magnetosphere to block the radiation so if there was a planet like that 
it was sterile then that would be a very good argument for the fact that earth was in some 
unique and we got lucky sc but we just know right ka we have no idea sc and so 
the end of the podcast now we can let our hair down and speculate a little bit once we 
this far we have to ask about intelligent life out there in the universe life happened very quickly on 
but took a long time for it to become multicellular do you so what do you think are if 
the road blocks to life becoming big and complex ka very unlikely for that to happen because the cost 
becoming complex is very high and life on earth only became complex when it had no other way when 
were those giant evolutionary bottlenecks and life just had to find a way to survive and intelligence necessarily that 
of a thing like we could sterilize earth right now if we get into some big atomic conflicts sc 
has its drawbacks ka it has the intelligence has its drawbacks so i think possible to imagine there would 
complex multicellular life somewhere in the universe but the probability of it developing sapiency of any sort is rather 
sc okay so getting nuclei a cellular nucleus to go to eukaryotes and then becoming multicellular ka just what 
know from the terrestrial earth life sc right ka we think multicellular organisms have to be eukaryotic as in 
a nucleus but that we know that sc but do you think that getting a cellular nucleus was a 
step or an easy one ka i think that was actually an easy one sc an easy one okay 
kind of pointless until you build up on it and you do more but i could easily imagine a 
organism made of cells that look like prokaryotes that have nucleus sc all of these always a competition because 
you become more complex you need more resources you need more specific conditions but some benefit for it and 
always very unclear other than the fact that it happened in our evolutionary history which one of these was 
going to happen and which one of these really got lucky ka absolutely sc and so your guess is 
that leap to multicellularity might be hard in the leap to smartness intelligence once multicellular part of me thinks 
some of those cells are going to differentiate into neurons and then just a matter of time i know 
it might be just a matter of time if you think about developing a smartness of a dog or 
dolphin sc so you think that once a smart as a dolphin be building spaceships eventually ka dolphins built 
yet sc they have opposable thumbs yeah ka exactly so there are just so many things that have to 
together for a civilization you have to be able to make fire or test some kind of a way 
processing raw materials you have to have opposable thumbs more likely like i think dogs would rule the world 
they had opposable thumbs fortunately for us they sc yes ka and that life span of a civilization at 
given all we know right now is probably not that long in the grand scheme of things so even 
there was ever another intelligent civilization the likelihood of them running into us is rather low sc my personal 
is that thousands of years from now when visiting all these different solar systems in the galaxy that probably 
cellular life all over the place but more skeptical about biospheres ruled by dolphins and dogs that are smart 
sociable but have technological capabilities ka yeah probably not sc but see i know ka no sc this is 
field where so little data that a good reminder of how much just beginning to ask some of these 
in a principled scientific way ka yeah and we will have no way of knowing it until we actually 
out there and look sc well hopefully your synthetic cells will help us live forever so that will increase 
chances that be here to find out the answer ka you would think so that would be kinda boring 
think sc by forever i mean just a few thousand years we need to go crazy ka okay okay 
that sc all right so let you get back to work on that kate adamala thank you so much
