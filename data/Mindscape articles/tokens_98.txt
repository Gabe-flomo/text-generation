show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today 
be talking about heredity this is of course a very old idea the idea that something inside us some 
some features that get passed down through the generations so we inherited something from our ancestors and we send 
down to our descendants back in the day there used to be the thought that royal blood was handed 
that the right to be the king or the queen or the emperor depended on who your parents were 
suppose still countries in which that is the case but we know a lot more about how heredity really 
now than we used to we know that all of our cells have a little molecule in them called 
and that dna is a little code a chain of letters a g c t that the arrangement of 
letters tells us what makes up who we are or at least a simplistic version of it where you 
of dna as kind of like a blueprint that if you knew what the dna was you could predict 
what the organism was going to be maybe even what kind of food they would like or what kind 
occupation they would have later in life sc today we know a little bit more complicated than that more 
on than just our dna to make up who we are not only nature versus nurture but even the 
part is very complicated epigenetics and development factors mitochondrial dna the expression of different parts of the genes that 
have and so in a very very rapid state of evolution as it were in terms of how we 
about how heredity works these days you can get your genome sequenced you can send it into a company 
some money and tell you something about your genetic heritage on the horizon we see the ability to edit 
we can do it in some ways now and the ability to do that for human beings probably is 
very far away so natural to imagine can we design what the next generation of human beings is going 
be like can we design the animals and plants that make up the rest of our ecosystem sc these 
important questions as well as fascinating ones so we have today carl zimmer as our guest carl is one 
the very best science writers working out there been working and writing about this area of genetics and heredity 
dna for a very long time you may know carl through his blogging or his twitter account his new 
times column or you may have heard him on npr now carl has a major new book out called 
has her laugh the powers perversions and potential of heredity a door stopper a big one but full of 
individual human stories as well as the deep science behind what we know about heredity so gonna talk about 
heredity works what we do and know about it and most importantly where the new knowledge that gaining every 
might take us it seems very plausible that what learning these days might dramatically change how we think about 
human beings so go music sc carl zimmer welcome to the mindscape podcast carl zimmer hey great to talk 
you sc so now known each other virtually at least online since the early halcyon salad days of the 
world right that how i got to know you reading your blog and you read mine cz absolutely yeah 
when blogs were the future sc blog yes now in the future and no one writes blogs anymore laughter 
they delivered us here sc exactly the future is a journey been through the future now in the postfuture 
i written this gigantic magisterial book about heredity inheritance she has her laugh and the subtitle of course the 
perversions and potential of heredity and while reading it i help but think as a physicist goodness how lucky 
am that what i do for a living really matter to this is a kind of science that everyone 
feelings about does that come through in your work cz oh i think that everybody clings to heredity in 
profound way and i see that when i give talks about my book i have learned to keep my 
remarks fairly short because people just have tons of questions and the questions come from the fact that we 
heredity to define who we are and also what is our connection both to the past and to the 
you ask for anything more intimate than that sc yeah so the future in terms of our children our 
you mean cz sure absolutely and also what if we tamper with the heredity of other species then what 
left after gone well heredity will carry on those sorts of changes into the future sc so i think 
who is involved in this conversation right now knows a little bit not entering and not telling people something 
never heard before that something called dna in our cells that carries some information so try to remember what 
was like before we knew that people still had an idea of inheritance and heredity and things being passed 
through the blood even before darwin and mendel came along cz right hard to reconstruct the way people fought 
the past especially when they use the concepts and the words that we use today and yeah we can 
to get some clues about it just by looking back and trying to piece together for example there were 
about blood as you say we still use the word to talk about what we really mean by genes 
blood for example blue blood is something that is like well you come from a blue blood family in 
words somehow like that is inherited down through the generations your status the irony is of course that the 
actually comes from a particular time and a particular place it was in spain in the when people in 
were trying to distinguish themselves from jews and muslims so this is and this is where the whole issue 
race comes from literally the word race starts to be used in spain in this way and sc when 
we talking what century you said cz and then to and so the idea with blue blood was that 
you were racially pure then someone could see your veins through your translucent skin and so you can get 
ideas about how in western society there were these ways in which we started to define ourselves as being 
up of something that was being passed down through the generations but really it until the that people like 
darwin actually framed it as a scientific question like okay something something molecular that is being passed down through 
generations and explains why people have these traits that seem to run in families so what is it sc 
darwin have said the word molecular but we know what you mean there is something that is being given 
parents to children but without genes without dna or anything like that with this basic idea that we inherit 
our mothers and our fathers did anyone ever wonder about the fact that why we always just exactly halfway 
between our mothers and our fathers in every trait there clearly seem to be variations around that did people 
premendel and dna worry about this fact cz yeah they could see for themselves that these patterns of heredity 
not simple they really puzzled over them mendel was just in a long line of people who were scratching 
heads and these were plant breeders these were animal breeders in the someone named bakewell in england became legendary 
he created a new breed of sheep and he did it by carefully breeding different kinds of sheep together 
coming up with these rules of his own for how to breed them and it was an incredible accomplishment 
people would breed animals and their offspring would be all sort of a mess they would be all this 
when if breeding animals you want them all to be the same if you want a particular kind of 
from an animal you want them all to have that same taste you want a kind of wool you 
the same wool so it was a huge puzzle and struggle and the stakes were enormous by the and 
were actually looking at breeding in other words heredity as part of their national wealth if you could breed 
crops and new livestock you were going to make your country rich sc i love the practicality of it 
reminds me of how thermodynamics which can be a very abstract and theoretical subject arose from trying to get 
steam engines this is definitely an era where a give and take between people with boots on the ground 
to make better products and trying to understand the world better as scientists cz yeah it is interesting because 
assume that everybody must have thought about heredity the way we do and wondered about it the way we 
five hundred years ago or one thousand years ago but they just and it really until some practical questions 
people to really think carefully about this and the other people in addition to breeders were psychiatrists in the 
particularly in france and also in some extent the united states and elsewhere psychiatrists were trying to understand madness 
they were struck by the fact that when they would do questionnaires for their patients their patients often had 
in their family or more distant relatives who also were institutionalized or maybe they had something that seemed like 
form of madness and so they said is this a hereditary disease and if so how on earth could 
be passed down through the and so darwin actually read a lot of psychiatry when he was developing his 
ideas about heredity sc so this connection between heredity and intelligence and madness and thought was there from the 
very beginning cz yeah a lot of the things that talking about right now people were talking about one 
fifty or two hundred years ago with just as much loudness and passion and conflict sc maybe not just 
much now we have twitter and they have that there so an amplifier that they have cz yeah but 
had pamphlets sc pamphlets cz yeah a lot of the stuff would get circulated in things like pamphlets get 
new pamphlet every day i feel like twitter is just an extension of the old traditions of pamphlets sc 
maybe blogging is the past more than the future cz there you go i know where podcasting fits in 
sc so then we did get to genetics to real genetics to mendel mendel by the way i have 
always say this i went to an augustinian university villanova and augustinians have a slight inferiority complex compared to 
jesuits who are wonderfully intellectually have this wonderful intellectual tradition but we have two really important augustinians in history 
was gregor mendel and the other was martin luther so they always the best catholics but they did affect 
world in an important way so mendel among other things he helped pinpoint this discreteness of heredity that there 
be like you get this feature or you so there must be somehow it just a blending of your 
parents there was some piece of information a quantum a physicist would call it being handed down through the 
cz right mendel call them genes sometimes the terms he used get translated as factors so there would be 
factor that was in a plant and there was an almost mathematical beauty to how these factors combined in 
offspring and then produced a trait so just an example that people may recall from high school is that 
can be wrinkled or they can be smooth and if you cross two wrinkled pea plants together gonna get 
but wrinkled peas if you cross two smooth peas together you might get nothing but smooth peas and then 
next generation after that smooth peas and smooth peas forever on the other hand if you cross a smooth 
and a smooth pea together you might be surprised to suddenly have a quarter of the peas being wrinkled 
the fact is that that wrinkled factor can hide because what we would now well actually mendel called it 
recessive so yeah so that was the first recognition that there was there was this thinking about heredity when 
two distinct parts the invisible factors that get carried on through the generations and then what you see what 
called the phenotype sc and then we started finally figuring it out moving quickly through the history here i 
get to the modern world but it century that we were able to identify these genes as being carried 
this wonderful molecule the dna and watson and crick etcetera and by that time correct me if wrong but 
was already this new synthesis of genetics and evolutionary biology natural selection darwin and so the dna was just 
out not just but it was figuring out what the mechanism of that was cz yeah a beautiful distillation 
eighty years of really rough science yes exactly yeah people had known about dna really since the but they 
like what is this weird sc sorry just to make that very clear they knew that there was a 
called dna cz exactly if you pulled apart cells you would find different components so you would find some 
that are known as proteins that all had a similar chemical composition and then you would find this stuff 
they called nucleic acid and people just really know what it was for and actually even in the mid 
lot of people thought proteins were what genes were made of and it took some elegant experiments to demonstrate 
actually if you transfer dna from one microbe to another you transfer that trait the proteins matter and so 
once we figured out the structure of dna then all of a sudden we can get down to the 
details of how genes make heredity possible in other words that almost like genes are like texts made up 
these units where like letters made up from a fourletter alphabet and we have over three billion letters in 
dna and change the letters or cut and paste chunks of text and you get changes to us and 
changes can be passed down if the dna is being faithfully copied sc right and so three billion base 
in the human dna but we talk about only having like genes so gonna ask every biologist i ever 
to on the podcast to explain this it took me a long long while to get it right but 
the relationship between the base pairs in the dna and what we call genes cz yeah kinda messy but 
is messy sc yeah cz so the way that people traditionally think about genes is a stretch of dna 
encodes a protein and so every protein is encoded by a gene it is true although sometimes you get 
that are made by combining genes together and all sorts of stuff we need to get into but in 
case we have as you say of these proteincoding genes and they only make up about or so one 
of the human genome so then the big question is all the other sc yes cz yeah so some 
it maybe of it has functions of its own so actually some of them are also genes just that 
go the full process towards making proteins you have thousands of genes we know how many that actually encode 
molecules sc okay cz so you may be used to thinking of rna as part of the process to 
protein you got a gene made of sc right so yeah go ahead cz you got a gene made 
dna you make a copy in rna which is a singlestranded version of dna basically and then you use 
rna as a template for building proteins out of a different set of molecules called amino acids and true 
it turns out that sometimes our cells will make an rna molecule and then it and not only it 
that rna molecule has a really important job to do for example in women women have two x chromosomes 
need to keep one of them shut off or gonna basically poison themselves with too many proteins from the 
chromosome cz men only have one x chromosome so there are these rna molecules that basically wrap around the 
chromosome one of the x chromosomes in women and silence it and so we know that at least some 
these rna molecules play an important job those are more genes but that still leaves you with a lot 
the rest of the genomes so some of that dna is really important as genetic switches for turning on 
off genes elsewhere in the genome and then the rest a lot of it is probably what scientists would 
call junk a lot of them are dead genes genes that have mutated and just are useless now and 
just carry them along some of them are actually descend from viruses so viruses infect our dna and make 
in the cells that get passed down and just spread all over our genome and bulk it up with 
sorts of stuff that we actually use so sc they also could be codes that were injected by aliens 
of years ago to be activated some point in the future right cz yeah right now i seen the 
on that yet but maybe seen a preprint i sc giving you jewels here carl you should write the 
cz yeah all right gonna have the scoop of the century sc but a good reminder that not intelligently 
the cell is kind of a mess that has been put together over billions of years and dna care 
its job is to encode genes into proteins it does whatever it wants to do or whatever it needs 
do to make things function some of the dna is making proteins some of making rna that will do 
some of just going along for the ride it keeps getting copied all the time right cz yeah hard 
believe but the cell is a lot sloppier than we think of it as being a lot of dna 
is used by our cells to produce rna molecules and then the cell just immediately shreds all that rna 
those were just accidental they were just they really have any function so you can have junk dna shooting 
rna molecules but they serve any purpose the cell just manages this chaos by having certain proteins that go 
and say like you supposed to be and if not then they just shred and just recycle it to 
more rna molecules so yeah if you really get to know cells intelligent design becomes laughable sc okay we 
this idea that the coding parts there are parts of the dna stretches of dna many many base pairs 
once that will code into a protein probably an informal and incorrect idea sure none of our extremely sophisticated 
welleducated mindscape listeners would have this idea but some people might think that a direct map from a gene 
a trait to how big our nose are what color our hair is or how charismatic we are but 
complicated than that right cz for the most part yeah it is more complicated good to learn about mendel 
high school but i do think that gonna be important for schools to take students beyond mendel now that 
are getting their dna tested by companies like you really understand those test results if just relying on pea 
experiments sc right cz your blood type sure like one gene and different versions of the gene that can 
your blood type okay no problem but for most of the traits that we actually really care about or 
about and even seemingly simple ones like height they are influenced by many many many many many different genes 
so yeah you say that i do i have the tall just meaningless sc so we brought ourselves up 
about as you infer imply the level of high school biology what people remember we have a dna we 
it along and i think that even if some complicated nonlinear map from the genes in our dna to 
traits people still have this idea that basically a molecule the dna and from the molecule us that just 
us but we know a lot more than that now also various ways in which the thing that we 
into is more than just encoded in our dna in any straightforward way is that an accurate statement cz 
yeah definitely funny if you say to someone you have two eyes you must have gotten your two eyes 
your gonna look at you funny like that make and the fact is that you did get your two 
from your parents but when we talk about you got this you got that from your really more interested 
the things that are different between people so that we can say like you are tall and your great 
birdie was tall so you must have gotten it from even though of course birdie is off to the 
whatever my point being that we just get confused about what it is that talking about when we talk 
these traits cz and the fact is that you might be tall like your uncle birdie is tall sure 
because of the genes you inherit but maybe you and your uncle birdie also had the privilege of growing 
in a affluent society an affluent family you had good diets you got medicine when you were a kid 
so that you had the opportunity to grow to be tall because the fact is that all over the 
the average height of people is several inches higher than it was a century ago and not because we 
now inheriting a different set of genes just that in that respect the world got to be a better 
and so you have to take into account the combined influences of genes and environment or actually as shakespeare 
called it nature and nurture sc get there but i think that even at the level of nature even 
the level of our inheritance our genetic inheritance learning about from your book among other places how complicated that 
for example the idea of mitochondrial dna cz right sc we have these little genetic stowaways in every single 
of our cells and we hand them down to subsequent generations cz right right yeah even if you just 
yourself to genes heredity can be a lot more complicated and strange than we learned about mitochondria we have 
or hundreds of them in every cell and we depend on them for our survival the little factories that 
fuel for our cell using oxygen and various nutrients to build fuel that we then burn they do lots 
other stuff too so sc the powerhouse of the cell cz yeah absolutely and the weird thing about them 
several weird things one is that got their own dna in them aside from the dna tucked away in 
nucleus so all got their own dna and if you look at a cell you can actually watch mitochondria 
on their own and they make new copies of their own dna for those new daughter cells and you 
say that make sense that sounds like and i was like guess what bacteria about billion years ago when 
were singlecelled the ancestors of mitochondria somehow ended up inside of our cells in maybe some symbiotic relationship like 
fish that go inside the mouths of bigger fish and then they became basically permanent residents so that they 
outside of our cells anymore cz and as if that weird enough when a sperm approaches an egg swimming 
and using that mitochondria to generate that fuel to swim so the only way it can get to an 
is to use its mitochondria and then it reaches the egg and it jumps in its chromosomes but then 
also destroys its own mitochondria it just rips them apart sc so both the sperm and the egg have 
mitochondria from dad and mom cz right and the sperm do not deliver their mitochondria into the egg sc 
bastards cz well puzzling because when you look at our chromosomes we are a split between our parents but 
look at our mitochondria all mom just all mom sc so mitochondrial inheritance is not sexual reproduction cz exactly 
for some reason we keep out one of the parents from that process and interesting what that means is 
your mitochondria is extremely similar to your and your and so on and so on and so on because 
your chromosomes in every generation the pairs of chromosomes they shuffle some of their dna together sc right cz 
so they swap pieces in this process called meiosis and so after several generations your chromosome number two really 
all that much like your great great great great chromosome two but mitochondria basically the same and so really 
for tracing genealogy for example you can say like well this person has to be the child of this 
no two ways about it and yeah scientists who are just looking at the basic questions about heredity are 
is this why would the sperm not give the mitochondria why is it only the and there are some 
theories about it one theory is that if you have two batches of mitochondria inside a person coming from 
people going to not play well together that gonna operate differently and that could actually cause problems and sc 
makes sense when meiosis happens meiosis is the splitting of the cell into a little sexual reproduction cell we 
our genome in half and then gonna recombine with the half from the other parent and the mitochondria participating 
that process mitochondria and are just there separately and they might come into conflict like you said cz right 
interesting we think of mom and genes as playing nicely in our own genome but there are conflicts between 
genes in our parents evolutionary conflicts sc sometimes conflicts between our actual parents too cz yeah and now think 
it inside our dna sometimes be like genes are maybe driving kids to grow faster because good for the 
evolutionary benefit the mother meanwhile if mother has to carry the children has to be pregnant too much growth 
can really drain her resources and may mean that she has fewer children over her lifetime and so you 
actually find that the copy of a gene is turned on a copy is turned off inside the child 
like this tug of war going on sc sure cz just to try that finds this optimal thing and 
sometimes you actually find there are genes or pieces of dna that basically just totally break law completely and 
override that split between which chromosome ends up in an egg or a sperm this was illustrated with a 
once of certain kinds of flies certain strains of flies where they would almost always produce daughters and scientists 
like going on and it turned out that there was a gene that was basically hijack it was sitting 
the female chromosome in flies and was basically ensuring that these flies did not have any sons because if 
were just daughters that spread this gene further the ultimate selfish gene sc well this makes sense maybe it 
sense maybe leaping ahead too far but we have this game theoretic way of thinking about not just the 
to survive as organisms but we can in the selfish gene way of thinking think of it as the 
genomes trying to pass themselves down and mom has a genetic set of information and so does dad and 
both wanna win and in human beings in mammals this rough equilibrium that reached where children are male and 
but certainly not universal across the animal kingdom a different equilibria you might imagine reaching where the struggle plays 
in different ways cz sure and actually there are some animals that adjust the ratio of their offspring just 
on what their environment looks like there are birds that in effect what doing is looking around and saying 
i need a lot of daughters to stick around and to help me raise my other and voila incredibly 
produce more daughters than sons and then there are other situations where they produce more sons than daughters and 
the sons fly off cz we like to think we like to take biology and put it into categories 
try to come up with absolutes observations become law or males and females become these absolute categories that you 
never have any exception to we keep doing that i think we just have brains that really like categories 
heredity just does not work like that and yeah there are some patterns that repeat themselves a lot but 
lot of times those patterns are this sort of a stable balance produced by competition that works out into 
almost like a detente sc well i talked with alice dreger in episode three of the podcast and we 
about intersexuality and how the fact that the idea two sexes a convenient fiction very useful a good approximation 
if gonna try to be a little bit more careful a whole bunch of stuff in between in different 
you can be in between and this i think that philosophically this is just a really important point that 
up that we organize the world we human beings for our comprehension because easy for us but as we 
to be more and more accurate all those complications are gonna become more and more relevant to a better 
cz yeah and i notice that a lot of times people will justify these absolute categories by saying look 
this is just nature this is biology you have to just accept and i was like you wanna talk 
biology take a little tour shall sc through my book on inheritance laughter cz absolutely absolutely the fact is 
heredity itself works very differently in a lot of different organisms and the irony is this is one reason 
mendel was forgotten actually so this one of these incredible ironies is that mendel studied peas and he was 
my gosh look at this mathematical thing and he wrote to one of his mentors and his mentor is 
interesting not sure what to make of this but why you see if you can replicate this if this 
what you say it is then you ought to be able to find it in another plant so mendel 
guess agreed with that and he went and studied another common garden plant and it turned out that this 
one hawkweed i think i forget the name now it reproduce in the neat sexual way that peas do 
it has pollen pollen is sort of like the plant equivalent of sperm they have male and female gametes 
you have to have fertilization but in these other plants once fertilization happens the ovules the eggs as it 
just basically just kick out any male dna they use it they do meiosis within their own genes and 
like clones except that shuffling their dna with every generation boom those lovely three to one patterns that mendel 
with peas just not there at all when he looks at another species and then like and you imagine 
he had picked another species that was very neat worked like peas did that he might have gained more 
but no he was forgotten for basically fifty years sc good to know that the deflationary role of mentors 
not changed in academia over the centuries i think done that to my students sometimes i love the idea 
mitochondria as important as they are these stowaways basically living their own lives handing down their own genetic inheritance 
part of what makes us who we are and so forth are there other examples of that i know 
we carry around a whole microbiome a whole set of little monocellular organisms that function in us but my 
is that we build those up throughout our lives we actually get those from mom and dad cz well 
is a big question right now and people who are trying to really nail it down at the moment 
it is true that you pick up microbes every day picking them up off your keyboard and your doorknob 
shaking hands or having yogurt just swimming through a microbial ocean sc and by you mean me in particular 
mean all of the listeners out not my keyboard that is worse than average right cz well heard things 
the thing is that we also know that there are lots of species that passed down certain microbes as 
as they do their own genes my favorite example is cockroaches sc okay sc cockroaches actually depend on one 
of bacteria to help them to eat food because the bacteria can actually make some of the compounds they 
for proteins out of their food the cockroaches have the genes to do it so they totally depend on 
bacteria in fact they actually build special little organs for these bacteria to live in and the bacteria actually 
inside the own cells in this organ and when it comes time for the female to produce her eggs 
incredible happens some of these cells that carry these microbes they just start crawling and they make their way 
the body to the eggs and then they open up and they basically deliver these bacteria into the eggs 
so after these eggs get fertilized by a male cockroach then the cockroach is born with these bacteria ready 
go just like we are with our mitochondria sc biology is very scary laughter cz mind blowing the best 
on all of this is ed book contain for me what interests me in particular about this is to 
about this as another form of heredity another channel of heredity like you got your own but then you 
these bacteria sc yeah cz now we have anything quite like that except for mitochondria that we know of 
that we know of cz right but maybe there is something like heredity in the way that some of 
bacteria end up inside of us scientists are trying to figure out for example are human embryos sterile when 
the uterus the evidence is not clear what is clear is that as a baby moves through the birth 
during delivery it gets slathered in bacteria and some of that bacteria goes into its gut and there are 
forms of bacteria that the mother encourages to grow in the birth canal and not only that but the 
contains bacteria as well as well as bacteria food in other words sugars in the milk that babies digest 
but bacteria can there is a debate right now whether there might be certain species that are being put 
babies early on and define our own species that way sc a very romantic picture you are painting the 
of childbirth is laughter so enhanced by your scientific understanding really great cz it was but it raises some 
practical medical questions caesarean sections are exploding in countries like the united states and so those babies are not 
that exposure and so a question well does that matter can you still pick up those species just by 
handled by your parents and other people or does not getting that seeding at the beginning is that a 
because if your microbiome quite right when young that can lead to problems throughout your life your immune system 
not work properly for example sc is it still thought to be true that the number of unicellular organisms 
our microbiome is more cells than human cells in our body cz actually no sc i heard rumors that 
had gone away that thought cz yeah yeah i and other people when write about the microbiome we always 
your microbes outnumber your own cells by which is always fun to say sc it is cz it turns 
probably not to be true probably more like sc okay cz we have about thirtyseven trillion cells of our 
cells it might be around the same i know forty million bacteria i that count the viruses and the 
and all the other fun critters that are living inside of us the final number of the full microbiome 
be higher but not a thing anymore sc but a body a biological body is a complicated open system 
ecosystem all by itself a little bus that is carrying around a whole world of little critters talking to 
other and evolving and doing their own things cz yes but not a totally random collection of critters the 
species and the same strains tend to turn up again and again in people your microbiome is gonna be 
than mine but not too differently and so if you look at human microbiomes compared to a gonna be 
lot more similar to each other than chimpanzees are and it seems like we have filters sc right cz 
not everybody gets a seat in the bus sc and then also the idea that learning more and more 
just the information in our dna even just getting back to the genetic part of inheritance more to it 
to how we pass information down the whole story of epigenetics and so forth i hear that advocating that 
take epigenetic yoga classes so they can pass down new things that they learned to their children is that 
cz many people are saying that no laughter sc i hear people saying it yeah cz yeah right right 
i think you should take epigenetic yoga if you like it but think that your kids are gonna be 
for it laughter sc but the idea is that we can learn something and pass it down right cz 
that we could have an experience that alters how our genes work and that alteration can get passed down 
future generations the crux of epigenetics and heredity and tricky and i explored in my book and definitely good 
for it happening in plants good evidence for it happening in little tiny tiny worms when you get to 
a very tantalizing experiments for example there is one experiment where scientists would expose male mice to a certain 
and then give them a shock and then they learn just to associate the odor with the shock and 
they took sperm from the mice and used it in in vitro fertilization and then produced mouse pups and 
seems like the mice in the next generation responded oddly to that same odor and so the claim was 
somehow that learned memory that learned association about that smell got passed about down to the mouse pups when 
paper came out the journal put lamarck on the cover laughter sc remind us who lamarck is mr lamarck 
mr lamarck right lamarck was a french biologist who preceded darwin he was most active in the early and 
up with his own theory of evolution which depended a lot on known as the inheritance of acquired traits 
so he had a classic example that giraffes stretch their neck to reach leaves some nervous fluid that causes 
necks to get a little bit longer you can think about that like building up muscles and then those 
would pass down that longer neck to their descendants and so then over many generations the giraffes would adapt 
their environment by getting a longer neck and so the claim i guess is that well mice are adapting 
their environment by learning about the risks that they face and that their offspring are inheriting that knowledge sc 
cz so the basic idea sc and how would this work at a molecular level for the mice is 
pups you call them mice pups mice babies or puppies cz pups pups sc okay good i learned something 
a matter of obviously the dna are not being altered as you smell something your dna is still your 
but somehow information being passed down to the next generation that is not in the dna somehow in the 
make up of what goes into making a little puppy laughter cz yeah yeah i if you call them 
puppies at a biology conference people will probably look at you funny sc you think that people will see 
me and not realize not a biologist cz an impostor in our ranks a cosmologist get him out we 
that genes are attended to by lots of molecules in the cell genes just take care of themselves and 
there are proteins for example that will clamp on to genes and they can essentially shut them down there 
other places that proteins latch on to dna and they can switch on a gene you can coil dna 
spools and then basically anything that gets coiled up any gene just be used to make a protein just 
tucked away and those changes can be very long lasting like when a cell divides those same controls will 
effect be inherited by the two new cells so why your skin cells when they divide they make skin 
they make brain cells or tooth cells or something we know that epigenetics really matters a lot no question 
that and so the question is could these kinds of processes change the way that genes are being used 
then could those changes those proteins and those coils or whatever get passed down through the generations we know 
yeah we know cz the mechanism for it especially for mammals hard to figure out how the mechanism would 
work and you look at a mouse experiment all the critics of this kind of research who says like 
telling me that this change that is happening in the brain the daddy brain and that then that is 
communicated into daddy sperm and then somehow that is then making its way through fertilization through the development of 
embryo through the development of a brain and then somehow getting plugged back into the brain in the same 
that daddy had been and a lot of scientists just say that make any sense at sc right but 
is something being studied try to figure it out cz yeah but in the meantime epigenetic yoga laughter there 
literally psychiatrists who will help you to undo the epigenetic trauma probably that your grandparents passed down to you 
has totally saturated pop culture and i honestly know how it happened because epigenetics is messy and complicated and 
language is totally inscrutable and yet when i give talks half the questions i get after the talks are 
sc look writing a book about quantum mechanics so the idea that crazy abstract ideas are going to be 
by popular culture is not foreign to me cz any tips sc well quantum epigenetic yoga might be a 
seller right there you go cz oh my god it it sc throw dark energy in there and be 
yachts any moment cz okay we need we need to patent that idea right now author the overlapping conversation 
okay i will edit this out of the podcast so no one hears it and steals our great idea 
it sounds like though even in principle if you handed a computer a complete list of the three billion 
pairs in our dna the gcta letters in our alphabet a computer with perfect knowledge that would not be 
to predict what the organism would look like it would be missing the mitochondrial dna it would be missing 
sorts of chemical signals that could be passed down through the body it sounds like learning how much of 
organism is predicted by that probably a lot but certainly not the whole thing cz yeah in a way 
is one of those deep questions in the history of biology how much of an organism is basically determined 
the very beginning and how much of an end result is just the emergence through development and as always 
answer is both but complicated in the sense that there are a lot of things that you can predict 
on dna those predictions are not i predict what color of shoes wearing right now today based on your 
sean but i bet if i looked at your dna i could get a pretty good idea what your 
color is and i might be able to make some very crude predictions about the influence of your genes 
your height i tell you how tall you are i know if your parents fed you properly sc right 
but there are things that you can predict out of dna but then this the dna the cells make 
or molecules from the genes and the cells are talking to each other and taking in cues from the 
cells are migrating through the body and all sorts of crazy stuff is happening and the genes are responding 
all of that and that is how we end up the way we are so yeah if i had 
genome sequenced sure nobody could make any predictions about me from that sc right i do want right i 
this from the book so when you say you had your genome sequenced so special here because you really 
the fullblown treatment if people do ancestrycom or or any of these things they get a little bit of 
about their genome but they do not get a list of three billion acgts right they get some subknowledge 
that do you actually have a print out of all three billion base pairs in your dna cz i 
not have a printout i have a hard drive sc okay metaphorical i was being metaphorical cz yeah well 
if i printed it out it would fill up dozens and dozens of books and that would be a 
art project sc you can use a small font okay cz yeah right and it would be kind of 
to do a search function on that sc true cz so i prefer to have it on that hard 
because then i can take it to scientists and say play around with this data here which just so 
to be my genome and show me how you discover things in human genomes by analyzing this sort of 
been a fascinating experience but it is a very different thing than getting your dna sequenced from a place 
what or ancestry does is they do something called genotyping basically they look at maybe a million markers a 
spots throughout your genome and they try they look at to see well which variant do you have at 
particular spot and so kind of a high level survey of your genome but you can learn an awful 
one of the reasons you can learn an awful lot is because we tend to share similar stretches of 
so if got a string of variants all in a row chances are that that whole segment of dna 
identical to somebody else that has those same variants sc right cz and so you can infer a lot 
in between those markers when you get your whole genome sequenced that means that trying to figure out as 
as you can every single letter in your genome and with that you can discover all sorts of deeper 
about your genome sc well and one of the deeper things you could discover is that you are susceptible 
even almost inevitably going to have some disease that might affect you at a certain time of your life 
so this question of what do we want to know if you the philosophers would come in and instantly 
the version of the question to ask is you could know you were going to die on exactly a 
day would you want to know that is that information you some much cruder version of that might be 
through this looking at our genomes cz that information is really only available to a small fraction of the 
who get their dna genotyped or get their genome sequenced because the genes that really have a strong impact 
your health say talking about genes that cause disease or genes that raise your risk dramatically of getting early 
genes that dramatically raise your risk of getting certain forms of cancer these are rare natural selection is not 
of these genes laughter sc for obvious reasons cz therefore rare when i got my genome sequenced the first 
of it was doing i did it as part of a conference and i think there were like forty 
who were going to this conference who also got their genome sequenced they getting the raw data but they 
getting these interpretations from clinical geneticists and there were like forty of us and if i recall correctly maybe 
five people were told gonna sit down with a genetics counselor and make some plans for you to talk 
your doctor because something you need to know sc how is your life insurance plan looking cz yeah right 
for the rest of us it was like you have anything that really jumps out is what they would 
nothing where like that gene big now i have plenty of genes that have been associated with raising my 
of this disease or that by some modest amount but that mean that gonna die of any of those 
i also have variants that lower the risk for certain diseases too sc right cz and and that is 
to be how most people are going most people are gonna find when they get their dna sequenced and 
to concerned that people not make one of two mistakes one mistake is to be angry and irritated that 
find anything in their genome like really sc my genome is much more interesting than making it out to 
yes cz well this a status thing not like you wanna go to the office and get terrible news 
like you feel you should feel happy if they say no fine see you and also the flip side 
that is that sometimes people will get in these reports or maybe do their own research and discover they 
a gene that is associated with some disease just say like colon cancer and they say my god it 
die of colon no no no you have to dig down that extra level and say exactly did this 
did it find that people who had this variant had a slightly higher risk of this disease and also 
big was this study a lot of these studies when preliminary is just like a hundred people tiny and 
studies are often wrong so there are plenty of mutations that were thought originally to cause diseases that we 
know do not so you gotta think about all these things when looking at these results and that gets 
to me and how i feel that our high school grade school genetics has just gotta step up its 
because these things are not just abstractions that you learn about in high school and never think about again 
are getting these results in their email inbox sc right but also it maybe an antiquated worry because recently 
bought new running shoes so i went to the nike website and they let you actually customize your own 
like what color is the front and what logo is on the bottom and stuff like that so within 
couple of generations have the website for doing that for our babies right just be able to pick what 
features we want them to have edit the dna and get whatever baby we want cz i am sure 
there will be people who are offering that if the laws allow i think that you will get the 
of your dreams i think your baby will just be your baby and will be subject to all the 
of experience and biology and all the rest of it but we already have all sorts of companies out 
that are offering really dubious claims based on looking at your dna looked at a few variants and say 
special exercise or your special dna even a company called vinome i know if seen them sc no cz 
will recommend wine to you based on your dna laughter sc sorry how do you spell that i actually 
to look this up what is this called cz yeah please do vinome vinome sc alright it could be 
podcast sponsor down the road i like it laughter cz well yeah you may not wanna play this episode 
when i saw a video for it i just thought this wait is this the onion this be but 
was and all these companies seem to be doing as far as i can tell is looking in the 
literature and saying like a variant where people who had it tended to report a stronger sensation for bitter 
than people who and then going from that to saying like take this pinot and with exercise a very 
thing yeah sure there are genes that are associated with all sorts of aspects of exercise the power in 
muscles or how much oxygen you take in and so on and sure that there is a genetic element 
great athletes being great but when i got my genome sequenced the company that gave me that first layer 
results before i took matters into my own hand actually they said like muscles are built for i was 
sc sorry i do not mean to laugh i was laughing at something completely separate that was happening here 
the room cz yeah sure sure no okay sean met me and anybody met me knows that my muscles 
not built for power just not the case but what they were doing is they were just looking at 
one variant and these limited number of studies and not taking into account all the other genes that influence 
muscles many of which we really understand so i do worry about letting folks like that who run these 
do the same thing with designing babies sc well tell us a little bit though about crispr and the 
of gene editing it is something that is brushing at us very very quickly right cz yeah yeah i 
became aware of crispr maybe six years ago or something and i can remember at first i was sort 
puzzled by it because actually crispr a natural thing what it is is basically an immune system for bacteria 
make molecules that can essentially store information about viruses and then use that information to create new molecules that 
zero in on particular stretches of virus dna and cut it and i thought cool microbes never cease to 
but then some scientists said we could use that and we could maybe cut whatever dna we and lo 
behold they could they could zero in on particular stretches of dna and make cuts and then substitute in 
dna and all of a sudden they had this very powerful new molecular tool at their disposal scientists use 
all the time now to do experiments cz they might say like wanna know which genes in a cancer 
are essential for it to survive as a cancer so they will just use crispr to systematically cut out 
single gene in individual cell lines and just see which ones survive as cancer you just do that before 
so the impact is unbelievable and then people are starting to say like can we use this to alter 
genes of crops or of and the answer is sc sure cz and so the next step is well 
can we do for people and one of the things you can potentially do for people is treat hereditary 
so if someone has sickle cell anemia you take some of their bone marrow cells out the stem cells 
make blood you tweak their dna so that they can now make hemoglobin that they need the proper kind 
hemoglobin sickle cell anemia is caused by a misshapen kind of hemoglobin and you put the cells back into 
and they make healthy blood cells the hope and there are clinical trials that could start very soon on 
and then the big frontier the one that understandably everybody gets excited and scared about is what if you 
use these on embryos and change genes in embryos and then you are creating an inherited change that will 
passed down through the generations sc right yeah gonna do it right so i have a kind of an 
point of view on this because people say people raise this question that you just raised we genetically edit 
on in the embryo and therefore change what the person is gonna be and a sort of instant reluctance 
like of course that would be bad or at least it might be bad we should think about it 
we should really be very but not quite sure where the reluctance comes from other than a sort of 
a sort of feeling that messing with nature and what i suspect is that some people will feel that 
some people will not feel that way and absolutely gonna happen and one hundred years from now the idea 
just making a baby by randomly picking half of the dna from mom and half the dna from dad 
hoping for the best will seem hopelessly barbaric cz well you and i are gonna have to hope that 
extension antiaging drugs advance really quickly so that we can make a bet and see if it pans out 
yeah cz but i have thought about these scenarios a lot partly just fun to think about and what 
fiction writers do so well and there are a lot of questions i have not as sanguine maybe is 
word as you are in the sense so for starters like crispr crispr is indeed revolutionary but turning out 
have some problems because people call it gene editing but editing that involves chopping dna and that is a 
radical thing to do to dna and cells like it the cells actually have all sorts of defenses against 
up dna because it can lead to all sorts of damage that can ultimately cause a descendants to become 
for example and not so there are concerns about just how safe crispr would be in terms of creating 
line of cells wanna put in your body through crispr you wanna put in cells that are gonna be 
prone to cancer problem number one problem number two a recent study that showed that sometimes when scientists try 
cut one particular segment of dna out they cut out a long stretch that includes that particular target and 
you might be cutting out pieces of dna that you really need and maybe when the dna is getting 
it gets kind of shuffled around in ways that could be a problem cz so okay so the safety 
and then also kind of the logistics issue if saying like this is so imagining a world are you 
a world where all say nine billion people all get in vitro fertilization in vitro fertilization is a very 
drawnout process right now it could get a lot better in the future but maybe not maybe there is 
inherent sort of limits to this so my point is it be you crispr alone would not deliver you 
that science fiction future have to have all sorts of other advances in reproductive technology and stem cell research 
all the rest of it before this could even be possible but i have talked to biologists who say 
look at crispr like vaccination in the sc right yeah so i i get absolutely the fact that not 
the next five years or ten years right we will have to extend our lives if gonna see this 
come true and also not sanguine in the sense that i think that not going to be unalloyed good 
look at this editing of our genomes as a technology like cars or twitter gonna be good parts about 
or bad parts about it i just think inevitable i just think that like we have jumped off of 
pier into the ocean and as we fall in debating we get wet or and just not a debate 
is very reasonable to have sc we can have other debates we swim for shore should we try to 
back up the pier should we fight off the but i think going to happen and people are gonna 
trying to alter their intelligence and skin color and size of their noses and everything and i think that 
of dropping the ball a little bit on dealing with what the implications of that really are gonna be 
well i guess the question becomes if people really are going to try to do this if they can 
we pass laws to prevent that or do we do we put regulations in place to allow certain uses 
it for certain things and then really shifting from a scientific question to a social or a political one 
for example dealing with that right now actually people realize it but genetically engineering humans has already begun because 
were talking about mitochondria before so mutations can cause mitochondria to become defective and so women can pass down 
mitochondria to their children and you can get these mitochondrial diseases which can be quite devastating and there are 
sorts of different ones that emerge from faulty mitochondria cz so some years ago people thought what if we 
to do a transplant an egg transplant take the dna and the nucleus of an egg and put it 
a donor egg that has good mitochondria in it obviously take out the nuclear dna out of the egg 
egg first but anyway so basically now you have an egg that has the nuclear dna the chromosomes and 
mitochondria and then fertilize that people call that threeparent babies laughter which is unfortunate but it stuck anyway sc 
again yeah cz we can debate about what it means to be a parent sc yeah cz but in 
case in the united states that has been banned no way gonna happen in the united states no way 
be research or evaluation of it forget it that is dead in the water right now and there was 
case of a doctor in new york who had done some research on this who actually went to mexico 
treat a couple who the mother had a mitochondrial disease and so and mexico have any laws one way 
the other about it so they did it kind of on secretly cz but meanwhile in britain they talked 
this very quite explicitly and had discussions in parliament and they said know what these diseases are so devastating 
we feel that this combination of mitochondria from one woman and chromosomes from another woman okay with that we 
that violates our human dignity and going to allow this to go forward under a lot of and so 
university in britain that has gotten the license open for business and so they will probably babies will start 
being born soon through this technology so i wonder gonna happen with crispr sc right cz will it be 
american version total ban will it be the mexico version like all kind of on an unregulated black market 
is it going to be out in the open carefully explicitly regulated under the guidance of government sc well 
i think being a little intentionally provocative here because i think that people a tendency for people either to 
sort of ask rhetorical questions and leave them hanging without quite answering them or this other tendency which we 
the united states love so much is just to ban it first and ask questions later for something like 
babies if it does become possible and obviously enormous scientific technical hurdles to getting there but i could easily 
that banned here and so okay someone sets up a clinic in mexico or the cayman islands or whatever 
rich people go there and design their babies and poor people do it sc or even if it get 
anywhere like you alluded to earlier just you can do it it costs a one dollars just how much 
effort is going to require and so a kind of inequality socially that is going to be hard to 
with a little it hits home in a way the ability to make sure all your children are tall 
beautiful that other kinds of inequality might not cz i have a problem with these arguments against crispr based 
inequality because they all make it sound like we are living in a paradise of equality today sc wait 
not cz if you are concerned about inequality like time to get started now because not as if genes 
the only thing that can influence the success of children later in life sc sure cz and this i 
think that this also raises difficult questions because if you say well wrong to let parents use crispr to 
their say and or whatever you want to dream that you could do with crispr i think that would 
but just pretend you could do that anyway okay so what about all the other advantages that children of 
parents have that help them to get ahead in life do we make those illegal should sat prep classes 
banned sc yeah no i think this is very real but i still think the analogy is not quite 
i get it and i think that we are a terrible society at treating people equally right now though 
point is very very well taken but in america at least people grow up with this idea that someday 
matter where you come from you could be a millionaire or you could be president but no one grows 
with the idea that twenty years from now my dna will be better so this kind of obvious in 
face difference between people which i suspect people will react to very viscerally cz i agree and i think 
of it is part of the problem here is that we think of genes as being the absolute definition 
who we are not but we also think about heredity in the sense that these kids will then pass 
these traits to their kids and so on and that really strikes a chord i think because like i 
saying before heredity is such a profound thing to us in terms of how we define ourselves and so 
be tampering with heredity seems like one of the great transgressions and that i think colors our discussion of 
and you can see this in the debates people have cz scientists who developed crispr actually have just in 
past few years had a series of international meetings to figure out like right wrong what should we do 
and the overriding issue it seemed was what is this gonna do to heredity which is so striking to 
because it really tells you where our concerns are located and i think a good question but on the 
hand i i some people say like gonna turn ourselves into two separate have the rich people who can 
crispr who will become their own species and the poor people will become a different species it sort of 
me of the time machine by hg wells sc very hg wells yes exactly right cz you know what 
about sc yeah cz but people just work that way animals in general work that way people have sex 
of sex and people respect these sort of arbitrary boundaries when having sex whatever genes might get introduced into 
rich person will either disappear entirely from the human gene pool eventually what happens to most gene variants or 
just kinda diffuse around all over the world after a while because of just the way that people have 
together so i just find some of these science fiction scenarios that people are talking about as if real 
questions to be silly frankly sc i think actually so gonna go on the other side i think that 
if wildly unrealistic and not mapping out the future i am glad people are envisioning the craziest most extreme 
i think will help us sort of be prepared a little bit for the brave new world yet to 
cz well no but you have to but okay yeah we can talk about these scenarios but then we 
to take the next step and say okay but here are the basic facts of science that tell you 
this is not even something worth sc sure cz for example i wrote an article for the times recently 
studies on dna and the link between genes and how long you stay in school there is a connection 
we really know why a connection there it may have to do with genes that influence certain things in 
brains or maybe even our brains we know but an association there interesting worth studying and you can actually 
at these million variants in dna and actually come up with a score a sort of education score which 
very fancy like well i could use that to test some and say like never gonna make it to 
so just gonna put you over here in this track and you just be content with your cz and 
would be a ridiculous thing to do because this score it only predicts a small amount of the variation 
how people do in school so chances are that your score would be very wrong so lots of people 
a high genetic score who drop out early from school there are a lot of people with a low 
score who go into grad school just one variable among several so for people to say like okay well 
gonna have this future where fate is well and not a scenario worth talking about just because of the 
statistics of what talking about so all for talking about scenarios but you have to be willing to throw 
out sc no i completely agree on that that idea that you just said about predicting educational attainments based 
their dna makes no sense to me like taking a preseason power poll in some sports league and then 
we need to play the games now we figured out going to but playing the games actually matters also 
carl zimmer or as we say around here carl for zimmer thank you very much for a wonderful conversation 
great to talk to you cz oh it was good talking to you again sean sc alright bye bye 
bye music interesting questions and interesting answers thoroughly enjoyable thank you for giving the space to expressshare the following 
three billion base pairs protein coding genes so the question of junk dna arises from httpsghrnlmnihgovprimerbasicsnoncodingdna once thought noncoding 
was with no known purpose however it is becoming clear that at least some of it is integral to 
function of cells particularly the control of gene it is interesting to note that before crispr technologies came into 
enzymes which have been used invitro in a tube called were discovered and used in mentioned this since the 
of genetic engineering came before editing in the lab but crispr has made editing possible invivo in a living 
transgenerational epigenetic inheritance the inheritance of epigenetic characters can certainly in much is due to the environment and the 
to which it happens in humans remain sorry to be trollish but this was a big disappointment such a 
topic why choose a science writer and not a scientist to discuss it with glad you pushed back on 
of the hypothetical problems with gene editing also realize you are toward the opposite end of the political spectrum 
people like greg cochran and steve hsu but after listening to this i can see why the former savaged 
book in a review and can only wish chosen the latter to speak with given how his work relates 
those hypotheticals zimmer was pretty dismissive of being able to read the trait of height from a dna i 
group has identified several thousand genes that affect it and have a model that predicts height from dna within 
cm or two and at the end he touched on the recent research tying genes to years of schooling 
if that were absurd of course the reason that was researched is because it correlates strongly with intelligence that 
paper was discussed by lead author james lee on the insight podcast you are obviously a brilliant guy and 
great communicator but i do regret that the podcast sometimes seems aimed a little lower than i expected when 
was announced hi sean someday could you do an indepth interview with kirk sorensen thorium sourced nuclear energy and 
lftr this prospect for energy is a game changer for humanity you have an excellent forum and we the 
wish you well pingback flowers and faux pas michelledevilliersartandstories great podcast thanks for putting these discussions together my brother 
i recently had a text message discussion about evolution and entropy by the end of our discussion we both 
the idea that evolution was a fundamental force of nature and if this idea were true then maybe life 
be an expected cosmological event and there should be a mathematical equation for life one of the things we 
was the observation of convergent evolution it seems like that phenomenon could be explained mathematically my brother and i 
not academics mathematicians or physicists we are both just curious minds who love to contue to understand our worlds 
and have a tendency to ask questions about it so i was wondering if you would dedicate a topic 
the phenomenon of evolution because i would love to hear the thoughts that you and others have on this 
maybe a discussion with jeremy england this is my new favorite podcast great stuff one question who did your
