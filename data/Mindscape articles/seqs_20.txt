i know if an analog in physics for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but
know if an analog in physics for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so
if an analog in physics for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this
an analog in physics for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this leads
analog in physics for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this leads into
in physics for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this leads into the
physics for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this leads into the real
for the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this leads into the real world
the kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this leads into the real world question
kind of person really obsessed with the frictions chuckle versus the kind of person sc a good question sn into the ideal into the frictionless model sc right right i mean you have to some people you have to do that but so this leads into the real world question of

problems that got now i just like it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations
that got now i just like it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so
got now i just like it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why
now i just like it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that
i just like it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological
just like it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological label
like it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological label is
it just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological label is some
just feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological label is some people
feels like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological label is some people see
like the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological label is some people see it
the history is borne out that a lot of those can be laid at the feet of policy reforms that were conducted in the name of neoliberalism in the and and even up and through the bush and obama administrations so why that ideological label is some people see it as
