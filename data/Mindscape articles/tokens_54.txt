hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today we have a cosmologist on the 
not just myself another cosmologist anthony aguirre who not going to be able to say this is giving you 
typical view of what cosmologists think about because anthony and i actually are much more sympathetic with each other 
our views of what are the important cosmological questions than we are with other cosmologists out there but okay 
podcast anthony has recently written a wonderful book called cosmological koans where he tries to introduce some of the 
features of our cosmological universe through the device of telling little zen koans if familiar with the idea of 
koan a little story that is supposed to bend your mind a little bit make you think about things 
are apparently paradoxical sc this is how the world works the world itself is not paradoxical but it can 
that way sometimes so thinking about those paradoxes drives you to interesting places and as a cosmologist it drives 
to think about things like entropy and information and what happened at the big bang do we live in 
simulation questions like this so those are the kinds of issues that anthony and i discuss in the podcast 
we get to interesting places because entropy and information are behind things like the existence of life in the 
why you remember the past and remember the future so do we live in a simulation these become interesting 
for human life as well as for studying the universe and at the end we mention the fact that 
has gone beyond studying the universe to actually found some organizations that worry about human life and where going 
so a very fun conversation we had to sort of bite our tongues because we wanted to rush forward 
know our common background but i think that we did a pretty good job of explaining things let me 
everyone that this is a podcast you can review it on itunes which we always love you can support 
on patreon and you can go to the website to find all the show notes and transcripts and things 
that preposterousuniversecompodcast thanks for all your support and go music sc anthony aguirre welcome to the mindscape podcast anthony 
thanks great to be here sc so you are a professional physicistcosmologist but even with a little real astronomy 
your background theoretical astrophysics anyway noncosmological stuff but written a book of koans not sure if pronouncing that correctly 
the little zen stories could you explain to us why a purportedly respectable cosmologist would write a book of 
koans aa purportedly respectable yes well it seemed like an interesting tool in the sense that what i really 
to write a book about were those strange fun tantalizing paradoxes that you run into as a physicist or 
a philosopher or just as a person who likes to think about things i think sort of nothing more 
in my actual job as a working cosmologist or physicist than coming across something where you think this is 
and this is also plainly true yet those two things totally contradict each other or this is true yet 
totally be and then you feel like you have sort of a puzzling mystery and i wanted to get 
sort of sense of that and that experience that i think we all have now and then of the 
and perplexity of the universe and also in a way that attached the physics ideas and concepts and thinking 
stories because people are storytelling creatures aa so the koan i had some experience with reading books of koans 
and had a sense of what they were about and a friend suggested it to me a koan is 
of this device both kind of a story kind of like a fable or a tale that encapsulate some 
in this case but also kind of a confrontation you should feel like i quite know what about or 
am i with this after reading the koan but then you go on and delve deeper into it sc 
so the point is that being a cosmologist is much like being one of these students being upbraided by 
zen master where the role of the zen master is played by the universe in this case aa yes 
experience that i certainly have as a cosmologist and as a physicist that you are constantly forced in this 
of being bewildered or not doing your job right i think where the fun is sc i sometimes try 
make the point that people sometimes object to this or that cosmological theory it feel right or disturbing or 
and i have to ask why that should be a criterion for anything at all aa i think right 
tricky thing because on the one hand physics when you learn how the universe is it often violates your 
that you had before but then you as a working scientist generate a new set of intuitions that go 
with the understanding that attained and that you really believe in so always that tricky is this violating my 
because not right and built up an intuition that is a good guide to true and not or is 
violating it because still stuck in some old erroneous intuition that just inherited from wherever not always easy to 
sc yeah because physicists definitely do and in fact should use some kind of intuition not all theories are 
equal we have a feeling that something is on the right track all the time and it is as 
said very very hard to convey that feeling or even to defend it in a court of law aa 
sc so why you start us off by giving us an example pick your favorite koan or at least 
good introductory koan from your book which is called cosmological koans aa okay well see do you want me 
just read one or just give you a sense sc yeah read one do your dramatic interpretation aa dramatic 
okay this one see trying to decide between the more zen one or the yeah do this one this 
is called the cosmic now and it goes like this it takes place here and now so i should 
that most of these things are kind of part of a story that takes place in the early century 
this one is an exception in that it takes place right here and now wherever that is aa and 
it goes it says now as you read this a baby in india is taking its first breath and 
old woman her last a young woman and her lover sharing their first kiss lightning flashes across a dark 
the wind blows through the hair of a solitary hiker in the sahara desert a satellite is seeing the 
rise above the earth a hurricane is blowing endlessly through the clouds of jupiter two rocks are colliding just 
in the third ring of saturn the new year is arising on a planet around a star in our 
perhaps the world has inhabitants who are celebrating our galaxy moves about one hundred miles closer to our neighbor 
toward their collision and union billions of years from now a star in a distant galaxy ignites a titanic 
explosion that ends its hundredmillionyear lifetime at the same time hundreds of new stars first ignite the observable universe 
enough space for a hundred new galaxies all of this is happening this very second across the universe right 
and yet this now across the does not sc as a straightforward western scientist i want you to say 
you mean it does not aa it does not exist so the point of this one sc i do 
know what you mean of course but aa you know what i mean of course but the point of 
we learned from special relativity that this idea that there is a single moment of now across the universe 
single meaningful time at which you say was the past before this time and it is the future after 
that that exists for an individual here and now observer like you experience a past and a future and 
now but such a thing have an objective existence across the universe what relativity tells us is that if 
attribute some moment of now spread out in space someone else can attribute an equally valid one spread out 
space that is different from the one that i have aa and so a lot of reasoning behind that 
where that truth arises from relativity but i think the point here in telling it that way was to 
to really bring that into that relativity truth which physicists pretty much all accept now and is sort of 
of the standard canon of physics into its violent clash with your intuition because your intuition is just screaming 
you like even if far away it either happened or it has happened that there is a truth of 
matter and by putting yourself in that mind of envisioning all of these things happening at farther and farther 
i think it sets up how very strange that really is even as a physicist you get used to 
oh no absolute now and fine and you know what the equations are in everything but when you really 
about it that is really really very strange sc a little bit of a tension i want to sort 
restore your reputation as a respectable cosmologist by talking about cosmology but i love this idea of using the 
because a bit of a tension between the presupposition of scientists that the world is ultimately logical and intelligible 
what i take to be the spirit of the koans which is that sometimes maybe not sometimes maybe you 
give up on the hope of making sense of everything do you think that something to take into mind 
yeah so i think interesting how different some of these different questions and confrontations play out in different ways 
there certainly are a good number where something puzzling like the fact that a wooden and an iron ball 
at the same rate and yet an elegant and in fact beautiful explanation for why that is in physics 
once you understand that you think that just really explained that and so there you it was puzzling but 
an explanation and you really have it and you feel good about that there are other ones where you 
like there probably is an explanation but we know what it is yet but we probably will get one 
feel good about it afterwards you things like quantum gravity for example very confusing how that is going to 
but i think we will have a theory of it at some point and feel good about it aa 
i think there is a class of questions where not clear whether the question is flawed or whether an 
answer when you ask things about probabilities in an infinite universe and things like that that you just quite 
if posing what feel like wellposed questions but getting ambiguous answers and it becomes rather unclear in your mind 
this actually a wellposed question or do i have to unask the question as some zen koans ask you 
do but if not that question what is it becomes very unclear what is the right question to ask 
i think there are some where i think we know what the right question is or whether the questions 
sense and then there are some where you feel like really asking a totally sensible question and just have 
idea what the answer is or if ever know like with the right view of interpreting quantum mechanics it 
pretty solid i feel like i understand what the issue is and just know and tuesday wednesday and thursday 
believe one thing and the other days the other thing sc oh worry i have a book coming out 
that that will fix all the problems and make everyone agree with the many worlds interpretation aa no i 
that savoring the mystery for the next few weeks until sc savor the misery you have a couple of 
to savor the mystery good but one of the wonderful things about the physics side of this so i 
your point that there are questions that we by our intuitive lights or our folk way of looking at 
world make perfect sense to us but maybe our experience with the universe teaches us that we should unask 
but the point is forced into that we try our best to understand the universe as it is and 
to these crazy ideas about it like no such thing as now so why we ground ourselves a little 
in the universe you mentioned relativity general relativity is the centerpiece of modern cosmology give us your short take 
what are the observational established facts about the universe that going to have in the background as we start 
a little bit aa well i think in terms well gravity and cosmology and of course those are intimately 
together in that gravity gives us the mathematical framework to finally describe the universe as a whole that was 
that really possible to do very nicely before we had theory but now we do and so we can 
that the universe that we see that we can directly observe is expanding and has been for the last 
years and is more or less uniform on large scales and this set of astronomical and cosmological observations that 
been fit together into this just remarkably explanatory model the standard cosmological model that happened during our lifetimes we 
witnesses and in some small way a part of this and really quite astonishing how successful that is like 
standard model of particle physics that the real challenge is finding something that get explained reasonably well by it 
sc yeah tough times for theorists when your theory is doing too well aa right right really fun for 
while and then you get really good answers to a lot of questions and pat yourself on the back 
suddenly you realize that made your job really hard because once you have a really good there are always 
of things sort of unexplained in detail like how galaxies form in detail and you can spend a lot 
fun time and energy understanding that process better but a different question from are there things that are sort 
fundamentally at odds with or sort of have no viable explanation within cosmology and we still have those things 
the form of dark matter and dark energy in the sense that we really know what those things are 
we do know their properties quite nicely and once you suppose these few properties you explain an awful lot 
so i think interesting that for a book like this one or just for a topic that the whole 
which is ultimately quite mysterious in a lot of ways that nonetheless come so far in understanding in quantitative 
on the very largest scales we can observe and every timescale that we can observe we have a pretty 
picture of that sc okay but share with our listeners what the actual statement of the standard cosmological model 
how big bang expanded the universe dark matter dark energy that stuff aa yeah so the universe actually i 
one of my rules by talking about the start of the universe when no need to sc yeah i 
to say anything chuckle aa but the part of the universe that we observe billion years ago was an 
hot plasma nearly uniform expanding filled with a tiny bit of normal matter baryons protons neutrons and electrons and 
contribution of dark matter and some contribution very small of dark energy and since then that expanding gas has 
and rarefied it was nearly uniform so the nonuniformities in that gas grew by selfgravity into large complicated structures 
now galaxies and clusters of galaxies and within them stars and planets and things aa meanwhile the universe went 
several transitions where in the beginning it was more or less dominated by just radiation light as time went 
that transitioned into being dominated by matter and now in this period where the overall sort of expansion of 
universe is dominated by this mysterious dark energy associated with empty space and so we have this picture of 
nearly uniform expanding universe that has evolved in time that has kind of an early middle and late phase 
it kind of in the middle phase and a sort of explanation for where the structures that we see 
galaxies down to planets and even the origin of the elements that things are made of we have a 
of origin story for all of those different things within this cosmology again details not worked out but broad 
kind of understanding in place sc so can i make a controversial claim right off the bat here aa 
sc i think dark that mysterious chuckle i think that we like to describe it that way but if 
think about dark matter think about dark matter and dark energy and i want you to explain a little 
more of what those are and why we know that there but a lot of different candidates for what 
dark matter is in an information theoretic pointofview the entropy of dark matter is high in the sense that 
know what it is whereas we kind of know what the dark energy is a cosmological constant i would 
greater than odds on that the energy inherent in empty space itself so i think we should stop calling 
energy mysterious it was surprising at the time in one thousand nine hundred ninetyeight when we found it but 
probably know what it is unless some big surprise coming up in the future aa i certainly agree that 
matter is sort of unexplained but not at all particularly mysterious in that there are lots of candidates and 
you say why should everything the universe is made of happen to interact with light in ways that make 
not dark matter actually on record predicting that there will be multiple kinds of dark matter sc ooh bold 
that actually has started coming true if you count neutrinos and we can imagine sc are you going to 
neutrinos as a victory for your prediction aa no no laughter aa take it as a tiny little bit 
data but a real victory would be multiple sort of interestingly different ones anyway i think i agree that 
would put good odds against dark energy being anything other than a vacuum energy cosmological constant the mystery i 
as you point out is not that there is such a thing but that the mystery is how to 
sense of its value and what that tells us about the constitution of the universe as a whole in 
the natural value for the energy associated with empty space is absolutely not zero no particular reason to think 
there was a time when we could imagine that there would be such an argument and people searched for 
but they never came up with a good one and then we realized that that argument would be wrong 
it was sc yeah it work aa because it is not zero sc the made arguments i was very 
in my convictions you won a lot of money off of me in the early if you had bet 
about whether there was a vacuum energy or not aa from a lot of people yeah a lot of 
could have been collected from lots of people including me i think in fact the first paper that i 
was trying to disprove the cosmological constant observations sc worse than me okay good laughter aa so with you 
the natural value for it is some absurdly large number like characteristic of the planck scale or the super 
scale or something like that just absurdly larger than the value that we observe sc just be kind to 
listeners and tell them what it is in this sense what do you mean when you say cosmological constant 
so it is the energy that you have when you say that there are no particles in some region 
space so important to keep in mind is that when you say a photon a particle of light what 
really are talking about is an excitation of the electromagnetic field and if you say there are no photons 
means there are no excitations but the field is still there and the same thing with any other particle 
or protons or quarks or whatever those things are excitations of fields that still remain in place just you 
that in their unexcited or vacuum state if there are no particles around but no particular reason to think 
that unexcited state has zero energy with it any more than if you have an ocean and there are 
waves in it that are excitations on the surface of the ocean you might have an unexcited region of 
ocean but that mean there something very important about the water there just unexcited water aa so once you 
away the particles and the excitations still these fields around and no particular reason to think that the energy 
unit volume the sort of density of energy in the fields is zero so if you take away the 
there still might just be energy and what we call vacuum energy sc and what we purportedly measured back 
because it made the universe accelerate aa exactly sc and so i think the last thing going to start 
about the edges of the observable universe pretty soon so just remind the audience that we are in fact 
empiricallybased scientists and explain why we think there is dark matter what the difference is between dark matter and 
energy i think that still a lot of people out there probably not mindscape listeners but you know out 
in the world who think the dark matter is just cosmologists covering up for their mistakes and probably something 
simpler behind it all aa yeah so there was a time when the reason to think that there was 
matter was because galaxies have the dynamics you would expect given the stars that you can see and the 
that you can see in the galaxy so you would say basically a spinning ball or disk of stars 
gas i can see how much stars and gas there are i can use laws to tell me how 
motion should be given newtonian gravity and that mass and i see that their motions are not actually like 
the motion seems to indicate that more mass there than you can see in the stars and and if 
was the only thing that you saw a reasonable thing would be to say maybe something there that you 
reasonable thing would be to say there might be something wrong with those laws of gravity in this new 
that so back in the early century there was a discrepancy like this with the orbit of mercury people 
that there were some extra dust clouds or something in the solar system that caused this perturbation in the 
of mercury that accounted for by newtonian gravity aa turned out newtonian gravity was wrong and this was one 
the pieces of evidence for relativity so it could be that such a thing was an indication that gravity 
wrong but this has become not a really viable explanation for dark matter anymore so the time when it 
just about galaxies is long gone we have observations of galaxies clusters of galaxies gas clouds throughout the universe 
socalled microwave background radiation that tells us how gravity related to sort of variations in the density of radiation 
matter in the very early universe got all kinds of different gravitational lensing all kinds of different pieces of 
all of which are explained by one assumption that there is this dark matter which is a gravitating but 
noninteracting component to the universe with like five or six times as much density as normal matter protons and 
and electrons aa once you make that assumption all of these things are explained very very elegantly quantitatively on 
other hand if you try to explain it away with modifying gravity or come up with a viable theory 
gravity that is different and explains all these things extraordinary really difficult to do that and i think there 
anything believable at this point that also even have dark matter in it sc yeah as for the cosmic 
background radiation in particular i think essentially impossible to do it without invoking dark matter aa yes sc so 
so we have a universe we have a standard cosmological model another one of these terribly dry and boring 
for a magnificent edifice laughter aa yes sc and it does a pretty good job of explaining the universe 
the last billion years from the beginning of the observable universe to today so i want to talk about 
the far far past to the big bang and maybe even before but also the future go to the 
first what happens is the universe going to recollapse is it going to expand forever what are your feelings 
aa yeah this i kind of only one thing that this really depends on which is whether the dark 
changes so if it really is a fixed cosmological constant like you and i would both bet that it 
then the future looks pretty boring at least in the local region but boring on a very long timescale 
think it has to be kept in mind that although hear that sort although dark energy is taking over 
dynamics of the universe as a whole now and going to make astronomy and extragalactic cosmology kind of boring 
the next ten billion years or so start to just see many many fewer galaxies out there near us 
that piece that is attached to us and will be in our absorbable universe for the long term because 
bound to us still has just trillions and trillions of years to go aa so i think a very 
future in some sense sort of halfway through the age of the universe in that the characteristic age of 
universe is in the ten billion year range and so kind of middleaged in that sense but a really 
really long retirement package that comes with the universe of just many many trillions of years and depending on 
sorts of energy sources you think that we might exist around whether longlived low mass stars or more exotic 
like black holes it could be just exponentially long times that we have ahead of us so a slightly 
thing that that the universe will go on for so long i think sc and so explain a little 
about the dark energy not going away i think that something kind of mysterious ordinary matter dilutes away but 
matter aa dark energy sc dark energy sorry going to get going to be kicked out of the club 
aa yeah that is in fact its characteristic attribute is that it go away when you make the space 
because associated with empty space if you make empty space twice as big you just get twice as much 
it rather than it being sort of a enumerator like you have an amount of stuff divided by an 
of space here you have an amount of space divided by an amount of space and just nothing nothing 
so it a strange substance and it talk about this presumably but one of the really neat things about 
energy is that it just seems to cheat a little bit in that you take this amount of dark 
and you let it expand which it wants to do because the other property of the stuff is that 
forces sort of an expansion of spacetime it causes a repulsive force that pushes spacetime apart so it wants 
expand and in doing so it makes more of itself so kind of this endlessly selfcreating substance that i 
has no real analog outside there are metaphors you can make but i think nothing else really like it 
least in the physical world maybe there are things in economics that are somehow similar or something sc but 
violate conservation of energy sure this is what people are thinking right now aa yeah and that is one 
the most fascinating things is and maybe we should get to talking a little bit about the early universe 
this is one of the coolest stories ever i think is how all of this stuff that we see 
in principle without violating anything come from almost nothing so a story i think just an amazingly fascinating one 
built up where you can start with just a tiny little bit of this vacuum energy and that vacuum 
wants to make more of itself so it expands and creates a large volume with lots of energy associated 
it so created all this energy and you think wait a minute creating but energy conservation is a tricky 
especially in general relativity so there are different stories i think you can tell as to how this makes 
one story i think you can tell which i think is not a bad story is sc let me 
butt in to say that when we say stories you can tell these are all stories that are translated 
the original math right aa right sc there the math is absolutely crystal clear and the only question is 
are the best words to attach to it to make ourselves feel better aa well mostly crystal clear in 
case i think as agree so something totally clear which is that energy can be positive or negative and 
zero can be a sum of a big positive number and a big negative number so at least in 
you can imagine can take something with zero energy and turn it into some combination of positive and negative 
and a useful way i think of looking at this process where gravity provides negative energy so if you 
a gravitational attraction between two objects and put them on a scale the two objects together will weigh just 
little bit less very very very little less than the two objects weighed separately because the gravity between them 
has negative energy and that counts as mass and so they have a little bit less mass when close 
and you can imagine the sc which you can tell because it would take energy to pull them apart 
it would take energy to pull them apart yes and you can get a little bit of energy out 
letting them move together so and the universe plays this trick so in contemporary cosmological models the universe just 
exploits this trick to create a just massive amount of positive stuff and negative gravitational energy that exactly compensates 
balancing the books nicely with zero energy to the entire universe and this totally feels like cheating but not 
it does chuckle aa totally allowed by mathematics and i think when you have something that has such a 
and sort of elegant explanatory power but also is just totally what the math tells you is allowed but 
violates your intuition that i think is a fun thing when you say so sure that nothing can come 
of nothing or that you have a whole bunch of stuff coming out of nothing and yet physics just 
you exactly how you can do exactly that a great thing to learn sc yeah so not only is 
okay if the universe expands and there seems to be more and more vacuum energy but the whole universe 
potentially have exactly zero energy and therefore be the kind of thing that could exist or not exist without 
conservation of energy aa right sc alright so i do want to get there up to you i want 
ask about the future because you painted this bleak picture and i want to know exactly how bleak it 
the so not only are the sun is going to burn out its nuclear fuel a matter of a 
billion years but everything is going to go away all the other galaxies are going to disappear aa everything 
bound to us at the moment is going to disappear yeah so the region of the universe that will 
sort of connected together will be sort of limited now going to assume as i think probably should be 
but we really know that no faster than light travel or worm holes left over from the big bang 
we can sneak between or through are going to exist so we really will be limited by the speed 
light so that means that our descendants or whatever is in our galaxy looking around billions of years from 
will have just a smaller sort of set of stuff to play with than we do in the sense 
they be able to go to visit other galaxies and come back to report or even reach some of 
other galaxies on the other hand if you were to imagine humanity cracking out into the galaxy and even 
to neighboring galaxies and continuing to go to neighboring galaxies a great deal of stuff that we could eventually 
so i think starting now is essential in this program sc but if thinking big everything in the galaxy 
going to fall into a black hole and eventually evaporate away long term i should say aa in the 
long term yeah in the very long term i gave a name to these sort of timescales in the 
of kalpas which is ten to the like three digit number or ten to the ten to the multipledigit 
so these are sort of timescales that are so long that they sort of make every other timescale that 
care about ridiculously short in comparison to them so yes on those sorts of timescales there is a pretty 
future i guess i feel if the question is this a cause for sort of some sort of existential 
know really i think what the universe will look like in our sort of conceptualization what will be possible 
a thousand or a million let alone a trillion years from now i think despite my faith that we 
have understood lots of fundamental things about the universe i want to have a little bit of humility and 
that there may be lots more to it that even us great cosmologists still understand sc well okay interesting 
i want to be more hubristic i guess than you in the following sense the universe is going to 
emptying out and as you said some things are going to be bound together so if it for certain 
you could imagine that the earth would remain existent for infinity years even though other galaxies far away that 
would lose sight of but i think that there are other factors i think things like the second law 
thermodynamics which i know also a big fan of i think that life requires a source of low entropy 
order to keep going and sort of a buzz wordladen sentence and maybe you can unpack it but i 
that if you believe that then eventually be done be no way for life to continue to exist forever 
yeah so i think sort of the classical view of the socalled death of the universe that we reach 
kind of maximum entropy state and i think that probably true at some level but i think there are 
lot of subtleties to these questions once you delve into them so i do wonder and this is something 
i think is worth talking about well yeah maybe worth backing up a little bit and saying talking about 
the second law of thermodynamics means and is and what entropy is because i think that the idea that 
will sort of run its course and will come into equilibrium and then nothing interesting will happen again is 
true aa but at the same time we also knew that somehow the universe started with this tremendously low 
and tremendously large amount of information we have no explanation for how that happened and it could be that 
we understand if there is an explanation for that if we were to understand it it might shed new 
on that longterm question about the future as well i simply know sc what you mean by this is 
no explanation that everyone accepts there have been proposed explanations aa i think there are yes no explanation i 
that has the air of convincingness that for example the explanation for where all the stuff came so i 
two sort of fundamental mysteries if you talk about ultimate origins where did all this stuff come from and 
did all the information come from because a way to think about low entropy is lots of information so 
universe sort of started out with this huge endowment of matter and also this huge endowment of information and 
both of those things are still around the information is a little bit different in that in some sense 
in some description and we can get into this it gets used up the second law entropy increases and 
information is kind of going away whereas the matter kind of sticks around although in less and less useful 
in some sense but at any rate the universe started out with this huge endowment of each which is 
foundation of everything that exists in the universe now aa the stuff forms the galaxies but the information allows 
galaxies to form it allows all kinds of entropyincreasing processes which are every interesting process to occur otherwise we 
just be in this very boring equilibrium state where nothing interesting happens so in those twin mysteries of origins 
think we have actually a pretty good explanation on the stuff side the one that we discussed that you 
get it all out of nothing and we have descriptions for where the different kinds of stuff came from 
the baryons came from there are at least candidates for them but i think we have no such convincing 
as to where all the information came from other than sort of just assuming that it was there sc 
think we should dig into a little bit more what entropy is what information is and how related because 
think that if you tell people that there was a lot of information in the early universe going to 
that there were a lot of hard drives and books and things like that so clearly you mean something 
different than that aa right right and not like that and it feels paradoxical also because the early universe 
so boring and simple and yet we say that there was a lot of information to it this is 
talking about it and difficult to talk about with entropy is that entropy is a very dangerous term in 
people even professionals say it to each other meaning quite different things and when they tell each other i 
this sort of entropy or that sort of then they understand each other but nonetheless a complicated term aa 
way i think of it i think of entropy as being two rather distinct concepts that people call entropy 
can be connected one concept of entropy might be called sort of randomness that if you have a set 
possible ways a system can be you say got these different states that it can have but you know 
one in so you have some ignorance for some reason about what state the system is in you can 
probabilities to the different states the system is in and entropy is kind of a measure of how uncertain 
are about those states so if the system is in exactly one state and you know that then you 
assign zero entropy to it no randomness to it you know what exactly what it is if you assign 
probability to every one of the states like you have no clue what state the system is in then 
would say maximum entropy and you could say that equilibrium though i think a slightly different way of thinking 
it sc so for the air in the room for example given that all spread out i have no 
where any individual molecule is and high entropy but if i knew it was all hiding in the corner 
all the air was in one corner i would know something about each individual molecule i would have that 
aa yes but like these concepts are related but i think getting into the second definition of entropy that 
to come to after sc oops chuckle aa i think again there are relations between them but i think 
conceptually somewhat distinct things one is how much you know about the state of the room and this is 
directly connected to information in the sense that when you learn something about a system you have information about 
so if i say i know anything about the room or i know anything about the system equal probability 
anything but then i go and make a measurement and i say not in these states over here in 
so let me assign zero probability to those states that i know it and greater probability the ones that 
know it then changed its entropy the entropy is now lower for the system that i would assign to 
and i have information about it aa a useful way to think about information is the difference between the 
or the randomness entropy that a system has and the maximum possible randomness information entropy that it would have 
you can show that this is exactly what we mean when we say you have four bytes of information 
something like that that you can correspond those exactly so one information theoretic sense of entropy and this is 
all the time talking about communication and computer processing and all sorts of things where we talk about bits 
information exactly that concept aa now another concept which is the one that you just alluded to which is 
a whole bunch of states that a system might have but i want to label them in different ways 
are of interest to me so i might if i were in a kitchen say there are lots of 
ways that my kitchen might be but some of them are clean and some of them are not quite 
clean and some of them are pretty messy and some of them are super messy and so i could 
each state that the kitchen might possibly have one of those labels and what i would find is that 
are just in general if a normal person very very few clean states the kitchen can have relative to 
many dirty states the kitchen can have and this is a rather different thing that choosing these labels physicists 
call them macro states and assigning each state the kitchen can have each detailed state the kitchen can have 
one of these macro states aa now what you then find is sort of evidently if you then move 
kitchen from one state to another more or less at random like you just go and putter around in 
kitchen or let your kid make a meal or something they will randomly move the state of the kitchen 
one state to another and because there are lots more dirtyish states than cleanish states it will tend to 
dirtier and dirtier that is the kitchen will just wander into a state of more dirtiness because there are 
many more of them so this sense of entropy which you might call genericness or disorder or something really 
a little bit distinct in that it has to do with the way that for some reason we label 
actual states of the kitchen into these macro states or these collections which have very very different sizes and 
collections are sort of summaries for our use of useful for me to call all these states clean and 
these dirty for some aa now interesting about these two notions of entropy is that one of them has 
second law and is the thing that we talk about when we talk about the second law of thermodynamics 
second one the first if i just say here are the states that the kitchen have and i have 
of them and i let the system evolve then if the kitchen is a closed system and if the 
of physics are what a physicist would call unitary but we can call time reversible like if we could 
the clock forward and backward in those laws sc deterministic right aa deterministic yeah then that entropy will be 
that is no second law of entropy increase just entropy is a fixed quantity sc the information you have 
the system remains the same aa the information remains the same because it go away if it did you 
never be able to get back that information by just evolving the laws of physics back so these two 
of entropy one of them tells you that information in your description of something is preserved if you keep 
of it by carefully evolving the laws of physics the other tells you that the information that you have 
the sort of description that you have about a system about its dynamics in terms of these different collections 
coarsegrained description that you have that goes away in the sense that the entropy increases the system gets more 
more generic unavoidably and your handle on the system disappears and the second law of thermodynamics in action aa 
inevitable in the sense that inevitable to the degree that the variables that the smearing that you want to 
as a big coarsegrained macroscopic observer is something that the fundamental laws that are evolving the state of the 
care about those laws are very simple they know anything about clean and messy kitchens and because they know 
about each other they inevitably have to drive you to these more and more generic states and entropy increases 
i think important to distinguish those two although there are relations that we could go into but not sure 
worthwhile and that second one that is the thing that is where the information is going away where the 
sorry you have to remind us which the second one is you have to remind us which is the 
one and which is the second one chuckle aa well yeah so the genericness one the disorder one that 
increasing even while in some sense if there were a entropy of the universe in terms of the probabilities 
its states that would just be sitting there information will be preserved sc so a sense in which the 
universe was very orderly and what we mean when we say that it was low entropy so what is 
relationship there then with information because you said that there was this large amount of information we had aa 
so again i if you think of the orderliness you can also think of it a gap between how 
something could be and how disorderly it is right now and call that order or specificity or something and 
is the thing that is going away as the universe ages or as any physical system ages is entropy 
and so the universe was endowed with a tremendous amount of that whatever that you want to call that 
at the beginning and we know that because watched that order decay away as the second law has unfolded 
the history of the universe there are lots of processes that we can see that are using up that 
sc stars shine black holes form we breathe yeah aa things clump together the grass grows people metabolize stuff 
this chain you can see from that early order to clumping stars starlight plants people eating it and metabolizing 
and ultimately using that primordial store of order every time we eat something and that eating allows us to 
out of going to equilibrium as a nice closed physical system our tendency if just left to our own 
would be to go to higher entropy that is very bad for a living system to go to a 
higher entropy than it is so we have to maintain the entropy that we have and we do that 
ingesting stuff that has information content to it and giving off waste that has much less information or much 
entropy off into our environment and so we not a closed system a kind of an open system but 
stay in sort of an enduring macroscopic configuration that we call a living thing despite the laws of physics 
us to go to higher entropy sc i think something confusing to me i do think i understand this 
but very properly drawing a distinction between the information way of thinking about entropy and the disorderliness way of 
about entropy but then you say the universe is low entropy at early times in the messiness sense and 
for life existing but then you switch to saying well we ingest high information food aa i probably should 
said high order foods in that case sc okay good then suddenly everything makes sense again good so yeah 
this is worth emphasizing that life itself is a process that both relies on and assists with the tendency 
the universe to increase in its disorderliness aa yes so i think both so if you had no entropy 
i think you have living systems in the sense that the things that we actually do the metabolism that 
do are all entropyincreasing processes but i also think fair to say that a lot of what metabolism is 
is maintaining homeostasis in the face of this tendency to go to disorder and the only way to do 
is to embed ourselves in a larger orderly system and consume some of that order in order to maintain 
homeostasis sc does this run aa and that larger orderly system is the sunlight and the biosphere and the 
beyond that that has much more order has a big reservoir of order to it that we are allowed 
make use of sc would you say that this suggests a kind of entropic explanation for why the early 
had low entropy because without that low entropy we be here talking about it aa certainly true whether an 
or not i think is a longer discussion chuckle aa but yes certainly true that i sc if you 
to give a yes or no answer aa i think probably true that if you just had an equilibrium 
in the most generic state that you a lot of words to hedge here for reasons that i think 
well understand that you certainly have a world like we experience it i would say and i think mostly 
at the same time a lot of tricky business to entropy in the following sense so and this has 
do with what we might call indexical information sc that aa so that so suppose you have a bunch 
ants in a big ant farm or something now you could describe properties of these ants like they tend 
have this sort of speed walking around they tend to have this much food in their stomachs or whatever 
properties of the ants and you could then attribute an entropy that was connected to those statistical properties and 
could say that how much information we have about this big collection of ants right and that would be 
amount of information but now suppose you pick out a particular ant so now you have a bunch of 
statistical distributions you have particular properties of that ant so that a lot more information associated with that particular 
than there is with a whole group of ants because the whole group of ants has statistics which are 
vague an individual ant has a very precise number so a lot of information sc a lot more uncertainty 
the group yeah aa now the weird thing is you take a bunch of ants each of which has 
of information associated with it you put them all together and you get something without much information associated with 
so this is a strange thing about information not quite additive in that sense you take a whole bunch 
individual high information things and put them together and you get something that is lower information and similarly you 
sc i mean because you forgot something right because aa because you yes yes because you keep track sc 
ant is which aa if your collection of ants was your full description of each individual ant then still 
all that information but once you start to treat it as a collection you lose that sc yeah aa 
now the information that we so as as i individually look out into the universe a particular point of 
that i have and associated with that are a bunch of very particular things about the universe a particular 
that in the particular planet that on in a particular galaxy and so on so a whole bunch of 
that is associated with me right if i take the description of the universe as a whole not clear 
that information is still there what the universe as a whole might have are things like how many planets 
tend to be around a star and how many stars there are in a typical galaxy and things like 
so you can imagine that the universe as a whole might actually have very little information content because all 
really has are statistics whereas when i take a particular view of the universe my view a ton of 
associated with that sc sure aa and that is both sort of clear and also weirdly paradoxical because it 
has that feeling of creating a whole bunch of information from nowhere right where did it come from it 
came from being me chuckle aa and very easy to do sc yeah aa like almost no effort when 
think about the ultimate origin of the sort of information in the universe and is there a cheat similar 
the cheat that we got in creating the origin of the matter sort of where i look like is 
a way in which we can get a whole lot of information for free even though from another standpoint 
seems like there really much information and so i think at some level true but i think that an 
at the moment for where the information in the universe comes from but if there were an explanation i 
that might be some aspect of it sc i mean my answer would have been that the entropy of 
early universe was way lower than it ever needed to be for any simple entropic argument so this comes 
the idea that if you were an equilibrium if the universe was just the cosmological equivalent of a big 
of gas at high entropy there could be fluctuations right heard people talk about this idea of fluctuating into 
lonely brain floating in the cosmos the boltzmann brain aa i thought we agreed we going to talk about 
sean sc no you agreed on it aa okay chuckle great sc that is not you really agree we 
not share our mutual information aa i thought i agreed that i would not chuckle sc no you actually 
be very very technical you said you were happy to talk about it just annoying so i took as 
as assent aa okay i stand by that sc but providing a service here at mindscape we know that 
out there in the audience have heard of boltzmann brains if you think annoying and be a big part 
science then please tell us why but first please tell us what the idea is aa no annoying annoying 
multiple levels and part of annoying is of course interesting i should specify when i say something is annoying 
a lot of the projects that worked on and found most fruitful in my career have been born of 
very annoyed at something so this is not necessarily a negative thing ultimately and boltzmann brains are one of 
things that i think almost anyone who thinks about them would agree that annoying yet also provocative and interesting 
so the notion here is that if you imagine a system that is in equilibrium the statement was that 
is boring kind of informationfree it just sits there all of its properties follow from the fact that just 
equilibrium and yet we also know if we think about the kitchen that the kitchen will just stay messy 
forever but if you let your kid mess around in the kitchen long enough they might accidentally clean something 
chuckle aa and it might go down in entropy a little bit and so any equilibrium system is like 
it will from time to time sort of accidentally wander into a lower entropy more ordered state and so 
can imagine saying yes we live in an orderly universe but maybe it just wandered into that orderly aa 
no mystery there we the universe is in equilibrium but it occasionally wanders into an orderly state and we 
ourself in one of those orderly states and so the boltzmann brain argument is pointing out the flaw in 
reasoning which is essentially that the universe that we actually see and infer is out there using science and 
means is way way way way way lower in entropy that is a much much bigger fluctuation if it 
one than is necessary to account for our just first person experience of existing as a thinking being all 
it would take to exist as a thinking being is a single brain or some simple not simple some 
complex but small on a cosmic scale system like a brain it could think here i for a moment 
in fact it could account for any set of first person perceptions that you might imagine you can imagine 
physical system that would have that set of perceptions and whatever that is sc like i see a galaxy 
see the cosmic microwave background all of that background conversation aa whatever you postulate this is the data that 
want to explain you can imagine a very very small system like a brain that would observe that data 
then nothing more interesting after a very short time that experience would very radically diverge from the experience that 
have in the world as as having originated in a sensible cosmology like we do now viewpoints of this 
a little bit some people would say the assumption that a boltzmann brain kind of makes a prediction which 
immediately falsified by the fact that the universe goes on and disassemble into chaos or something one point of 
you can also say something like really a boltzmann brain then we know anything and we trust our reasoning 
trust our perceptions we trust just a selfundermining way of thinking like not a consistent thing to think because 
reason to even trust that my memory of two seconds ago when i was talking has any reality to 
i think but what people agree on i think is that entropy fluctuation downward simply is not a viable 
for how we found ourself in the low entropy state we find ourselves in at least not in and 
itself sc sorry sorry yeah so sorry not just that not individually boltzmann brains or something like that but 
live in a boltzmann universe aa right right so the boltzmann brain is really just a kind of reductio 
absurdum for thinking that the universe as a whole fluctuated down into a low entropy state and i think 
actually is would be a lot less confusing not to talk about brains but just to talk about the 
and then probably be a lot less arguments chuckle sc probably aa a fun thing to think about sc 
but so where does it leave us we agree that life what you and i think of as life 
certain process going on in a complex system here on earth maybe elsewhere relies on the fact that we 
in this very low entropy universe where entropy is increasing a little bit where we get food from and 
we make interesting things it may or may not go on forever i would say it go on forever 
think you eventually reach high entropy you want to be more cautious about that i really argue with that 
know why it started low in the very very early universe these are facts or at least are very 
arguments what do they teach us about cosmology what are the lessons that we can draw for how we 
be thinking about the universe and what the job of professional cosmologists should be aa well an interesting question 
step i think is to ask even if we get a full answer to where did the information come 
or why did we start in low entropy we might get a partial answer in the same way that 
got at least a partial answer to where did all this stuff come from we talk much about inflation 
we talked about it without naming it inflation inflation is a vacuum energy dominated early phase of the universe 
would be the name for the process where all of the stuff came from by reproducing lots of space 
of energy inflation also does things on the entropy front which are a little bit more controversial but what 
think it uncontroversially does is create a lot of region of space which looks like low entropy as long 
you worry about the spacetime degrees of freedom aa if you just think about the matter that is in 
what inflation does is make a nice big uniform chemically simple state of matter that is very very low 
and that is the state from which you can generate lots of order that comes later in the form 
stars and interesting chemistry and all of that stuff i think a sense in which inflation is a crucial 
in understanding how information and order and its generation and usage actually could have happened in the universe without 
being an ultimate answer to the question of where did all the order come from i think a much 
thing to assess with inflation sc as a good bayesian what is your percentage chance what is your prior 
inflation actually happened in our universe aa sc alright down to like percent more skeptical than you are i 
that you alluded to this very quickly but maybe for the listeners out there we should emphasize inflation does 
to create the kind of universe that we live in but only at the cost of assuming a very 
low entropy condition to begin inflation in the first place so pushed the mystery back more than solving it 
pushed the mystery back though i would claim that we really know how to specify what the entropy of 
when you say inflation had to be a very very low entropy state i think we quite know how 
actually rigorously define that entropy that would be low sc well if you think that it was low entropy 
the end of inflation and you think that entropy magically went down you must think that it was even 
before inflation aa right so assuming that there is a thing called entropy and that it still has a 
sc yeah right aa and therefore it inevitably had to be lower earlier all you can ever get but 
the assumption you sort never going to get out of the mystery sc oh i think you can aa 
yeah so if yes if you assume that the information the universe is simply endowed with an infinite amount 
order then true that no matter how much you use up still an infinite amount left so whether that 
a satisfactory explanation is probably a longer conversation for another time that would be great fun to have sc 
we do both agree that this is a big puzzle for cosmology and i think that to help our 
out there in the minority in some sense this is not one of the questions that most working cosmologists 
bring up as one of the big puzzles trying to look at aa true but i think vastly underappreciated 
that sense because it really is the ultimate question of where everything comes from in a way because everything 
a large sense i think is made up of this order all of the things that we describe all 
stars and planets and things the thing that makes them all possible is this reservoir of order that we 
from the early universe otherwise everything would just be super boring and so this growth of entropy or this 
of order throughout cosmic history is driving every interesting process that everybody cares about sc quite a big deal 
so in that sense a vastly underappreciated and super important topic as sure you would agree having spent lots 
time thinking about it but true that brushed under the rug in comparison to i would say much more 
concerns in some sense that are still interesting but yeah i agree that just a minority but we be 
should be worrying about this sc no totally right that we can agree on too we used the phrase 
but been talking about the increase of entropy and disorderliness and what we usually say is that defines the 
of time or at least the thermodynamic arrow of time the difference between past and future and as you 
said i think maybe worth sort of elaborating on this idea this fact that entropy is increasing really underlies 
of the interestingness of our lives hard to overemphasize how important this is so things like memory cause and 
free will all ultimately traceable in some sense to the fact that entropy is increasing all around us aa 
can only agree yes sc well you can do more you aa well i can do more i can 
more about that sc well in the following sense i do this myself i say those statements because i 
that true but i think that just as cosmologists focused on why the early universe had a low entropy 
the rest of the world focused enough quite on elaborating how that increase of entropy over time gives rise 
all of these different phenomena aa yeah i agree and i think in some sense everything that happens has 
character to it in that happening is sort of a change in something like something there was one state 
then there was a different one and when if you imagine everything being either in equilibrium or in a 
where the entropy was not changing then a sense in which nothing is really happening in that you can 
run the clock forward and backward and you really distinguish the later thing from the earlier one like everything 
the later one is in the earlier one and vice versa the fact that something new or that something 
there talking about not the fundamental dynamics of the system not the sort of unitary dynamics but talking in 
of a different level of description of the system happening in these coarsegrained or macroscopic or something variables which 
that arena in which the second law is operating and in which you can talk about information changing or 
away or being generated in some sense aa and i think the worlds or actually many worlds like many 
levels of description which are the world that we actually inhabit so anything that we talk about as where 
a level of description that like the wave function of the universe is evolving according to equation any other 
that we describe things talking about it in this more coarsegrained way in which the tendency of that sort 
the relationship between that description of the world and the the wave function description of the world is is 
of central and that is the second law of thermodynamics that like the tension between those two descriptions that 
driving entropy increase is sort of responsible for everything responsible for that there is a future and a past 
are different that you go back in time and just tell what happened in the past that you predict 
future and you remember the past that there are records all of these things that just are our everyday 
existence just are inexorably associated with that second law aa and i think right i too say those words 
appreciating that actually if pressed on how exactly is it that we get records of the past and only 
for the future very very hard to pin down in concrete terms or how is it that we can 
the future and remember the past and not vice versa actually formally carefully specifying those things is enormously subtle 
do and i think that project people think about that but is largely undone in my book sc well 
organization gave me a grant to think about it so i do have a paper coming out that i 
be very interested in aa well done well done sc speaking of which we have this situation that you 
very eloquently where the universe makes sense in the sense that there are laws there are rules not just 
chaos breaking out all the time but there are these looming questions like why does universe exist at all 
does it have a specifically low entropy in the beginning do these features of the universe as we see 
lend credence to the idea that maybe we all just live in a computer simulation not in a naturally 
universe aa not sure why which features would lend credence to us being in a simulation sc well we 
to attribute some psychology to our simulators and maybe just starting from some simple initial conditions and seeing what 
and we end up as part of the backwash aa yeah i guess i see it as a sort 
evidence either way i sc but what do you think of the argument in general let me not be 
specifically provocative in that direction aa well there are a bunch of different things that you might call a 
argument some of which i think are total nonsense and some of which are are only somewhat nonsense but 
very hard to rule out so one species of thing that says given enough technology in one hundred or 
hundred or something years we will be able to run simulations of say what happened in the second half 
the century on earth and historians will be delighted with this because then they can go back and think 
what would have happened if the nazis had won the war and all kinds of interesting counterfactuals and things 
that and so these simulations will be so detailed that have to simulate down to the neuron level of 
beings in them to get the simulations right and so if we assume that the beings in those simulations 
selfaware just like we are then you end up in this situation where there are all these simulations being 
of all these beings and so why we one of those beings in one of those simulations that will 
run in our future aa okay so this is something that is called the simulation argument and was formulated 
this kind of way by nick bostrom profoundly profoundly skeptical of this argument in that i think it will 
out that in order to simulate even a bacterium in a useful sense will turn out to be impossible 
the computational resources of the universe and that the only way to really simulate a bacterium will be to 
a physical system that is like isomorphic to a bacterium sc make a bacterium aa create a bacterium basically 
this will just not be an exciting thing to do like yes if a super civilization you can make 
of versions of earth and see how things played out but you get anything for free be creating lots 
earths and okay so i guess i find that version of the argument not compelling on the other hand 
can sort of ask if the universe if you ask what is the universe really made of and your 
is first like well made of atoms which are made of subatomic particles fine but if you ask what 
those particles then things start to get a little bit more slippery excitations of a quantum field or sort 
things that are pointed to by a wave function what is a quantum field made of well a quantum 
is like made of the ability to create particles it gets very circular and if you ask what is 
wave function a description of where particles will be when you measure them neither of these have a sort 
tangibility to them and they have more like a feeling of an information theoretic thing aa and this leads 
if you think about this a long time you sort of feel like well ultimately the universe maybe is 
sort of informational entity and then you start to think well what does that mean got the information what 
it the floor drops out from under you a little bit when you start to think along those lines 
then if you think the universe is sort of this information thing could it be that that information is 
some larger set a simulation in some super duper computer who knows i think rank speculation after that point 
i think the thing that gets you there to think what is the fundamental constitution of reality i think 
shed a lot of interesting light on that and just much much weirder and kind of disquieting than you 
imagine when so used to thinking of the universe as made of little bits of stuff sc yeah well 
goes back where we started it and the fact that if you do science well it should be a 
discomforting at the end of the day aa indeed sc been you talked about the big picture of the 
universe and where it comes from what that implies and how life can exist in it but also been 
practical in your concerns about the universe you seem to every couple of years start a new organization of 
sort why you share with the listeners like some of the various organizations that had your fingers in the 
of aa yeah so you mentioned one the foundational questions institute and this is an organization that was born 
the desire to have more of the type of fun that been having here getting people together to talk 
the really big questions and also seeing if we can give other people give people money and research funding 
institutional support and so on to do that and been going on since sc let me just mention out 
for the world that it is a wonderful thing precisely because some of these questions are perhaps some of 
most interesting and fun questions you can ask in science but it can be hard to get funding for 
because they can fall between the disciplinary cracks or they seem a little bit too pie in the sky 
the foundational questions institute has done a great job of stepping in and trying to support some of these 
despite that aa yeah yeah thank you and i just agreed for example this incredibly important question of where 
the order in the universe came from it is very difficult to get an nsf grant on that question 
sort of too big and so on so one organization then there was a sort of spinoff of that 
happened i think largely because a certain constituency of people in that organization including max tegmark and myself taking 
longterm view of the universe which you have to do as a cosmologist you sort of realize well we 
have to think about the past twenty years or the next ten or fifteen years we can think on 
scales as cosmologists and physicists what is the world and society going to look like in a thousand years 
a million or a billion aa and once you start thinking about that it kind of reconfigures some of 
questions that you are thinking about like is it really realistic to think that a thousand years from now 
example not going to have built machines smarter than us or not going have been able to change our 
makeup to be something radically different if we want to and so while you can ask are we going 
make machines smarter than us in the next ten years or fifteen years and have lots of debate about 
or twenty or thirty or in a thousand going to do it so just a question of when and 
gets you just thinking about what does that long term future look like then what do we want to 
happen do we want to replace ourselves with machines do we want to have them be around even though 
than us do we want to make ourselves smarter aa so you can think of all these longterm questions 
are kind of science fictiony but also i think based at least some species of science fiction are based 
real science and there are things that you can say about them based on the physics that we do 
and i think one thing that that raft of thinking made clear to us was that we are in 
incredibly vital time in sort of the next fifty years or so in that it seems quite plausible that 
we continue for the next say fifty or one hundred years as we have been technological increase more capability 
to do put in practice a lot of the things that we want to do medically information technology space 
can move out into space a good chance that if we make it through the next one hundred years 
could make it through the next one thousand or a million or a billion if we can get off 
planet if we can get our act together in various ways aa on the other hand a very good 
that we can just kill ourselves off in the next fifty years and this vast vast amount of awesome 
that might otherwise have happened is just going to be curtailed because somebody thought a glint off some clouds 
a nuclear missile and all over right so that would be just sort of an unbelievable tragedy and anything 
you can do to reduce the probability of that sort of tragedy happening is really really high impact if 
look at that big picture and so i think that convinced some of us that if you realize that 
is incredibly high impact and important you might want to do a little bit of it and so sc 
go too far out on a limb there yeah aa yeah well you have to but it is motivating 
we started this new organization called the future of life institute that is concerned with that question essentially given 
existing nuclear or coming very high power transformative technologies in biotech and artificial intelligence and so on what are 
things that we should be thinking about however we can figure it out to increase the probability of things 
well or at least decently and decrease the probability of catastrophe kind of that simple but figuring out what 
those things are and how to do them the rub so what we have been thinking about sc i 
is so how do you do it what does give us an example project or effort that you would 
in the future life institute aa so a lot of effort that put in so far has been on 
intelligence and starting to create a field of research that takes seriously the idea that artificial intelligence could possibly 
a downside as well as an upside and that if we really take seriously the idea that ai could 
in its goal of making things that are broadly intelligent in the human sort of sense or more then 
opens up a rather large can of worms what does the world actually look like what does a scenario 
which there are lots of entities that are more capable intellectually than people look like and is that can 
imagine a world in which that is the case and where happy and what does that world look like 
we and then better rethink some things if trying to accomplish something where we imagine it turning out well 
so i sort of a long a vague question but there are a lot of very specific research questions 
machine learning and ai and adjoining fields where you can ask what does it mean to make a machine 
or ai system that is robust what does it mean to make one that will continue to do the 
that we want it to do and rather than following say what we tell it to do but in 
that we are very unhappy with how it actually accomplishes those things so this is a very long conversation 
sure aa funding actual scientific technical research on how to do artificial intelligence safely is one of the crucial 
that i think been working on sc how would you just personally rank the risk of ai alongside such 
as a nuclear war or a global climate catastrophe as things we should be worrying about aa it depends 
what sort of worries so i think climate change is obviously happening and going to happen is going to 
a catastrophe at some level almost certainly in my view so obviously worth worrying about at the same time 
think climate change is going to be as catastrophic as a nuclear war would be if we had one 
think fairly clear but is very high probability a nuclear war is just disquietingly highly probable whilst still being 
low a percent or something per year which is terrifying but learned to live with somehow aa ai i 
is different in the sense that i attribute quite low probability to there being a breakthrough in ai next 
and suddenly a selfaware computer takes over the world and kills us all like in the terminator this is 
sort of sensationalistic and not worth putting a lot of thought into but at the same time if it 
that we have a massive investment in artificial intelligence now a thousand or so really really excellent scientists working 
google deep mind explicitly working on developing artificial general intelligence this is just many many many many many more 
smart people that were doing it ten years ago sc yeah aa and i want to bet against the 
efforts of many many many really smart people for decades so i think that has convinced me that not 
to be hundreds of years most likely that the probability distribution is in the decades and not in the 
longterm future and that i so the probability that necessarily mean a catastrophe but i think it does mean 
sort of phase change for civilization when we succeed in bringing something into being that is as capable as 
and as general as us and replicatable and all those things no way that things are just going to 
business as usual sc yeah aa and i think just better be thinking pretty hard about that it may 
be that far away sc well okay good given us things to think about both on the cosmic scale 
then in the more nearterm scale why you play us out with another koan from your book is there 
particular good one that would serve as an epilogue for the conversation aa see yeah yeah let me do 
one this is sc good to have a sacred text you can read from for any sermon when asked 
okay so these are a couple of characters that have been introduced earlier in the book that are historical 
yagyu munanori and takian zoho were swordsmen in early century japan and sitting at a game of go when 
enter they ignore you as you watch them you grow increasingly uneasy as you realize they are breaking the 
or at least not playing go during a momentary lapse in the focus you ask is this game that 
for you to replies zoho you almost think you see munanori smile which always signals danger the game wears 
each move taking longer than the last try as you might just when you think you understand the rules 
played stone proves you wrong at last zoho concedes have no munanori nods a bow after a time zoho 
i would like to hear the rules that you played in the surprised know the munanori turns toward you 
the rules in advance so is the sc this makes me want to say things but i think be 
appropriate if we just called it there and let ourselves contemplate what that all means alright anthony aguirre thanks 
much for being on the mindscape podcast aa thanks for having me it was tremendous fun sc alright take 
byebye aa bye music aa tried to disprove the cosmological constant observations and sc concluded there was no vacuum 
albeit circa but i am still shocked and appalled nevertheless how far do fields extend into the distance universe 
how fast inquiring minds want to know toward the end aguirre said change is going to be a catastrophe 
some level almost interesting how scientists in one area usually understand science in another almost no climate scientist is 
anything close to climate catastrophe aguirre then adds that the chance of nuclear war a percent or so per 
which is but who came up with that yearly probability just something people sometimes say about nuclear war with 
obvious reasoning behind it entropy is increasing and the universe is expanding at an increasing rate seems as if 
energy gives rise to entropy or vice versa perception is relative the gist of theories of relativity when mind 
closed out in pessimism the perception of an end looms closer than does one that brims with optimism perhaps 
change in climate is being brought about by mother nature on earth and we are but in the hiatus 
two ice ages another excellent thought provoking podcast thanks once again sean at around professor aguirre talks about the 
containing a lot more information than a statistical model of it number of planets around a star etc is 
really anything paradoxical about this and does it really give us any insight as to the reasons for early 
entropy yes first of all thank you now i can properly pronounce aguirre second yes finally someone who likewise 
with simulation argument i also appreciate as a machine learning specialist aguirre drawing a line between ai as we 
it today and agi in the future done with cosmological koans which i picked up in part due to 
appearing somewhere on the cover and having a fun time with it great work sirs simply here to say 
an excellent podcast this episode was i thoroughly enjoyed it excellent audio quality on this one too really happy 
see how well this podcast has evolved thank you sean excellent podcast really enjoyed this one excelente podcast sean
