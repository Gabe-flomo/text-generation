transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll those of you who 
game of thrones fans and you remember the finale earlier this year mostly not a success in my eyes 
those of some others but there were some good moments in there a quote i remember from tyrion when 
says nothing in the world more powerful than a good sc you hear quotes like that quite often in 
and it may be a little selfserving since these are words written by storytellers who are basically telling us 
the mouths of their characters there are no people more powerful in the world than us but still sympathetic 
the quote there are individual people who do things people who have more power instruments of power whether technological 
otherwise but these are often motivated by the stories people are telling themselves and each other about why here 
acting in certain ways sc and a wonderful person to comment on the role of stories in our culture 
our world is guest stephen greenblatt the john cogan university professor of humanities at harvard and a very wellknown 
scholar and literary historian one of the founders probably the main driving force between the new historicism school of 
criticism that takes both the literary text and also its context and the historical resonances all together as part 
the analysis of that text sc so shakespeare has been stephen main focus of research over the years but 
won the pulitzer prize and the national book award for a book on lucretius the book is called the 
how the world became modern and lucretius of course is one of my favorite ancient poets author of de 
natura on the nature of things which tells a cosmological story for ancient atomists who want to just give 
all the credit for everything and greenblatt has also written about adam and eve the origin story of the 
and hebrew bibles so this is a wonderful opportunity to talk about how we think about the world which 
something we do on mindscape every week but in the context of the stories that we tell about the 
which is what doing all the time whether we know it or not so go music sc stephen greenblatt 
to the mindscape podcast stephen greenblatt thanks pleasure to be here sc we usually have shakespeare scholars on the 
but written a book about the book of genesis about adam and eve in that story and also a 
about lucretius who wrote this wonderful poem about the universe back in ancient times so i begin to get 
feeling that maybe secretly desiring to be a cosmologist not just a literary scholar sg oh well not a 
but i am interested in the origins of things the origins of the world that we live in of 
ideas that we have and particularly interested in the role that the human imagination has played in fashioning a 
for ourselves sc yeah and i think since the audience is probably not used to topics like this why 
just start with the very biggest picture and when at cocktail parties or stuck in airplanes and people say 
to me what you do how do you explain the role of a literary scholar sg i i not 
cocktail parties that often people invite me to explain what i do very often but i suppose if they 
i say a writer and a literary historian i sometimes say a shakespearian since that covers a lot of 
but not as you say all the ground sg and if you ask what a literary scholar does in 
to try to immerse themselves in and their students in this astonishing thing that survived that continues to survive 
human beings which is that we over a long period of time actually from the beginning as a species 
tried to register and leave traces of our experience which is an odd thing to do other animals in 
do that sg so already years before the present people drew things on the walls of caves and recorded 
they thought or dreamt they thought around them and they also signed those objects as you may know by 
their hands up against the walls of caves and blowing pigment around them so you see these hand prints 
ever been fortunate enough to go to those astonishing caves sc i did not know that no sg so 
the little thing that says picasso or rembrandt is a very old idea and in addition again if gonna 
there since starting to talk about origins and cosmology i suppose in those same caves archeologists have found flutes 
out of bear bone so that obviously the creation of music goes back basically to the beginnings of what 
means to be homo sapiens so we have art we have music and then in the oldest of the 
the oldest of the surviving ones that we know in france there from the very beginning in that case 
figure very few human figures but in that instances a figure that is the legs of a woman and 
the head of a bull and if who knows what that means but if among other things what it 
to mean is is that something that we would call mythmaking or storytelling also goes back to the beginnings 
fiction yeah sg homo sapiens that old as a species so this is the these are among the earliest 
that we have of our species life so we have art and music and storytelling and to be a 
critic or to be interested in any case in the humanities or the arts is to be interested in 
fundamental series of things that we do as a species sc and interesting you went to ancient history right 
i mean sort of your angle here has been what has been called new historicism or i guess called 
poetics i even want to try to define it but maybe you can put it into words bringing together 
history and context of things with the texts themselves sg so the first thing to say sean is that 
new historicism or cultural poetics is the first thing to say is that the reason i go back to 
beginning is that the humanities unlike say neuroscience or geology or medical treatments no charting of a history of 
and very strange we have to take in how strange that is if i go to a doctor i 
want to be treated with therapies that were current in one thousand nine hundred eighty and i certainly want 
treated with the therapies that were current in so that we actually sometimes deceived or sometimes disappointed but we 
that there is some kind of history of progress but in the case of the arts if you go 
the caves at lascaux you absolutely you say that those paintings are better than bruegel or rembrandt but you 
would be very hardpressed to say worse sc yeah they can hang with our present day artists sg and 
weird think how weird that is and so the first thing to say putting whatever approach you have aside 
that there is no clear history of progress there are individual little histories there are progressions within technologies representational 
but no history of progress and i think we have to let that especially in our current culture we 
to actually take in how odd that is and one of the things that it means is that we 
be in strangely intense and direct contact with people who lived a very long time ago in circumstances and 
that we can barely understand and cultures that we have almost no other access to sg i say it 
way because it puts the project of historicism putting new historicism aside it puts the project of historicism in 
peculiar light you could say that historicism traditionally the historical study of the humanities has tried to recreate and 
and explore the cultural historical social circumstances that led to the production of the works of art that we 
about and i think important in so far as you can do it but a you always do it 
b so what what if you do it you have to start in my view with the other thing 
talked about the astonishment that we can still be in touch with this without actually almost any contextual understanding 
sg as if we found a random yellowed letter in a desk in a in a hotel in a 
that never been in before and we opened the letter and addressed to us by someone been dead for 
of years so take that in and start there the trouble with old historicism is that it tended to 
that fact i think that weird fact about our encounter with the ghosts of the past however the other 
of this encounter is that we can even if we think about moving us or reaching us from the 
of culture of the past to take one of those caves for example where we have almost no understanding 
what that culture was like or only the most rudimentary and primitive understanding we actually know something about ourselves 
we can think a little bit about why responding so powerfully to the thing so what speaking to in 
hence the new in new historicism that that we start to think about the historical circumstances or the social 
cultural circumstances in so far as we can understand them in the past but only in relation to what 
in the here and now to the questions that asking to who we are sg i say that because 
the historical work in the world done by people like me and people much smarter than me trying to 
what shakespeare or homer or joyce or anyone was about that produced these astonishing works that kind of historical 
can never answer magically the power of those works the works reach you independent as it were of the 
understanding but it remains fascinating to try to grapple with the meanings of the past with how these works 
produced and above all how works that were not produced in our world still address us sc well interesting 
what you seem to be emphasizing there is the ahistoricity of some of these texts in the sense that 
is a universal aspect to them to the good ones anyway sg well at the very least i would 
with saying yes the funny thing about the new in new historicism is that it also is a slightly 
against the idea that used to be carried when you said look you understand anything unless you go back 
the past and understand what the circumstances are i mean very sympathetic to that account but i think that 
has great limits and the other side of what saying is that there is a history that we do 
access to and our history and that to be aware of our history and to bring it to bear 
whatever historical traces encountering seems to me part of the project sg i pulled down a book when we 
getting ready for this interview because i thought this question would come up and i wanted to suggest how 
works so a very long time ago i published a book called renaissance selffashioning and even before then i 
written the particular passage looking at about contemporary christopher marlowe and about the strange violent and disturbing imagination of 
and the works that he produced in the for his late for his contemporaries but in the beginning of 
chapter in this old book of mine called renaissance selffashioning i begin the following way june a small fleet 
by the earl of cumberland set out from gravesend for the south seas it sailed down the west african 
sighting sierra leone in october and at this point we may let one of those on board the merchant 
sarracoll tell his own and what follows is a quotation which read sg fourth of november we went on 
to a town of the negroes which we found to be but lately lately recently built was of about 
hundred houses and walled about with mighty great trees and stakes so thick that a rat could hardly get 
or out but as it chanced we came directly upon a port which was not shut up where we 
with such fierceness that the people fled all out of the town which we found to be finely built 
their fashion and the streets of it so intricate that it was difficult for us to find the way 
that we came in at we found their houses and streets so finely and cleanly kept that it was 
admiration to us all for that neither in the houses nor streets was so much dust to be found 
would fill an egg shell we found little in their houses except some mats gourds and some earthen pots 
men at their departure set the town on fire and it was burned for the most part of it 
a quarter of an hour the houses being covered with reed and sg okay the passage and i go 
to talk about plays and about the strange current of violence in in work the peculiar blend of almost 
admiration and violence and so on and so on and way of opening up plays like tamburlaine and dr 
and so forth but the reason i read the passage is that probably not for you and probably not 
most of your listeners but for me and for my generation that passage which comes from the past had 
very specific resonance when this was published in and when i wrote the essay back in the and the 
has to do with a scene that had burned its way into our consciousness which was shown on television 
i think when morley safer was then a young reporter recently died after a distinguished career as a reporter 
in vietnam and showed a famous clip was only a few minutes or less of a gi setting fire 
a vietnamese village with their straw roofs with his zippo lighter a famous scene a kind of meaningless a 
act of violence against people who were noncombatants sg so new historicism my work and the work to some 
of others in my generation had to do yes with excavating the past but excavating the past is never 
neutral activity it has something to do with what interested in who we are so why this passage from 
sarracoll out of if you actually look i have it in this office where having this conversation but if 
look at voyages volume after volume huge bodies of this and i was particularly at this point of my 
a mad reader of those things just a kind of crazy grazer into the past that way and i 
trusted my unconscious if what it was when i would read and read i would suddenly think stop what 
this why is this reaching me from this enormous body of things that traces that survive from the sg 
that passage from sarracoll is a perfect example where just out of the enormous randomness i particularly interested in 
leone or the earl of cumberland or this virtually anonymous merchant but suddenly something leapt off the page for 
and i asked myself is it leaping off the page for and it was both because it spoke to 
present and because it seemed to be a key that unlocked a door in christopher work sc not stuck 
in the past we recently just had columbus day a few weeks ago and an ongoing argument about how 
think about that part of the past sg yes i was flabbergasted by the way i know if you 
is another piece of historicism of a curious kind i know this before but i know about the origins 
columbus day so one it was meant as a onetime event by the president benjamin harrison sg i know 
sc who instituted it in the wake of the lynching in new orleans of eleven southern italians who had 
exonerated in a trial accused of some nefarious crime or other and then a crowd caught them and lynched 
and the lynching was actually in this article about it was weirdly approved of even by northern newspapers like 
new york times why because southern italians at that point particularly southern italians were perceived as black and were 
the way in the mass murder mode of american racism the way blacks were treated so columbus day originated 
you think of it from that perspective as an attempt to make italians white certain italians white at the 
of course or you could say at the expense of blacks i mean of africanamericans i mean to try 
create the boundary around those whom it was okay to lynch can you imagine i never knew that sc 
no yeah sg i was quite astonished by this there was an article in the new york times that 
around columbus day sc it speaks to the usefulness of remembering some of that history i guess you point 
the idea that we understand texts in the past unless we dive into their history probably wrong probably too 
but then the other idea that these texts are just supposed to be understood as works of art in 
pure realm of aesthetic beauty and if i remember correctly you probably remember this better than i do but 
the and your name was invoked in the culture wars right when people were talking about the tempest and 
or not we should think of it as telling us something about colonialism somehow and there were people who 
like no no not how we should be thinking about sg yeah i had a brief moment of notoriety 
of george will who actually is sort of a interesting figure i mean often quite i think thoughtful wrote 
that said that people who like me who said that the tempest was actually about colonialism were more dangerous 
saddam hussein that was a very implausible thing to say but this was all the passions of the moment 
two quick things about the work of art as pure beauty of course not true sc right sg i 
works of art are embedded in particular moments like everything is embedded i mean take place and make statements 
have influences on the other hand the idea that works of art matter or that works of pure beauty 
that they have no relation to society has served art well in various circumstances for example in repressive regimes 
have allowed works of art to say things that would be punished elsewhere so the idea that works of 
are not engaged in political or social work but are purely about beauty is itself an historical or sc 
political sg and political phenomenon with an enormous importance at various moments in the english authorities under james i 
and decided to kill a welsh catholic a benedictine named i think his last name was roberts john roberts 
who was very popular worked with the poor and had a kind of a charismatic following and the state 
its general hostility to catholics which extended through the late and early century decided to kill this guy and 
they had the execution they did the usual unspeakable things and then they took his heart the executioner took 
heart out of his chest held it up before the crowd and said is the heart of a traitor 
live the and the crowd was completely silent sg so we know about this because this was the silence 
surprising and upsetting from the point of view of the authorities the authorities expected the crowd would shout save 
so if you said anything other than god save the king you could be in tremendous trouble in a 
of that kind and the authorities of the time watched very carefully how the crowd was responding in events 
this kind same year the tale tale is performed before people in an afternoon in the theater in london 
and the character the tyrannical king says to a woman character named paulina enraged him have you and she 
a heretic that makes the fire not she which burns in now if someone said anything of the kind 
that execution a heretic making the fire a heretic executing the man this guy is not a this victim 
someone said that at the scene of the execution or if someone said that in the tavern they would 
their ears cut off their tongue cut out or be killed but a character could say this before people 
an afternoon and neither the actor nor the playwright nor the company got in trouble for it why because 
work of art i mean it mean anything it have any political life i mean what i think what 
try to make people understand which is that saying these that works of art are pure aesthetic experiences and 
nothing to do with other aspects of life is itself a political statement that serves a particular purpose including 
aesthetic purpose that allowed these things to go on and it in that sense i want the walls to 
away i want all of this to be us just a wink and understand that not true but i 
us to know that this is how it works and true sc yeah and it goes both ways right 
something about the culture and what was going on helps us understand the works and reading the works can 
us understand the present moment your most i think your most recent book is tyrant is that right sg 
sc and this is about all the different ways that shakespeare talks about bad rulers taking over and did 
learn anything by studying that particular angle in shakespeare sg i did i actually felt i learned quite a 
and as often happens you learn in the writing you learn in the doing after all the basic principle 
teaching is a gratifying act you know what you think and one says to students and i feel for 
you know what you think before you actually sit down and try to think it and write it and 
in the course of writing that book and thinking about the trajectory of thinking about politics i learned both 
how he thought catastrophic leaders could arise and i learned about how he thought it might be possible under 
circumstances and he tried experimentally as it were different scenarios for thinking how to get rid of a disaster 
this kind short of civil war since most often the way these things is through civil war and shakespeare 
this to be a as we all understand this to be a catastrophe but how else do you get 
of such a disaster visited upon first of all interested in why would sane people who are selfinterested a 
that actually after all wants to function more or less peacefully and prosperously why would they allow themselves to 
into the hands of a catastrophic leader and then of course why when they get in to it how 
they get out of it sc yeah what is it about shakespeare that makes him especially good at this 
some way been many plays written many books written about terrible rulers about any other topic but he does 
to have something interesting to say about just about everything sg he does i have a magical i wish 
did have a formula to explain this i have the usual evasions of an answer he was a genius 
was an unbelievable genius super bright i mean that he thought about everything he had an unbelievable imagination but 
is just a way of saying sc right sg i mean i know how how did mozart do what 
did how did bach did what he did i mean how did jane austen do what she did people 
huge species with a lot of people in the population every once in a while someone pops up just 
i mean so as i say a dumb explanation but i have a smarter one i could say several 
things he came along by the accident of his birth at a moment at which his language was exploding 
possibilities and power he came along by the accident of his birth at a moment in which there was 
new medium that had not been whose resources had not been exploited so like the first generation that or 
first generations that figure out how to make movies or how to make longform television series i mean shortly 
you start making longform television series someone makes the wire you think how did that sc perfect already yes 
yeah fantastic but it has to do with the medium being new and available as it were for experiments 
a tremendous oppressive past so a second explanation we could say that it helped in a somewhat perverse way 
he came along at a time in which this censorship and he has to be thoughtful careful and cunning 
a little clever sg about how he wants to how he in his culture wants to talk about things 
are not possible to talk about openly sc do you think that he was very often trying to make 
political observations but in a sneaky way sg i do sc yeah sg i do i think quite often 
think and not just trenchant political observations but trenchant observations about what be spoken in other ways what can 
say about samesex love that you say openly in the late century what can you say about perverse family 
what can you say about disobedience what can you say about transgression as well as of course more directly 
a obeyed in office shakespeare has a character step up and say you said that in the wrong place 
got in tremendous trouble sc right sg in the late and early century sc you mentioned that no history 
progress in the creation of these kinds of art but there are changes of style and so forth do 
see if you teach shakespeare your students respond to it differently now than they would have decades ago sg 
and i should quickly say there may not be a history of progress but there are some artists who 
greater than other artists the premise of what saying i mean so there are astonishing things that happened just 
you want to say that shakespeare i think not interesting to my i think to say that shakespeare is 
greater dramatist than sophocles or what does that mean that these are both great dramatists but it mean that 
is not better than the person who wrote crack me this nut or tons of miserable plays that survive 
the late early century so we know there were bad people at their game as well as good people 
and now lost the train of your question sc how do students respond to it over time sg oh 
students are the same as us as it were in that they depending on going on in their lives 
in their world some things reach them more powerfully than other things so certainly the case now that if 
teach othello or i teach hamlet the race issues or the gender issues are registered in a different way 
than they would have been when i was a student certain things can be spoken no one said when 
was when i read hamlet for the first time what what happened to ophelia why was she treated this 
we think of this as tragedy or that what does it mean to block that out and so but 
it rushes in so and likewise with lots of these plays very good at writing very uncomfortable plays sc 
once saw this bbc televised production of shakespeare where othello was played by a white guy and there was 
long intro sort of excusing andor apologizing for it and so am i correct in thinking that was just 
crazy thing to do chuckle sg crazy thing to do it by a white guy or a crazy thing 
they made the case sg or apologize for it sc as far as we know othello could easily have 
white that sounds very wrong to me sg well several different things not sure not having seen this not 
what they were up to the play was always long long performed actually i think the first time was 
the century when it it was performed by white actors in various forms of black face or darker face 
certainly true that the play was written for richard burbage a white actor and it was performed by white 
all the way through until ira aldridge sc no they were trying to really make the case that all 
language of the moors and so forth could just have been southern europeans sg well it certainly was the 
that in the century particularly in america when the idea that a white woman could fall in love with 
black man one way of was disgusting and outrageous from the point of view of the racial codes of 
whites one way of arguing about the play to justify the play was to say he really a black 
in the sense of a subsaharan black man he was a moor slightly or whatever so maybe what they 
up to sc yeah that was the impression i got too sg yeah not crazy it just happens to 
racist chuckle as an argument or or i dont know i accuse the people who did an uncomfortable disturbing 
to claim depending on what the nature of the claim was because as i say it has an ugly 
of being invoked as a way of justifying what was otherwise to the racist audience unjustifiable sc do you 
a particular way of thinking about the plays of that we now cringe at a little bit the taming 
the shrew or the merchant of venice where the sexism or antisemitism seems to us to be a little 
different maybe than it would have been at the time there are people who say really not antisemitic or 
other people who say this is an illustration we should look at it sg i think this is an 
issue and certainly an important issue now because of the nature of heightened awareness and sensitivity especially in universities 
i think it always is an important issue for historical reasons both in the past but certainly for ourselves 
merchant of venice postholocaust is not the merchant of venice before the holocaust and that mean irrelevant the holocaust 
irrelevant it means as i started to say this is our experience how can you watch this play without 
a little bit about what happened in the and you and not only because importing a completely irrelevant thing 
what happened in the and is not completely unrelated to what was already expressed in the late century which 
the use of the figure of the jew as the mortal enemy of the christians you tell that story 
and powerfully enough nasty things happen sg and so i mean that shakespeare is responsible for the holocaust i 
mean that it is not but i think that the tropes of antisemitism that the play actually explores in 
rather profound way but not in a clean way are very much involved in the way in which the 
as we could say the we started by talking about adam and eve the way eve is represented in 
is not innocent in the longterm treatment of women not the whole story not responsible solely for that but 
innocent the cultures are not innocent the greatest artists are not innocent they reflect the values of their world 
their time they think about them the great ones that we care about shakespeare is a perfect example shakespeare 
not an enlightenment artist not writing to try to make people who live in people like myself feel great 
every one of their opinions being validated living in a different world sg the taming of the shrew is 
very disturbingly misogynistic play the merchant of venice is a disturbingly antisemitic play i have no desire to whitewash 
and say no not not at but on the other hand because a great artist he actually manages to 
and to unsettle the very things that he seems to be also exploiting sc something worth appreciating about it 
worth understanding and sg yeah appreciating entering into trying to understand how else do we enter into them how 
do we understand this world which continues in the case of misogyny and antisemitism to have a contemporary life 
do we get back how do we ever enter into this consciousness if it happens that not ours how 
we ever take some critical distance toward it but simply denouncing it and saying get rid of imagines that 
rid of it will just simply eliminate the phenomenon in itself it sc yeah and adam and eve is 
very special case because other than shakespeare the bible is probably in the english language the most influential work 
literature those are probably the top two and like you said adam and eve as a story influence not 
how we treated and think about women but many other things sg nature for example we should be the 
species which is what it seems to say at the beginning of adam and eve but is that a 
way of thinking about what we are in relation to the rest of the natural world that we are 
the top banana well it happens it was accurate we this was after all the text written when humans 
responsible for the great dieoff and so forth but we would become that and that text is not innocent 
our becoming it on the other hand it produce that i mean it make us but it helps to 
us what we became sc or at least it comes from a common source right sg yeah exactly sc 
that makes us and something that makes adam and eve sg exactly and we could then because written in 
form as is indeed the transgression that begins with eating of the fruit it enables us to start thinking 
where we come from who we are we started this conversation by talking about my interest in origins and 
think that literature not only super old literature like the book of genesis but all literature enables us to 
down into the places that we come from and to look at them in a way that we ordinary 
at them we just we normally think that way about ourselves represent ourselves as doing things unless very neurotic 
in your book about adam and eve you go through a lot of how it was interpreted over the 
but tell us a little bit probably many people are not familiar with how the story was written or 
original way in which those first couple of chapters of genesis came to be sg we know of course 
sure we the story certainly preceded the first time it was written down it was probably written down in 
wake of the return from exile in babylon in i would have to now remind myself of what the 
was when they returned under cyrus from their exile but the story must have originated long before that almost 
as an oral tale it has the form of an oral tale so that it someone who sat down 
a pen in hand and wrote the thing down but probably a story that had been endlessly told and 
in various forms sc is it safe to think that most fiction that was written down i say fiction 
stories that were written down at that time did start orally and then got written down or were there 
did such a thing exist sg i mean something not novelists but some things certainly once writing cuneiform was 
what about three thousand five hundred bc i think these we know for sure sc we fact check worry 
no but we know for sure in any case when someone had the idea but in uruk in mesopotamia 
someone has the idea of actually writing things down orders for beer shipments sc some things change sg yeah 
mean i say that semiseriously because one of the first things that we actually have in cuneiform are beer 
anyway it takes place because there are now large numbers of people living together uruk was the first city 
the world first megacity and that meant you were encountering people you know personally in your community so it 
to spur the idea of actually getting things somehow recorded somehow or other the incas do it with those 
knots but people in mesopotamia did it with these little marks in clay and certainly up to that point 
sure the one thing we can be absolutely sure of is that the stories that existed existed because they 
in circulation orally then at that point in that part of the world and at that point a somewhat 
moment in which things get written down in first in phoenician and then in greek the first stories that 
have are almost certainly the stories that are circulated orally so the iliad and the odyssey are oral tales 
written down in the first earliest moment the thing we talked about with shakespeare in the theater the moment 
which a new technology sg and often interesting again to return to something we were talking about before that 
of incandescent moment of a new technology precipitates remarkable works so gilgamesh in mesopotamian culture then the iliad and 
could say then the bible interesting about all of those three documents we of course know the relationship of 
documentary traces of that and the oral tale we know from various forms of analysis that an overwhelming likelihood 
these are oral tales before written down but how much changed when they were written down to take your 
question how much happened when the person make his name up some people thought it was the prophet ezra 
wrote down the bible very unlikely or to take what religious people believe moses wrote it down or when 
or whatever his name was from mesopotamia wrote it down or whoever we mean when we say homer how 
was actually value added by the writer who wrote it down we know an interesting relation we can hypothesize 
between the remarkable people and remarkable geniuses who actually recorded the thing and the stories that were circulating sg 
the case of the bible trickier or at least we can feel the trickiness more manifestly because it is 
unless you are a pious believer in divine inspiration reasonably clear to virtually all scholars that there are multiple 
that are being stitched together and actually what we think of homer as well that homer was what was 
called a stitcher of songs someone who stitched these things together and an example for that in genesis is 
fact that there are two different accounts of the creation of humans one that involves a separate creation of 
male and a female and one that seems to involve the creation of the two together male and female 
and heard the claim made that in near eastern literature at the time the idea of a text being 
contradictory to itself was no big deal that was just how we talked it always seemed weird to me 
the two stories were naively at odds sg yes well people of course for a very long time think 
was naive at all they thought it was a mystery that needed explanation because intellectuals are good at this 
have been good at it for thousands of years there are lots of interesting explanations for what appears to 
a tension between the two different accounts if you believe that the work was dictated by an angel or 
the holy ghost to moses then you have to and you think inerrant it possibly have a mistake then 
say naive or contradictory you say that it needs explanation it needs interpretation and people like me come along 
say oh now i have an interesting account of how it worked sc the first yes sg exactly sc 
unlike homer say or i know enough about gilgamesh but there was this sort of political cultural context the 
were a small people surrounded by bigger peoples sg yes sc and the bible had this political didactic purpose 
in mind sort of setting an agenda of who we were and where we came from sg yes we 
created not by marduk we were created by yahweh and marduk is nothing marduk is an empty wind or 
is the demon but yahweh is the sole creator of the universe so already as it now the bible 
marduk feh yahweh yes but the bible very clearly says that in the beginning god yahweh created the heavens 
the earth and a polemical statement it means that the other competing gods who claimed to be doing who 
to have done abzu as they say marduk was the creator of humans or whomever tiamat and so forth 
the creators this are done by people who springing up like mushrooms out of nowhere they are aware of 
world that living in which there are competing claims sc yeah and is it amazing to you that despite 
of these sort of reasons why these texts were written they managed to come up with one of the 
stories or tell a story that has resonance for us down through many centuries sg simultaneously amazing and inevitable 
me sean amazing because these stories are so powerful and they still reach us and in this case the 
of adam and eve in the garden with the magical trees and the talking snake is a story that 
knows thousands of years later even though a wildly implausible story of human origins as most stories of human 
are nonetheless a a gazillion people still believe it and b even if you believe it a little new 
cartoon that shows two naked people in the garden with a tree everyone sc what that means sg remarkable 
because how human beings in culture produce and transmit their deepest ideas why in the business that in because 
idea that this is mere decoration flowers on the table is the naive idea that these stories storytelling imagemaking 
is what is at the very heart of what it is to be a human being and to produce 
generation after generation to transmit it sc but even when i was a kid going to sunday school the 
that the really bad thing was eating fruit from the tree of knowledge rubbed me the wrong way like 
i quite know what message i was supposed to be getting from that sg yes it rubbed people the 
way two thousand years ago you were you just being impious you were responding to the story because the 
of the story stories are if powerful disturbing and that and mystifying and troubling that was in a much 
modern way as i wrote elsewhere that was if you study shakespeare in relation to his sources what you 
is that shakespeare finds a powerful story he identifies what the motive or the explanatory principle of the story 
and he throws it away and then he starts to work so he does that again and again sc 
an example of that sg well an example of that would be hamlet in source source for hamlet little 
is killed when a little boy in scandinavian culture where expected that a son the murder takes place in 
and is known expected in this culture that a son will have to avenge his father if the been 
if the murderer is known sg but hamlet is a little kid so the question is how is he 
to survive till old enough to kill the person who killed his father and the answer is that he 
insane yeah drools shits on himself or whatever everyone in the court thinks that little hamlet is mentally deficient 
sort of funny at that and so they keep him around as a kind of harmless mascot and he 
able to keep that going until he grows up to be big enough to actually kill his killer shakespeare 
the basic plot but he has hamlet be a late adolescent or a young man perfectly capable of taking 
when the ghost of his father comes and tells him happened and then hamlet pretends to he says gonna 
an antic he says going to pretend that why pretend that it actually is the worst possible thing to 
because it calls attention to yourself sg and then it becomes the beginning of a like the irritating grain 
sand in an oyster that begins to produce this extraordinary pearl and you start worrying about why everyone starts 
in the play why is he laughter and then we start worrying as an audience why is he behaving 
way and i can show you this again and again in king lear in othello this is how shakespeare 
and so to go back to the problem of eating from why would you ever tell someone not to 
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and particularly why would that be the principal prohibition 
if you know the difference been good and evil how would you know whether to obey the prohibition laughter 
so all i can say is that two thousand years ago they dug in the they dug up some 
that were buried in the sand in egypt by a socalled gnostic group a group that was trying to 
the mysteries of the faith and the gnostic group thinks that the hero of that story must be the 
or the woman one or the other because actually of course knowledge is the thing that we must have 
that the god a god who tells you not to know must be a wicked god sc but then 
sects that had that claim got stamped out they lost sg they got stamped out yes they lost and 
the stuff was buried for several thousand years laughter sc lucretius is a very different origin story in many 
but some similarities right in adam and eve we get kicked out of the garden of eden in lucretius 
atomist a naturalist i think safe to say in the sense that not a theist so a worry in 
or for the readers of lucretius that disenchanting that it takes away some of the romance of the world 
is your feeling about how people responded to the poem i love lucretius and i write about it in 
my books but maybe we should tell the audience what his poem is sg well he was a lucretius 
a poet and philosopher follower of the greek philosopher epicurus and the atomist tradition that epicurus himself represented but 
is writing around fifty bce and he writes a long latin poem a remarkably powerful and beautiful poem and 
survival of that poem is itself important and surprising because most of the texts by epicurus by democritus by 
by the whole greek atomist tradition disappeared and very few things survive sc literally some aphorisms sg some aphorisms 
accounts of piece of a letter accounts of what his philosophy was in a historian an ancient historian of 
who recorded some of these things but most of the work is gone some more recently have been discovered 
the new technology able to read not by epicurus but some by followers of epicurus able to read the 
the scrolls found in the ruins of pompeii sc how many years between epicurus and lucretius sg oh centuries 
yeah sg yeah so because this very full remarkably full poem survives that we know in a rich way 
the theory is and the theory is that we begin in a magical garden that was made just for 
and we could eat anything we wanted and life was beautiful until we fucked up but that we began 
accident not all about us we by god meant to be the dominant creatures and we disobey a commandment 
began the way everything begins in a set of mutations he have said genetic mutations atomic mutations strange things 
fluctuations and random events sg yeah fluctuations and random events and certainly the case that we as a species 
the way all organic species begin in a ferocious struggle for existence and reproduction and if somehow the mutation 
whatever thing that emerged to be able to find food and reproduce then that species had a chance to 
going it go forever not destined to go forever no species goes forever because something the circumstances change the 
changes we our society will screw up in various ways and something else will come along that will be 
successful at getting the available food and reproducing and filling the world but we for a while have though 
certainly began and have emerged only in a very long difficult process of as they say random but beginning 
a kind of set of purely random events sc yeah i once wrote a little article calling him the 
quantum cosmologist sg yeah good sc because he did have this view of the world and the fluctuations the 
was an important part of it but also the uncompromising look at the implications of this such as our 
will end and also our individual lives will end we will not go to the afterlife and be happy 
sg no no no afterlife because the soul is made up out of atoms just as the body is 
up out of atoms this is lucretius thought the soul was made up out of particularly fine atoms but 
reasonably good hypothesis the way we think our consciousness is made up out of very in a way very 
neural transmissions and once gone though all go the way everything goes so that the idea that gonna now 
thought this was good news because you have to worry that you were gonna be pushing a rock up 
hill chuckle in hades and that would then roll down as soon as you get it up to the 
of the hill so he thought that the point about this is that you have to be afraid of 
anymore that the fear of death or the fear of fmo as sometimes called fear of missing out miss 
children and so were that this was absurd not gonna miss anything because you be all be over sc 
he represented this as part of his therapy the this work of philosophy was meant as a kind of 
to make you feel freed from the anxieties and obsessions that most human beings spent their lives in the 
of but it found to be all that effective as a therapy chuckle and it been just as in 
whole world what science has offered us has been at the very least a mixed message therapeutically of course 
managed to extend our life spans extraordinarily as a result of science but the deep questions the anxieties and 
only have to look around in our political world to understand that the anxieties and obsessions that have driven 
for thousands of years are present live and kicking now sc absolutely sg so already when when cicero for 
contemplated this message from lucretian epicureanism that when dead dead nothing will continue afterwards not gonna have an afterlife 
says in fact the good news laughter sc and that is vividly contemporary right still having this debate right 
sg absolutely sc i absolutely have this debate with people and you have a thesis that when the poem 
rediscovered it had a profound effect on european intellectual thought sg eventually i claim that it was a overnight 
on the contrary it seemed not even so much impious though eventually it seemed impious but at first just 
interesting for grammar interesting for its metaphors interesting for its imagery and so on and so on but in 
far as it was a theory it seemed crazy crazy cosmological theory sc this is was rediscovered century sg 
was discovered yes in the early century so it seemed in a world that believed precisely that we were 
favored creatures of a providential god this idea that we were the result of a set of random mutations 
mad and that the aspects of the theory still seem actually hard to get hold of even though science 
science thinks that more or less true take the idea of lucretius says that your eyes come into being 
order to enable you to see that they were just random mutations and then it turned out to be 
to be able to see you could also pick up the food that you needed but the idea that 
still very hard to grasp i find it hard to grasp the idea that your eyes in all of 
unbelievable complexity emerged in an evolutionary way without purpose as it were without clear direction that seems impossible sc 
it was exactly what william paley used for his clockmaker analogy when he said that we had to be 
right sg yes exactly sc and ironically the eye seems to be one of the easiest things for evolution 
discover been evolved in different species over and over again throughout history well good what happens when we die 
good to know things how tyrants come to be i think no question that these are all questions that 
not gone away i think we have a lot to think about in the modern world sg yes true 
alright stephen greenblatt thanks so much for being on the podcast sg thank you sean music hi sean i 
your podcast an avid listener and listen to this one sure before the over a minor question or minor 
though lol trump just came to my mind aughh might it be even better to include your name and 
in addition to your guest in the file download name lastly love to hear an hour long exchange between 
and sarah haider which would add even more dimensionality to your podcast portfolio awesome work sean i appreciate that 
wish to broaden the scope of your podcasts to include discussions such as this i have long been fascinated 
the misuse of the adam and eve story by fundamentalist christians because it is not their story christians should 
jewish rabbis for their interpretation however i do find an interesting link to evolution in the trio of man 
and snake we know that we share the most primitive portion of our brain with reptiles therefore we have 
same primitive drives for survival self preservation and procreation that are possessed by reptiles it is easier to understand 
power of the story when we realize that a brain resides within each and every one of us and 
the source of some of our most powerful impulses how we control and channel those impulses is the challenge 
all face thanks doc i am being sarcastic you just had to mention you what universes did you open 
doing that do you have any idea how much work you set in motion for me now i have 
drop all my study of tensorflowjs and machine learning because you mentioned lucretius he leads me back forty years 
revisit emerson twain milton and jefferson besides having memorized the first twentysix lines of paradise lost and reciting it 
as a mental exercise i can well imagine that a reading of the epic poem followed immediately by epic 
will be rich beyond my feeble expression i am sure to be awed i read the life of pi 
immediately by a reading of the old man and the sea incredible experience i told others and they confirmed 
experience back to lecture thanks for nothing what a wonderful conversation i really really enjoyed it thanks sean diálogo
