so i still kind of think of entropy as somewhat bound up with space so for example the gas molecules that are in half the box versus the whole box and the probability of finding one of those molecules in a particular place and so on and so on so if
i still kind of think of entropy as somewhat bound up with space so for example the gas molecules that are in half the box versus the whole box and the probability of finding one of those molecules in a particular place and so on and so on so if you

up with space so for example the gas molecules that are in half the box versus the whole box and the probability of finding one of those molecules in a particular place and so on and so on so if you suddenly doubled the size of the box and all particles

example the gas molecules that are in half the box versus the whole box and the probability of finding one of those molecules in a particular place and so on and so on so if you suddenly doubled the size of the box and all particles were on the one side
the gas molecules that are in half the box versus the whole box and the probability of finding one of those molecules in a particular place and so on and so on so if you suddenly doubled the size of the box and all particles were on the one side then
