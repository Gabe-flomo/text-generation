the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and if anything like me surrounded by other people who are wrong 
all sorts of important things now of course people can be wrong for all sorts of different reasons right 
mean maybe just not that smart maybe they just end up being not quite clever enough to get the 
answer or maybe just not informed to be a little bit less judgmental about it maybe they have the 
background the right information to reach correct conclusions but other people who you no doubt notice seem to be 
smart and yet keep getting things wrong or at least get something wrong in a really really important way 
in some sense their fault right if someone is just uninformed you blame them for being wrong unless you 
them for being uninformed but you could just say well they know any better sc but cases out there 
you recognize that people really should know better and something about that person that is preventing them from being 
my guest today is quassim cassam he is a philosopher at the university of warwick in the uk and 
a book on intellectual vices the book is called vices of the mind from the intellectual to the political 
the point of the word vice here is that this is something that is preventing you from getting the 
answer in a blameworthy way sc all talked about cognitive biases or other things like that sometimes the cognitive 
can be an intellectual vice but other times sort of inevitable so a slightly different kind of category cassam 
talking about all the different ways in which people get things wrong in important but in principal correctable ways 
that we can really blame them for getting wrong and of course we can go on about the current 
situation and wonder whether or not the people we disagree with are subject to these intellectual vices one way 
the other i think that the important thing here from my perspective is we all have these vices ourselves 
should be some way to get better at it so we talk a little bit about where these vices 
from why they exist why it is worth blaming someone for being wrong in these different ways and then 
course how we ourselves can be better at it sc i wanna remind you that we have a website 
the podcast preposterousuniversecompodcast on the website for every different post for every different episode of mindscape you can find 
only links to the stuff but you can also find a full transcript of every episode also a patreon 
linked to from the website and if wondering why a patreon even though there are ads on the podcast 
you can get an adfree version of the podcast if you subscribe and support on patreon as well as 
ask me anything episode so there are still reasons to be a patreon supporter as well as of course 
undying gratitude with that go music sc quassim cassam welcome to the mindscape podcast quassim cassam hello there sean 
to be here sc now a professional philosopher an epistemologist i think safe to say and i know a 
bit about epistemology not that much my experience with epistemology is that a somewhat dry field people are talking 
the sense data we collect how to verify propositions and things like that but involved in a project in 
with what you call intellectual vices that seems a lot more grounded down to earth related to psychology and 
people live and talk in the world so why you give us a little bit of background on epistemology 
and then how your project fits into that qc yeah so epistemology i think can often be a very 
field so epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge so lots of questions that epistemologists typically ask questions like 
is it to know something what are the sources of human knowledge questions like that so these are very 
highlevel general questions and although epistemologists usually use examples to illustrate their points and their claims the examples they 
tend to be rather kind contrived madeup examples that are designed to make the point they want to make 
i have to confess that a lot of my own work in the past has been a bit like 
but in the last few years become quite interested in seeing how to apply epistemology the philosophical insights about 
nature of knowledge to the real world problems to real world issues and particularly political questions and political issues 
a kind of branch of epistemology now which people call political epistemology and i guess really what doing political 
is an attempt to connect epistemology with questions about how politics works and how it work and that really 
the kind of inspiration for my book and i say at the beginning that i was really motivated to 
the book by the way politics seemed to be going both in the uk and in the us particularly 
two thousand sixteen with major events on both sides of the atlantic and before that the iraq war i 
kind of discussions of all of those subjects in my book and i try to account for them using 
notion which you mentioned the notion of an intellectual or an epistemic vice and i guess i should say 
about that if like me to sc well yeah i mean i think that i personally and i hope 
mindscape listeners are very familiar with ideas like cognitive biases or ways in which we can be irrational but 
is slightly different slant closely related in the same neighborhood but a vice seems much more normative much more 
so yeah tell us what an intellectual vice is qc yeah so one thing that maybe distinguishes vices intellectual 
and indeed even moral vices from cognitive biases is that vices are clearly personal qualities so vices are personal 
that one person may have and another person may not have so some people say are closeminded and others 
not arrogance is a characteristic that some people have and others maybe wishful thinking is something that some people 
more prone to than others and so on qc one difference because certainly when people talk about cognitive biases 
think they tend to think of them as universal more or less and in many cases is operating not 
the level of the person but at the level of their brains and the way their brains process information 
the first thing to say about the notion of a vice now these personal qualities can take many different 
so some vices i want to say take the form of character traits so closemindedness you might think of 
a character trait or there are vices that take the form of ways of thinking like wishful thinking and 
there are vices that take the form of attitudes so for example you might think of prejudice as an 
and as an intellectual vice so the next thing to say about these vices but the really big point 
this a vice is things kind of bad the basic notion of a vice qc so virtues are good 
qualities to have and vice is a bad personal qualities to have so traditionally of course people thought very 
about moral virtues and vices in this connection so classically courage was seen as a moral virtue and cowardice 
a moral vice so intellectual vices and virtues are intellectual qualities that people have which are either good for 
to have that contribute to their intellectual flourishing or bad qualities for them to have and those are the 
vices and just this again i think relates to your question about cognitive biases so when people talk about 
and vices i think a really strong intuition that your virtues and vices are things for which you can 
praised or blamed or criticized or admired qc so the virtues are supposed to be kind of admirable personal 
qualities for which you might reasonably be praised and vices are the opposite dis admirable qualities and that again 
a difference with at least some cognitive biases where not so clear that notions are praise and blame so 
you have the story so there are personal qualities there are intellectual qualities in the case of vices there 
personal intellectual qualities that are in some sense bad for us intellectually speaking and lastly there are personal qualities 
which we can be blamed or criticized so the basic notion of an intellectual vice sc right and this 
begs the question of whether or not or under what circumstances is it okay to blame somebody or give 
responsibility sort of a free will volition kind of issue that comes in here do we imagine that vices 
things that people could choose to change if they wanted to or at least that they could try to 
them qc yeah so a really fundamental question about virtues and vices so absolutely right so if gonna talk 
blame particularly then it seems as though you have to think that vices are things that people are responsible 
and then if you think people are responsible for them then it looks as though they need to have 
kind of control over them and then people worry that we really have control of our own character traits 
how can we be blamed for them so i think the discussion of this issue is a really complicated 
so one thing i would wanna say is that with respect to at least some vices i think that 
is a really big issue if you think of vices that take the form of attitudes to say that 
have control over them is to say that possible for us to change or alter our attitudes and indeed 
think it is possible in at least some cases qc similarly possible to change at least to some extent 
way we think the hardest case is character traits where much more tempting to think of them as completely 
and unalterable not sure i really buy that i think that we again are not completely victims of our 
character and that there is some possibility of revision the question really is how easy is it for us 
revise our character traits or our attitudes or our thinking styles so one cluster of issues but i just 
give you an example which maybe is helpful so this is an example suggested by a philosopher called heather 
so imagine a young man in an area of pakistan who is brought up in a taliban control village 
because of the way this guy has been brought up he has all sorts of prejudices say prejudices against 
for example so he thinks that women should not be allowed out of the house unless accompanied by an 
male relative qc now of course if you ask why does this person think this and what kind of 
does this person have over this attitude of so the natural thing to think is well he thinks these 
not because true and i guess they true but he thinks these things because of his circumstances and his 
and the community and culture which he lives in and then to say he has control over these seems 
because you might wanna say how can he change those but i think it is worth noting in this 
that whatever we think about the issue of control or change i think he is completely off the hook 
mean it seems to me that it would be all to say that straightforwardly blameworthy for his attitudes maybe 
quite the right notion here qc but nevertheless i think perfectly reasonable to criticize his attitudes right i mean 
are really bad attitudes to have and i think criticism is completely appropriate in these cases and then of 
the question is are you criticizing his attitudes or are you criticizing right so maybe some scope for saying 
doubt he has terrible attitudes and its okay to criticizes his attitudes but that person being criticized is him 
beyond a certain point is quite hard to sustain the distinction between a attitudes and the person because you 
think a person is in some sense made up of his attitudes and character traits and so on sc 
seems that the discussion presumes that there is some shared or maybe even universal objective kind of goal that 
have when being epistemologists or when trying to think about the world that we all want truth and probably 
easier discussion to have when talking about scientific or physical natural facts about the world than about moral stances 
so is that a fair thing to say that we can only have this discussion about an intellectual vice 
we agree that we all want to get things right at the end of the day and we more 
less agree on what it would mean to get things right qc yeah i suppose fair enough i guess 
rather than talking about truth i think wanna say that what we want and need as human beings is 
of the world around us something we actually need just to survive and just to get by and the 
thing that we look for is understanding not just a matter of knowing that certain propositions are true but 
also want to understand why true or how true and how they fit in with other things that we 
qc so now of course if somebody says well look no such thing as knowledge or no such thing 
truth then quite right that ends the discussion although wanna probe them a bit more about why they think 
things but i think for most people and hopefully for most people listening to this podcast we do think 
possible for us to know some of the things and that there are personal qualities that make it easier 
us to know things about the world around us and personal qualities that make it much more difficult to 
knowledge or understanding of the world around us so the vices are then these personal qualities that get in 
way of our ability to know or understand the world around us and if somebody were to say to 
in all seriousness yeah well fine but who cares about knowledge or understanding i think be inclined to think 
not really being serious the kind of provocative remark that people make for the sake of argument but i 
a very sensible thing to say qc supposing you have a young child and you are considering whether to 
the child vaccinations recommended by your doctor i guess you really wanna know the right thing to do a 
pressing practical question for you and if somebody were to say yeah but look who cares about knowledge we 
to worry about knowing whether this is the right thing to do or not for your child i just 
what anyone seriously believes and the same goes for each of us in our own lives you want to 
things and if you want to know things not really gonna get very far in your life now wanting 
you need to have the intellectual resources to actually know stuff and these intellectual resources are gonna include personal 
that either make it easier or more difficult for you to know sc just home in exactly on this 
between intellectual vice and a cognitive bias on the one hand the vice is something you can be blamed 
on the other hand the bias might be deeper ingrained and you help it in fact in some sense 
could even be useful in thinking fast kind of way shortcut heuristic that get us to places but they 
at the same time maybe some examples of one versus the other would help people clear things up qc 
so a good example is something like confirmation bias so confirmation bias is something that i think we all 
from the tendency to look for information that supports what we already believe and the corresponding tendency to ignore 
that goes the other way so confirmation bias i suppose you can certainly imagine circumstances in which confirmation bias 
gonna be bad for you if what you already believe is true then confirmation bias gonna get in the 
of your grasp for the truth just gonna strengthen your already true beliefs but maybe this goes back to 
thing you were saying about traditionally epistemology one thing that traditionally epistemology has always thought i think and i 
this is true is it knowing just a matter of having beliefs that are true knowing also involves having 
which you are justified in having and so some sense in which knowledge requires justified beliefs beliefs based on 
example evidence or good reasoning or solid information qc so in the case of confirmation bias if a particular 
of yours is sustained by this bias by kind of unthinking confirmation bias even if that belief of yours 
to be true and even if you are confirmed in that true belief by your bias still gonna be 
because still not going to be the case that your belief is justified if it is really sustained by 
cognitive bias and nothing else having said all that i think i think perfectly true that the distinction between 
biases and intellectual vices a sharp one and there may be as you were suggesting there may be a 
of area where they shade into one another so i think there are these two things to think about 
is is there a sharp distinction between the two and i would wanna say there a sharp distinction between 
two but there is some distinction between the two and the other thing is to think about the conditions 
knowing and how knowing requires actually having beliefs that are justified not just beliefs that are true sc you 
some wonderful examples in the book you did this wonderful thing where in every chapter you begin with another 
example of intellectual vices getting away well share some of those with the audience a lot of them are 
so just the price we pay for this but there are certainly examples in history where regardless of what 
thought at the time should have happened in retrospect people made mistakes and you say that in some cases 
can attribute those mistakes to really pretty severe intellectual vices qc yeah yeah so the example i start the 
off with is the two thousand three iraq war so with that example not really interested there in the 
of whether the us was right or wrong to invade iraq in that more about whether given that the 
had decided or did decide to invade iraq what went wrong with the military preparations for the invasion so 
i guess relatively uncontroversial now that it all went horribly wrong and a really important practical question politically militarily 
in other ways to figure out how things went so badly wrong why was the us apparently so illprepared 
this very complicated operation now if you look back at the way the operation was planned and the attitudes 
those planning it one thing that i think you can see fairly clearly is considerable intellectual arrogance the assumption 
senior people in the then administration that they knew best they knew what they were doing they really have 
listen to what the military planners were telling them qc and that was the sort of arrogant overconfident attitude 
led to disaster overconfidence is another one which i just mentioned overconfidence is a really powerful force in our 
and when it comes to wars and military planning absolutely catastrophic and i think that the overconfidence of the 
administration i think was a real problem in that case so there are just two examples of intellectual vices 
caused serious practical difficulties other people have other analyses and diagnoses of what went wrong but fairly kinda interesting 
many of these analyses really do talk about either intellectual vices or cognitive biases even if you think about 
whole business about weapons of mass destruction wmd and the inquiry into whether iraq did or have wmd in 
of course there was lots of talk about confirmation bias the assumption that iraq had wmd and then the 
to interpret all evidence as supporting that assumption qc another thing that people talk about in this connection is 
the tendency for a bunch of people to all collectively as a group all agree with one another and 
move in a particular direction so these are all whether you wanna call them cognitive biases or whether you 
to call them intellectual vices these are all examples of call them intellectual defects or intellectual failings or intellectual 
that had a major impact on the conduct of the war and had a major impact on the way 
preparations were made and then in later chapters of course i give other examples a chapter dedicated to the 
vote in the uk and the whole issue of how that was argued for and how that was presented 
in that context one issue is what attitude was towards expert evidence about the consequences of the uk leaving 
eu and there are certainly plenty of examples which i quote in the book of people basically saying just 
to worry about what the experts tell us we know how things are and we just need to worry 
the facts there are the facts and then there are the facts that the expert tell us but then 
are our facts the alternative qc and that is an attitude which i think is deeply destructive as well 
had destructive consequences in that debate so a kind of general question that people might wanna think about if 
about political developments politics in the last five or ten years can you think of particular political events or 
or developments where the intellectual vices of some of the major actors played a big part in producing the 
outcomes that we saw i suspect that most listeners to this podcast have much difficulty in thinking of examples 
this thing clearly which examples you come up with is rather gonna depend on what your politics are i 
i can imagine people on the democratic side in the us immediately thinking of your current president when looking 
examples to illustrate intellectual vices in action but equally sure that people on the other side will have different 
sc these examples are great because it highlights how what talking about forget about cognitive biases for a second 
not just foolishness or stupidity or ignorance that talking about here an you distinguished between attitudes styles of thinking 
character traits that actively get in the way of getting to the truth and that it gives you sort 
it gives people i think a handle on how the vices are special and that they could be improved 
just a lack of knowledge some way of thinking that you have that is actively obstructing you from getting 
the truth qc yeah so let me give you another example so one of the chapters talks about the 
case of the one thousand nine hundred seventythree yom kippur war so this is something been really extensively studied 
israel and elsewhere so just to remind people of the history so in israeli intelligence was starting to receive 
reports of military preparations by the egyptians and syrians preparations that pointed to an impending attack by egypt and 
on israel now at that time the director of military intelligence in israel was someone who was very strongly 
to the belief that the arabs would not attack simplifying a bit but i think his view was that 
would be crazy to attack and therefore that they attack and therefore that any evidence indicating that they were 
to attack was not reliable that all such evidence could simply be dismissed qc so well what happened well 
course what happened was that they did attack so they attacked on yom kippur in that year and because 
serious preparations had been made on the israeli side the initial phase of that war went very badly for 
eventually they turned things around but in fact the egyptians managed to cross the suez canal virtually unopposed at 
outset now if thinking about the vice here all very interesting but the vice that talking well the vice 
talking about in that case is closedmindedness so this is a case of someone so talking here about the 
of military intelligence in israel someone who had arrived at a certain view had as they say frozen on 
certain conception of what would and would not happen qc so frozen on the idea that israel would not 
attacked at that time having fixed on that idea his mind was really closed to all alternative perspectives so 
closemindedness where you are simply not willing to give serious consideration to other points of view to other perspectives 
not just other points of view also not being willing to give serious consideration to actual concrete evidence in 
case intelligence that points the other way now of course we all know what happened there was a real 
price paid by israel for that now if thinking about what can we do about this can we do 
to guard against well of course the obvious thing is to put structures in place to make sure that 
in these positions of power are really forced to consider alternative perspectives even if not really inclined to and 
can go too far but nevertheless really important that people in these positions are seriously willing to engage with 
perspectives qc so a case an example the example i gave is really an example of a particular intellectual 
closedmindedness and if you think about what the impact of that vice was the impact was that it it 
the director of military intelligence in israel from knowing something that he would and could otherwise have known he 
all the evidence necessary to know that an attack was about to happen he failed to know it why 
he fail to know it because he ignored the evidence why did he ignore the evidence because he had 
made up his mind and was closedminded and so there you have a kind of explanation of a series 
series of events and what i call a vice expansion an explanation of how things turned out that in 
the intellectual vices of one or more people is doing important explanatory work and i think that this explanation 
particularly hightech i think a perfectly common sensical explanation and also interestingly an explanation been given by people who 
what went wrong in that case not just making this up qc there is actual evidence that this is 
what happened and there are quite a few references in the book to the relevant literature on this subject 
the rather odd that i keep coming back to military examples but these are examples where just easier to 
the point another case was the much older example operation barbarossa when the nazis invaded the soviet union again 
russians under stalin had plenty of intelligence that the nazis were about to attack stalin was convinced that they 
to attack and get this for closemindedness so stalin was so convinced that the nazis were not going to 
that he had people who reported that they were going to attack he had them shot closedmindedness sc but 
is an excellent example to sort of dig into a little bit the example of closemindedness because you sneaked 
there the statement possible to be too openminded and you have the case in your book of what about 
denial where you say not a super expert in the holocaust you know the basics but just not interested 
spending your time reading the purported evidence from holocaust denialists so where exactly do we draw this line between 
openminded and close minded is there an objective way to do it or is it a more practical wisdom 
of thing qc yeah i think a very practical question so just go back just go back to aristotle 
back a long way so lots of modern talk about virtues and vices originates in aristotle so aristotle had 
i think absolutely brilliant idea and i think it still is correct which is with all these qualities that 
talking about possible to have too much of something and possible to have too little of something and possible 
have just the right amount of it so the virtuous person who has neither too much nor too little 
the classic example is courage so courage is a virtue on the other side of courage is cowardice where 
have as it were too little courage and then on the other side on the opposite side you have 
which is where you have as it were an excess of courage so you have vices of excess vices 
deficiency and then the virtue in the middle qc so i think the same is true in the case 
intellectual virtues and vices so if thinking about closedmindedness as a vice and openmindedness as a virtue so then 
question is so what would be the extreme what would be the case where you are as you were 
openminded so that might be the vice of gullibility so the openminded person the virtuous person is someone whose 
of course their mind has to be open to the extent of being willing to consider serious alternative options 
what they think so they need to not dismiss views just because they are at odds with their own 
but also true that to function in the world as a noah and as a someone with understanding you 
at some point got to take some questions as having been settled qc and having reached that point you 
to take seriously every single alternative perspective proposed however illfounded that perspective is so a question that i take 
be settled is the question of the reality of the holocaust i take that to be overwhelming historical evidence 
the holocaust happened in just the way that we were all taught now of course there are holocaust deniers 
holocaust deniers say that say things like hitler know anything about it or hitler order it or that far 
jews were killed in the holocaust than the six million figure normally given and so on and so forth 
if somebody were to say look if openminded surely you gotta take those claims seriously surely got to be 
to consider qc i think my answer to that is well it depends on what you mean by those 
aware that those claims have been made and also aware that those claims have been refuted been rebutted and 
fact speaking for myself i have actually read some of those rebuttals and i found them kind of convincing 
having somebody saying to me but look it could still be true and i wanna say in this case 
actually is evidence that settles the question so i think when people talk about closedmindedness i think a mistake 
think that just because you think that certain questions have been settled just because you think that the evidence 
indeed point in one direction rather than another that in itself makes you closedminded qc openmindedness so the virtue 
openmindedness then quite a kind of delicate matter to say what it involves and i guess in a way 
simplest way to put it would be to say neither an excess nor a and no mathematical formula for 
sc good exactly what i was gonna get at because i know in physics among scientists and among many 
and among me in my past life there was this really strong desire for a mathematical formula right like 
we were trying to say something deep and profound about either the world or wisdom or how to live 
lives there should be clear cut guidelines and as i age into what is hopefully greater amounts of wisdom 
becoming impressed or fascinated by the idea that sometimes there just clear bright lines between these things and in 
also something that comes up you know utilitarians can be thought of as people who want to find the 
for how we should act in all these different circumstances and increasingly of the opinion that the formula exist 
you think a healthy or a disastrous philosophical attitude qc i think an incredibly sensible attitude actually and even 
there is a formula not clear that you necessarily have to use it let me give you an example 
think about cooking now of course there are recipes to cook recipes that you can follow that tell you 
how much of each ingredient is required now of course possible to follow those recipes but i mean one 
is that in the case of many recipes it actually matter very much or matter at all if there 
minor variations around the quantities that are given in the recipes and of course really really good cooks rely 
recipes they just have a feel for the right amount of salt or the right amount of chilly sc 
qc and i think just life that people with practical wisdom are people who just have just a kind 
know what to call it a kind of instinctive sense of just right and wrong and if supposing going 
a drinks party and thinking we wanna stay too long we wanna to stay so long that the host 
annoyed with us but equally we wanna leave too early because we wanna be right so then imagine saying 
your partner so figure this out exactly how many minutes do we need to stay for it to be 
right number of qc now that would be a kinda really stupid approach to this because of course in 
what happens if sensible is that you go to the drinks party and then depending on how things are 
you kind of have a feel for when time to go so you kinda you realize that basically if 
turn around and walk out of the door within thirty minutes probably gonna offend them and you know equally 
if you stick around until three in the morning probably also a really bad idea so the good point 
good place the good time to leave the party is gonna be some time between half an hour and 
but no formula for that no formula for that just that sensible people will actually kind of just be 
to work it out all right and be a range and leaving any time in that range is going 
be basically fine and i think really these examples of the drinks party and the cook i think they 
very much in the spirit of what suggesting about life that the search for rigid formulae is just silly 
mean life mostly life just like that laughter sc like i said i am moving in that direction where 
try to be hard on myself and i try to avoid the intellectual vices here i worry that just 
cop out that because i know what the formula is i deny that there is a formula so in 
denying the existence of the formula and insisting that it must be there qc yeah so what okay so 
me ask you a question so in the case of the drinks party would you wanna say a formula 
that case sc i think i get the example a very very good one very relatable i say impossible 
a formula i think that the way that you said it up is cheating a little bit because it 
like we have to decide how many minutes ahead of time but maybe a formula that says the data 
while there given the eyebrows of the host and sitting on the couch there is a way to figure 
but on the other hand maybe not because i think that once we get into the realm of normativity 
judgment i think not such a matter of too hard just that the criteria themselves are fuzzy qc yeah 
is absolutely the key word there that so much so much is a matter of judgment and i think 
actually good judgment sounds like a very good candidate for being an intellectual virtue and poor judgment is a 
good candidate for being an intellectual vice and if you think about people with bad judgement you think about 
lives they end up living mostly a terrible thing for them just on a personal level leave aside intellectual 
even on a personal level having bad judgment is something that has a real impact on us and something 
we really want to need to avoid and i think a kind of illustration of a point quite keen 
emphasize in the book which is that when we talk and talk about virtues and vices although using labels 
closemindedness and dogmatism and so on all of these are quite abstract labels not really talking here about something 
abstract talking about stuff that actually makes an enormous practical difference in our day to day lives sc sure 
and of course in the political world in the military world and in medical world all of these things 
consequences they have real world impacts and if thinking about why do you classify closemindedness as a vice and 
do you classify humility as a well got to be because you think that gonna do better intellectually speaking 
indeed personally speaking with a bit of humility than if you are closeminded so we are talking here about 
philosophical but also very practical sc is there some sort of grand unified theory of intellectual vices is there 
single err vice from which everything else spills or is it just a mishmash of different things that are 
us from getting to the truth qc well i think more of a mishmash than they being a single 
theory if you want a grand theory then my offering in the book is what i call obstructivism obstructivism 
says that intellectual vices are personal qualities that systematically get in the way of knowledge and that we can 
blamed or criticized for so your kind of uber theory of what an intellectual vice is so because so 
focus on these vices getting in the way of knowledge i tend to refer to them in the book 
epistemic vices but basically the same thing so your kind of general characterization but then the question is okay 
told me that there are personal qualities that get in the way of knowledge and that are kind of 
for it but well which qualities are these qc now when you get to that level then of course 
start to think about what are the different qualities that can have these impacts and what unifies them and 
do we kind of classify so i tend to be quite relaxed about this in the book i give 
i said earlier examples of character traits ways of thinking and attitudes that i wanna say are intellectual vices 
maybe there are other kinds of intellectual vice quite open about this i think we should be too rigid 
too dogmatic about about the different kinds of vice that there are but the important point is that got 
be personal qualities that systematically get in the way of knowledge andor understanding or if one prefers and got 
be some room for blame or criticism if somebody says if this is a but of course if somebody 
his vice you possibly blame them or criticize the more indeed say anything but negative about them on account 
this then i wanna say then not a it is got to make sense to blame or criticize or 
evaluate somebody if what they have is really a genuine intellectual vice sc could we imagine that things could 
improved if there were an insistence on greater transparency about what people believed i know that some people have 
so far as to suggest that everyone should make bets on what they think is true in some public 
or prediction markets is part of the problem with intellectual vice is that not enough accountability for being wrong 
these things qc well not sure that the case if you think about accountability in the end the world 
out a certain way and then it becomes apparent what the flaws were in your thinking i mean if 
about the iraq war example so this was a very controversial question in the runup to the war how 
american troops would be needed to carry out a successful invasion of iraq so as i understand it there 
huge variations in the numbers there that there were people in the military who thought that the number needed 
be something like i know or something like a really big number and then there were people in the 
administration who thought that the number needed would be much smaller you know or or something like that now 
you were to say to these guys so i really wanna know what you really believe about this okay 
put your money where your mouth is how much are you willing to bet on so maybe the people 
the smaller number side said that willing to bet a certain amount on the number being small and the 
on the other side were willing to bet a certain amount on the number being large and maybe they 
willing to bet the same amounts both sides believed with equal strength in what they were saying qc but 
in itself really get us anywhere because then the question is were the people who believed the number was 
small justified in believing that and whether the people who believed that the number was really big justified in 
i mean the question and not a question about the strength of your belief or the strength of your 
a question about whether you actually have good grounds for your beliefs now in that case i mean i 
have said that even before the whole even before we knew the outcome that the people on the small 
side of things were actually wrong that they justified in believing what they said and one reason they justified 
believing it is that it went against expert military advice the people who were defending the large number were 
tended to be professional soldiers and the people defending the small number tended to be professional politicians qc and 
the choice between believing a professional soldier and a professional politician i think know what i would pick but 
any case you know history turned out the way it turned out and one side was proved right and 
side was proved wrong so not transparency the issue if by transparency you mean got to be transparent what 
think in this case it was perfectly transparent what the different sides to the debate thought i mean what 
wrong is that some people thought the things that they thought on good grounds and others thought the things 
they thought on not very good grounds and the fundamental point sc probably if we were having this discussion 
we would bring up examples like this of intellectual vices and we might even say it seems to be 
these intellectual vices are becoming more prevalent in some way at least in the political realm and then fifteen 
later probably saying my god how naive we were back now really being prevalent is there any way to 
fair about talking about whether or not there is some large scale shift towards putting up with or accepting 
even intentionally leaning into this kind of wishful thinking closedmindedness sets of vices qc yeah so very hard to 
this question without being political i mean i would say that things have certainly become more vicious in every 
in the last in the last ten or fifteen years so one manifestation of this it used to be 
case i think that politicians who would say things that were clearly false and unfounded would be criticized for 
and there will be people pointing out that what they were saying was false and that would make a 
it good for them politically to be discovered to be talking nonsense the thing that seems to have happened 
is that it seems now that actually making false and unfounded and ridiculous claims is not only politically acceptable 
politically effective and it seems as though plenty of voters no longer regard it as a fatal defect in 
politicians that they talk nonsense say things that are just plainly that are plainly not true qc so this 
discussion of the notion of bullshit so a philosopher called harry frankfurt wrote this absolutely brilliant essay about thirty 
ago called on bullshit where he distinguishes between lying and bullshitting so the liar says things that he knows 
false and he says them in order to deceive other people whereas the bullshitter frankfurt says is someone who 
care whether the things he says are true or false they just have no concern with truth at all 
so i think one way of thinking about what seen in politics in the last few years has been 
increase in bullshit levels in politics where bullshit is now being almost being used as a kind of technique 
politics where you say something without you say something about immigration or climate change or whatever it is and 
say something seemingly with no concern at all about whether what saying is true or justified or wellfounded and 
i was saying i think forty years ago that would have got you into some trouble and politicians actually 
to some length to try to avoid being caught doing that kind of thing whereas now it seems to 
politically acceptable to bullshit qc and the attitude that underpins bullshit this attitude of not giving a shit about 
truth or the evidence i mean that attitude is an example of an intellectual vice a very powerful and 
days rather common one in the political realm so i so my general take on this is fairly pessimistic 
mean i think things have been getting worse someone wrote a book actually in which they talked about something 
they called peak bullshit and i guess the interesting question is we now have we reached peak bullshit or 
there even more bullshit still to always a temptation to think things possibly get any worse and sometimes they 
sc oh no qc so i think we really need to we need to be worried we need to 
really concerned about the lowering of the intellectual tone and caliber of political debate i think a really terribly 
worrying thing and even more worrying than the fact that politicians do it is the fact that a lot 
voters just seem to care so a rather downbeat assessment but what i think anyway sc well and not 
politicians right among the people who are not professional politicians not only is there a greater acceptance of people 
do not seem to be that invested in telling the truth but i know that you have a new 
coming out on conspiracy theories qc yeah sc is is there an increase in the acceptance of conspiracy theories 
that handinhand with the acceptance of bullshit qc well and this is a really interesting question i mean of 
everyone thinks that conspiracy theories are more popular now than they have ever been that living in an age 
conspiracy i mean interestingly been some research done on this question about particularly a belief in conspiracy theories in 
us and the empirical evidence is that belief in conspiracy theories has actually been going down in the us 
going up so there is an issue here about what the actual facts are i mean the research showing 
is really really really good and very kind of ingenious and i think quite quite convincing nevertheless leaving aside 
question of whether conspiracy theories are more or less prevalent true that conspiracy theories are popular and influential across 
world and particularly in the us and one might wanna think one might want to relate the whole issue 
belief in conspiracy theories to intellectual vices and maybe something in that but actually in the book on conspiracy 
which just finished and which is coming out soon actually much more interested in the idea that conspiracy theories 
at least the sort of big ticket conspiracy theories are really forms of political propaganda that what they really 
is to advance a political agenda and really their role qc and i think conspiracy theories are used quite 
of selfconsciously in that way if you i mean this is a very contentious example but if you are 
opposed to gun control in the us and you are confronted by all these terrible mass shootings then of 
you know gonna be quite tempting to say that these are false flags or that some of these were 
flags and just a way to deflect criticism of gun use so an example of how a conspiracy theory 
not just a theory a way to make a political point and to advance a political agenda and if 
think of them that way not even clear that the people who put these theories forward have necessarily believed 
the thing that people often ask is well why do people believe conspiracy theories and i think worth actually 
pausing to reflect on the distinction between the people who invent and promote these theories and consumers of these 
and i think true that everyone who invents these theories believes them and i even necessarily think true that 
of conspiracy theories necessarily believe them either but the fundamental point is that to think about conspiracy theories you 
have to think about their political role their political function and then i wanna say that the function of 
theories is fundamentally forms of propaganda sc okay good definitely looking forward to that book but before we go 
do wanna circle back to this idea or this question of what we personally do about the possibility that 
are subject to intellectual vices whenever i hear people talk about irrationality and cognitive biases and so forth you 
always see people in the audience going yes my intellectual enemies are subject to all these and much harder 
look at ourselves but happily written a whole book on selfknowledge is there an intersection between the search for 
selfknowledge and the guarding ourselves against intellectual vices because probably there that many people who say yeah i proudly 
this particular intellectual qc yeah yeah so i mean i think true that to actually do something about your 
intellectual vices you need to recognize that you have them and most of us are really bad at recognizing 
own intellectual vices i mean very easy at recognizing the vices of other people but not our own vices 
one thing i say in the book is that one explanation for that is that many of our intellectual 
are what i call stealthy vices vices that actually obstruct or block their own detection so this is i 
this is in the same ball park as the famous dunningkruger effect so the kind of pop version of 
dunningkruger effect is some people are too stupid to know how stupid they are so a case where the 
itself stupidity blocks its own detection by the person who has it who has that trait and i think 
true of many intellectual vices and of course as long as we recognize our own intellectual vices the whole 
of what gonna do about them even arise but although we are reluctant i think to recognize our own 
it actually an impossible thing to do and the way that our intellectual vices really come out is when 
have terrible consequences qc and when the consequences make it apparent that we have those vices again having bad 
a guarantee that recognize them because you may have other vices that make you explain it all away in 
other way so i guess i wanna say that there is a connection with the whole topic of selfknowledge 
is difficult to get to know our own intellectual vices because many of these vices are stealthy vices but 
impossible to know our own intellectual vices it is possible i think for some of us to actually be 
with ourselves and actually think in a serious way about our own intellectual attitudes and character traits and thinking 
and just one thing to just point out if you think of prejudice as an intellectual vice as well 
i believe a moral vice actually not true that people recognize their own prejudices seen an opinion survey of 
in the uk asking them you say that you are racially and something like a quarter or a third 
people said yes in answer to that question qc so actually not true that people recognize their own intellectual 
they do recognize them maybe these people who said that they were prejudiced accept that anything wrong with being 
but maybe some would maybe we should maybe we need to have a more sophisticated view about what truths 
themselves people are willing to recognize and what truths about themselves not willing to recognize sc yeah i guess 
mostly about things like wishful thinking because probably of the vices that gone through the one that i can 
in myself the most vividly i think that wishful thinking is bad i know that i do it i 
not to do it and yet i do it maybe better at avoiding it now than i was when 
was younger but i know are there exercises one can do is it should i be meditating or are 
just philosophical brainstretching exercises that i can train myself to have fewer intellectual vices qc well in the case 
wishful thinking a simple question to ask yourself is is this wishful thinking supposing you have a favorite sports 
and convinced that gonna win the super bowl or whatever it is i think a perfectly sensible question to 
yourself whenever you make a prediction like that is is this just wishful thinking am i saying this am 
thinking this because really the outcome that i want now maybe you be able to answer that question maybe 
be sure really driving you in this case but a question that you can certainly raise for yourself on 
occasions and something that i think all of us are able to do is after the event quite often 
to say i guess that was just wishful qc so not completely beyond us to accept that wishful thinking 
be playing a role and also detecting it after the event i suppose that possible to prevent it altogether 
think wishful thinking is just we are hardwired to do it to some extent but there are degrees of 
and i call my view in the book a kind of moderately optimistic view about some vices what i 
by that is that there is the kind of pessimist who says just stuck with these things just nothing 
we can do about and i think plausible but equally i also want to accept that tackling our own 
vices is difficult hard and that it always possible to do it very effectively but the choice between being 
in control and having no control i think somewhere in the middle we have some degree of control and 
matter of exercising whatever control we have over these personal qualities that are doing us no good sc i 
ask this earlier but it brings to mind this question of is there an intellectual vice of the sort 
unequal or biased attention to different things like if i see prejudice against my group hypersensitive to that and 
i see prejudice against someone group i go like you should suck it up and deal with is there 
intellectual vice that qualifies as that qc yeah a kind of bias right so that would be one way 
describe it this really an intellectual vice but something else a very powerful force a kind of persecution complex 
idea that stuff that happens to the ingroup is particularly terrible and much worse than anything that happens to 
groups so i think that would be a case where there are intellectual factors at play but there are 
kind of moral factors and maybe also something worth thinking about of how intellectual vices interact with moral vices 
whether really a sharp distinction between intellectual and moral failings and i think that a lot of the intellectual 
that i talk about seem also to be moral failings closemindedness seems to be a moral failing but then 
are other intellectual vices that not sure wanna call gullibility a moral failing or foolishness a moral failing so 
think kind of quite subtle there are quite subtle questions here about how these two things interact and the 
that you just gave is one that just brings out how complicated this is sc well it is complicated 
think that if nothing else the whole discussion probably is a little bit unfair but kind of depressing to 
that all these vices that all subject to that maybe sunlight is the best disinfectant if we keep talking 
them people will automatically become a little bit more selfcorrecting qc yeah hopefully right and the other thing that 
would urge people to do is not only to reflect on their own intellectual vices but also just to 
about why this topic really matters and think about these big political events and political developments and just think 
how these vices have really had a significant impact there and i think that should really bring home to 
that this really matters this just abstract philosophy it sc well had a couple of podcast episodes on the 
of democracy and i think maybe you make this point in the book or maybe i just overlaid it 
top but if we live in a democracy these things matter a lot we make choices the power of 
our future as a society and a polity is in our hands and therefore kind of our responsibility not 
for our personal lives but for the rest of the world to try to be as intellectually virtuous as 
can qc yeah absolutely so if thinking about the basis on which you vote for one side or for 
to work well quite important that voters actually know something about what the policies are of different political parties 
take the trouble to find stuff like that out and maybe one of the things is going wrong at 
moment is that people really interested in that so much as identity politics just voting on the basis of 
of us or not one of and had some pretty dramatic consequences on politics so i completely agree that 
really have a wellfunctioning democracy along with massive intellectual vices affecting both leaders and the led just not going 
end well sc yeah i suspected that these things are never gonna go away but we can at least 
up the good fight against them so quassim cassam thanks so much for being on the podcast qc no 
has been my pleasure thanks very much music i thought this was an excellent podcast overall but from fifty 
on it was truly insightful i will be buying all of books i am especially looking forward to his 
on conspiracy thinking nevertheless i think conspiracy theories are grounded in religious cultural economic and gender issues although i 
you can boil them down to the political cf witch trials in century england europe and america hopefully all 
friends will be able to take advantage of his thoughts on better themselves kelvin r throop for anyone interested 
wrote an unpublished tenpage piece on harry bullshit referred to most enthusiastically by profcassam about twelve years ago in 
i took idea that bullshit is characterized by an indifference on the part of the speaker or actor as 
the truth of what is spoken by the speaker or what action is taken by the actor shifted the 
of the analysis to the receiver and found the peculiar frustration attaching to bullshit in the fact that the 
feels there is no way to effectively counter the unsatisfying reception of something objectionable even and especially if normative 
or other standards exist or are even appealed to or implied by the speaker or actor as justification if 
will forgive me i will summarize the idea by quoting from the piece must submit on precisely those occasions 
clearcut rules which we think should moreorless automatically generate the kinds of objections we hold are clearly those which 
in the wider moral civic or other kind of community but far from being able to appeal to these 
sense we are threatened not to with anything from implicit ridicule or indifference to outandout is this visceral sense 
casually enforced and illegitimate isolation from a community of listeners who according to their own publicized standards of behavior 
communication would seem to an enthusiastic hearing of our objections that seems to characterize bullshit and take it out 
the realm of normal discourse and invest it with the kind of desperation that has always been the wellspring 
the to me this notion goes beyond much celebrated piece in an essential way which involves an indispensable social 
for the phenomenon and makes it appear as much more than what remains to frankfurt an essentially individual one 
also think the conception i am putting forward says much about the trumptype phenomena we are all surrounded with 
though the appeal to wider communities is becoming narrow to the point of insignificance for many but there it 
i would love to see discussion or criticism if anyone is interested i hope you mind dr carroll my 
of your wonderful content for my own purpose here but i did think posting this was relevant and might 
some people thank you doctor and please please keep up the terrific work found the concept very interesting however 
fails to justify being to new ideas in his counter example of holocaust deniers i am not one btw 
leaves a big question on his work by downplaying sceptisism where are well established and case is this exactly 
thought process that the author defines as narrow mindedness curios how the thinking about vices change in the context 
a community for example my tendency for confirmation bias may be a vice for me but not necessarily a 
for the community we actually make progress when energized individuals focus on a point of view and present their 
to a disinterested audience as is the case in debates court hearings and science journal articles sooner or later 
rationality is well rationed we all can if we choose work on enlarging the ratio of rationality and evaluate 
as the person to laurence peterson thank you for your summary of work i also found another helpful piece 
jeet heer in the new republic that was very accessible alas thoughts did not prevent trump from behaving badly 
then on there seems to be an unfortunate immunity or numbness that just perplexes me i hope the podcast 
and sink in soon thank you mr trout for your interest and kind words regarding the frankfurt piece and 
and thank you again sean carroll for this wonderful podcast kilgore trout a vonnegut the challenge is to recognize 
intellectual vice and not succumb to it there is nothing new about claiming an intellectual opponent suffers from a 
defect trump opponents do it all the time you could say it is a device common to political speech 
have encountered a more modern term for the bullshit artist such a person is said to be the quality 
being meta is seen as advantageous to effective speaking the metaspeaker simply says whatever they think or want to 
true as if it were true come to think of it this really is nothing new is it once 
i for one believe emphasis must be placed on our propensities which can and do change regarding the very 
subject matter based on setting or circumstance to receive the specific content speech action or plain action without comment 
further action even though we are sometimes highly unsatisfied with it i do not believe that we can account 
the peculiar frustration that attaches to the idea of bullshit without bringing this aspect to the fore which harry 
simply did not do and which the suggestion of here interesting though it is like bold postulation recapitulates não
