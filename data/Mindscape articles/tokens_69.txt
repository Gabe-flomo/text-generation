mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and those of you been following my stuff over the years know that 
interested in quantum mechanics the foundations of quantum mechanics and what it all means and in particular a proponent 
advocate for the manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics i think probably the right one but there are smart people 
disagree so therefore on episode gonna feature a smart person who disagrees david albert is a philosopher of physics 
columbia university he got his phd in physics from rockefeller and he is one of the leading figures in 
world on the foundations of quantum mechanics he is not a fan of manyworlds of what we call everettian 
theory and so gonna dig into what makes him such a skeptic sadly we get quite enough time to 
about what issues what approaches to quantum mechanics he is in favor of but okay maybe come back for 
new podcast some other time sc gonna explain what quantum mechanics is what the measurement problem is what the 
theory says and the particular puzzles he sees that he does not feel optimistic that manyworlds is going to 
able to answer this is a very useful podcast to listen to if interested in this area but an 
both because we sort of clear up what are the silly objections to manyworlds and focus on what we 
are the important puzzles the important challenges to manyworlds david knows perfectly well that manyworlds is a plausible theory 
he just thinks that the obstacles to getting it right are not going to be solved whereas i think 
they are going to be the other reason is because this is a masterclass in careful philosophical reasoning david 
extremely good about not using any jargon either physics jargon or philosophy jargon but also very good at very 
precisely rigorously setting out what the issues are looking at the different alternatives so i personally do not reach 
same conclusions from that analysis that david does but i always have time to listen to him in fact 
actually got a couple of new ideas just while we had this conversation so i hope that you get 
new ideas too sc let me just mention the occasional podcast notes you are very welcome and encouraged to 
mindscape by donating on patreon or paypal you can check out the website preposterousuniversecompodcasts to figure out how to 
that and of course love to get good reviews on itunes or elsewhere and with that go music sc 
albert welcome to the mindscape podcast david albert glad to be here sc and warn listeners ahead of time 
here in your apartment in manhattan and we have a guest speaker in the form of leroy the little 
so if anyone hears barks fear for our safety all part of the experience so start with an amusing 
which i read in adam book about you and by the way writing my own book on quantum mechanic 
my listeners know da so you have told me sc and gonna rewrite that anecdote gonna be no good 
about your experience as a graduate student at rockefeller and you made the mistake of reading a book by 
hume i understand correctly and that got you interested in foundations and what happened da well that received warmly 
rockefeller sc this was in the physics department da this was in the physics department at rockefeller there were 
fairly short order proceedings instituted to expel me from the phd program this was back in the late very 
early so this was in dark old days but worrying about issues like that was profoundly unpopular i got 
stay in the program on the condition that i would work on a thesis topic assigned to me by 
department instead of one that i chose and the one that was assigned was clearly one that was thought 
be good for my character sc well it turned out okay your character is still good today da it 
an extremely calculation heavy it was something about borel resummation and flight of the fourth field theories which people 
playing around with in those days it was an extremely computationheavy thesis topic i had been in contact at 
time already with yakir aharonov who i had written to while i was a graduate student telling him some 
that i was struggling with and know what to do with i asked for his advice he was wonderful 
i did go to him i was given a pretty stark choice at a meeting in the office that 
i was gonna do a thesis topic assigned to me by the department or i was gonna leave the 
program da and i said could i have a couple of days to think this and got in touch 
aharonov who was very nice and had been very close at the time for example to leonard susskind and 
said could talk to lenny maybe we could transfer you i guess he was at stanford at that time 
transfer you to stanford or something like but he said know what take you two years to complete this 
maybe the best thing to do is put your head down go through it i can promise you that 
you a postdoc with me in tel aviv when you get out and you know you go to another 
a lot of respect since be starting all over do so i think that was good advice and i 
it a nice little anecdote i know if in the other book i was of course the whole time 
internally chuckle da and when i finally submitted the thesis actually there are two nice stories about this is 
you have sc please go ahead we like stories those are good da so one story is that is 
epigram to the thesis when i finally submitted it a quotation perhaps apocryphal from galileo to the effect that 
he was finally released by the vatican inquisition he stamped his foot on the ground after having recanted his 
that the earth moves he walked out of the vatican and stamped his foot on the ground and said 
think this is the correct italian said pur si muove it moves it matter what i said it moves 
i chose that quote in italian as the epigram for my thesis it took the department a couple of 
to figure out what it meant and there was widespread offense and people were upset da the other nicer 
is so i submitted my thesis and as you know when you do a defense people just to sort 
show that read the thesis people never pass you completely outright they say minor modifications grammatical this or that 
minor modifications we pass and you should submit the thesis to the office within a week or so so 
walked out of that defense in a mood of the form not spending once more second of my life 
at this thesis or humoring these so i so i never handed in the final copy of my thesis 
the office this was in and for years afterwards there was a vague fear in the back of my 
that somehow i fulfilled the full technical obligations for the phd and somehow some day god was gonna use 
to punish me okay da so sure enough ten years later in i get a call from the librarian 
rockefeller university who says know at the end of each decade we compile all the theses completed over the 
of that decade into a bound volume and so on and so forth and we find that we have 
final copy of your this was the call i had been having nightmares about for ten years and i 
in complete panic collected myself a little bit and did something uncharacteristically bold bold and sort of ballsy for 
so i collect myself and i say you lost what is your job anyway besides keeping track of things 
is outrageous this is unbelievable i think this is appalling no not gonna give you my final copy of 
thesis you had better turn that library upside down and find that thesis and i want a report within 
week back from you about what your progress has been in finding the the woman says sorry absolutely gets 
the phone calls me back a week later and tells me they found it chuckle da and needless to 
she was referring to an item which i happen to know did not exist sc and yet da and 
so a nice story about my getting my phd sc and not as if you were just rambling on 
the time about what could quantum mechanics mean aharonov and you wrote some very nice papers at that time 
thank you sc they were useful for physicists as well da yeah yeah no i thought i had a 
collaboration after that for several years in israel with aharonov and just learned an enormous amount from him i 
that ever met and this is different from an intuition for how to solve foundational problems i know that 
met anyone in my life who had as quick and as sure an intuitive grasp which is almost a 
in term s about how quantum mechanical systems are going to behave and it was just amazing and be 
in his office he liked always to be talking to people how he worked so we were a couple 
his graduate students and postdocs were just sitting around in his office in tel aviv all day and discussing 
again he so focused on what i would now call philosophical problems but he just had this intuition about 
you could make quantum mechanical systems do astonishing things there were stories about him when he used to be 
yeshiva university in new york where he would walk into offices in the philosophy department just in order to 
something to do that evening and say a physical effect which is obviously chuckle da so people would say 
a man turns into an elephant or and aharonov would go home and figure out a quantum mechanical way 
this could happen and this was the kind of exercise that lay behind many things that he discovered and 
and again we would be talking about some concrete physical example and he would say gonna do and you 
say do you know can you he says home and do the calculation obviously gonna do this i know 
to explain and you would go home and do the calculation and be right it was astounding it was 
of these frustrating things also because you figure if looking right at him while doing it gonna see how 
does it chuckle da and it turn out to be true sc no not really turning out to be 
yeah i had richard old desk at caltech and i tried to hide blank pieces of paper on the 
hoping that appear to make sense covered with equations worked either laughter sc so the problem that got you 
this path then presumably before this moment you were a more or less conventional theoretical physics graduate student da 
think right fair to say that my interests were always in a foundational direction i think i well maybe 
long a story laughter da to a first approximation yes sc yes okay but then you discovered that this 
you started thinking that the measurement problem of quantum mechanics really deserved more scrutiny da or i mean i 
sure many people went through this this is nothing extraordinary about me i heard of the measurement problem and 
often ask me to reconstruct how exactly did you get from reading hume to the measurement problem and frankly 
able to reconstruct that and it probably involves an embarrassingly bad misreading of hume sc of hume yeah he 
was not worried about the measurement problem in quantum mechanics da right but somehow in the course of a 
night of great intellectual excitement that began by reading hume by the time the sun was coming up i 
understood that there was a that there was a problem sc so how would for our listeners who are 
physicists or philosophers how would you say briefly what the measurement problem is da something like this if i 
how i know a glass on the table in front of us people are gonna give an account something 
this light in the room and some of the light reflects off the surface of the glass and some 
that reflected light enters my eye and impacts my retina and causes certain kinds of electrical excitations there which 
turn cause electrical excitations in my optic nerve and deeper into my brain and yada yada yada and after 
many steps such steps my brain has entered the state associated with the perception of a glass on the 
i think fair to say that although we know yet or might not have known at the time what 
detailed physical laws were governing all those steps the story had better end up going something like that because 
imagine how else it might go and important that at the end of the day we can convince ourselves 
each of those steps occurs in full accord with whatever the fundamental physical laws are and pretty easy to 
once you start thinking about it from the right angle that this be the correct account of how we 
about the outcomes of certain experiments on quantum mechanical systems da if we were to play the game of 
that the whole world is governed by quantum mechanical laws at a fundamental level then it turns out to 
pretty easy to show and listeners might find it surprising that this is easy to show because thoughts may 
like god but a measuring device or a brain is something a collection of trillions of elementary particles you 
have solved the equations of motions with all now it turns out that we need to aware of a 
mathematical property of those equations called linearity which makes it easy for us to say given that i have 
device here which would end up registering a blip over there if there was a blip over there and 
would end up registering a blip over there if there was a blip over there then we have a 
of calculating pretty straightforwardly what it would do in other circumstances so very briefly in quantum mechanics or at 
on the standard way of thinking about quantum mechanics material particles like electrons for example can be in familiar 
say where located at point a and other familiar situations where located at point b da but they can 
be in other situations in which there are all kinds of compelling experimental reasons to believe that the appropriate 
of describing them would be nothing like that that in a situation in which asking about the spatial location 
the electron would be analogous to asking about the marital status of the number or about the length in 
of catholicism or something like that something that philosophers sometimes refer to as a category mistake that the electron 
be in a situation where it just make sense even to raise questions about where it was located not 
located in some position or other but we know which one but like i say not what you would 
about the marital status of the number that i know what it is sc not our ignorance da there 
no fact about the marital status of the number sc good da and it turns out that you can 
that what the quantum mechanical equations of motion entail if they applied to everything not merely the electron whose 
measuring but the measuring device and your brain when you look at the measuring device and so on suggests 
if you were to interact with this electron with a device designed to measure its position the way things 
end up would be in a situation where there fails to be a fact of the matter about the 
in which the pointer is pointing there fails to be a fact of the matter about whether in a 
state that sees the pointer pointing this way or that sees the pointer pointing that way and the idea 
that these results these implications of the equations of motion seem to be as directly at odds as anything 
imaginably be with our empirical experience of the world sc and just to connect with because i think some 
probably have a little bit of exposure to these ideas making the point that no such thing as the 
of the electron in these states what we often say is that the electron is in a superposition of 
locations da correct exactly right sc and so we help but were we to naively follow the rules of 
mechanics end up in a superposition of brain state da right what i sometimes say to students is that 
the linearity of the quantum mechanical equations of motion entail is that this condition of being superposed in this 
turns out to be fantastically infectious you touch it and got it too okay right right sc and yet 
never feel like in a superposition in some sense so one way of saying the measurement problem i guess 
da right or a stronger way of saying it although of course i know anticipating things to come in 
it the way you did but the initial reaction was more like not just that we feel that obvious 
not the state in sc right it happen yeah da okay obvious that it happen we are as sure 
that happen as we are of anything what happens in the laboratory is that we go and look at 
pointers and we end up with a perfectly determinant belief about where the pointer is pointing in situations like 
which belief we end up with is usually a matter of chance either here or there the trouble is 
what the quantum mechanical equations of motion predict is first of all that no chance at all that the 
of the world is completely deterministic and second of all that the state that you deterministically end up in 
one in which there emphatically fails to be a fact of the matter about which way the pointer is 
or about which way you think the pointer is pointing and as i said the usual reaction to this 
not funny not the way we usually feel it was stronger than this is obviously false sc yeah but 
fact it was so obviously false that the idea of simply taking seriously the quantum mechanical equations the schrödinger 
never occurred to the inventors of quantum mechanics right so the debates between einstein and bohr and others back 
the and and so on led to this additional set of rules which we now call the copenhagen interpretation 
are your thoughts on the copenhagen interpretation we should say what it is wave functions collapse etcetera right da 
the first thing to say about it and one of the many virtues of the book by adam becker 
you mentioned earlier is that he points out that as a historical matter the words really refer to any 
internally coherent set of claims different people claim to be enunciating the copenhagen interpretation when they were actually saying 
different things but yeah the thing you referred to i think fair to say is the thing that was 
there once all the dust settled after many years and a claim like this that gee if you really 
the bullet here what gotta say is that apparently there are two fundamental laws of the evolution of the 
state of the world one of which the one that sort of has sovereignty over the world in those 
when a measurement is not going on are these linear equations of motion and the other which is in 
when measurements are going on is something called the collapse postulate which selects out one or the other of 
possibilities for you makes it the case that when you measure the position of an electron which is in 
superposition of being at x and y the measurement sort of has two steps the idea of its being 
passive thing vanishes forever from physics da step one although these things that occur at two different times but 
conceptual steps step one is it changes the situation of the electron from one in which there is no 
about where it is two one in which there is a fact about where it is and then reports 
you what that fact is the minute this was proposed it was obviously wildly inadequate or at least fell 
short of our previous aspirations for physics it involved at the fundamental level an english word okay that things 
differently when a measurement is going on and when a measurement is not going on and it was clear 
this english word or the german word in von book where this was first clearly laid out have anything 
the requisite precision to play that kind of a role in a fundamental physical account of the world so 
minute this was proposed and i know what it was exactly in von mind but the minute it was 
it was obviously some kind of bad joke or it was something that demanded it was a provisional placeholder 
of thing that demanded much much more elaboration astonishing is that for i think fair to say so von 
was written i think at the very beginning of the sc yeah i think you know da for the 
half century the way that thought about this subject preceded was by people going in what they should have 
from the beginning were ridiculous circles so people would propose a project grew up of locating exactly being able 
delineate exactly the location of the boundary between that set of circumstances where one of these laws applied and 
set where other of the laws applied so words like were replaced by other words like or or an 
recording or subject and object or something like that and these were everybody should have realized within two seconds 
there was no improvement going on here at all that all of these words were equally vague sc but 
these words were invoked by at best of minority of working physicists most working da just care at all 
even da right right sc are very happy to just stick with that chance da i think there may 
been a symbiosis there it gave the business of speculating about this a welldeserved bad reputation i mean perhaps 
most famous of these speculations was one due to wigner who was of course a very prominent and wellknown 
of the first half of the century the person widely credited with introducing group theory into physics and thinking 
symmetries in a certain way into physics and so on nobel prize winner so on and so forth thought 
the way to draw the line between these two domains of situations in the world was dependent on whether 
not they involved conscious systems indeed an essay that listeners might be interested to look at a famous essay 
wigner is called the mindbody problem where thrilled about this idea for the following reason da been thought for 
long time that the picture of the world we get from physics is hostile to certain ideas we have 
ourselves as agents and as thinkers no room in this picture for mind no room in this picture for 
or freedom so on and so forth wigner thought wigner had this idea that it was precisely conscious agency 
caused departures from the standard quantum mechanical equations of motion that caused the collapse of the wave function indeed 
thought there was in this a new definition of the difference between animate and inanimate physical objects what you 
by an inanimate physical object is precisely one that evolves according to the standard quantum mechanical equations of motion 
animate ones are ones that that can give rise to collapses of the wave function and wigner thought this 
great because physics had for so long seemed hostile to the idea of a nonphysical mind somewhere in the 
it turns out so he thought not only is it not hostile it requires such a thing in order 
do its ordinary physical job da good obviously this distinction between animate and inanimate is just as vague as 
else i remember i swear on anything you want me to swear on that as a graduate student i 
wigner at a conference in response to a question speculating to the effect that he thought dogs could likely 
wave functions but mice probably not and you just you sit there and you say is not good okay 
is not the way to do so it remained in that kind of terrible state for about forty years 
the sc sorry to be superduper fair since in a few minutes gonna be advocating that every time we 
a quantum measurement the world splits into multiple copies not the ridiculousness of the claim that worries us so 
as the vagueness of the claim da absolutely right yes i think a good point but the business of 
debates between about dogs versus mice emphasizes just that problem right sc yeah da gee sc why in the 
is that da how are you gonna win that argument right right right i agree with you sc okay 
good da basically for about fifty years after von neumann where things stood during that period there were at 
two what would later be recognized as very important developments one due to everett which you were just referring 
and another due to david bohm which were serious attempts to make sense of this problem but they were 
ignored at the time da then finally also in the early there was a third suggestion due to ghirardi 
and weber which was along the lines of the collapse theory and at that point fair to say there 
to be a critical mass of people talking about this and so on somebody else very much worth mentioning 
belongs mostly to the earlier period is john bell who did take note of work who did take note 
work and i think who is widely thought of nowadays as the person who in contrast to all the 
people we were talking about before wigner and the macroscopic people and the thermodynamic reversibility people bell is widely 
as the person who showed how to think through these questions correctly who established a sort of criterion as 
what kind of thing could even be counted as a potential answer to this problem and what and how 
would begin to evaluate them relative to one another he really set the field in a kind of order 
i think that the useful and productive parts of it have been following ever since sc right so we 
the measurement problem this weird thing that if you take the quantum mechanical equations by which equation is the 
obvious version but sort of different ways of writing it if you take those seriously we seem to run 
a conflict with experience with what we see about the world that it says that we should ourselves evolve 
superpositions so mentioned these three different ways of tackling that problem we have to be historical we can be 
do you have a favorite way of introducing the platter of options da oh of introducing the platter yeah 
nicely said in a paper that what the measurement problem shows is that either the schrödinger equation everything or 
right okay now your favorite interpretation is gonna deny both of those but this is a good way to 
to understand going on the thought was either we need so there was this way this standard way of 
states of quantum mechanical systems that came along with quantum mechanics quantum mechanical wave function or the quantum mechanical 
vector that vector unambiguously ends up a certain way at the end of the measurement process and it ends 
in a way that contain information about what the result of the measurement was and indeed on the standard 
of interpreting it denied that there was a fact about what the outcome of the measurement was da bell 
there are two ways i can imagine dealing with this one change the equations change the equations such that 
do evolve this wave function or state vector in such a way that it ends up associated with one 
another particular outcome of this indeed among the things you would have to change about the laws of evolution 
that they presumably no longer be deterministic now gonna be stochastic because our experience is that sometimes you get 
result and sometimes you get that one strategy referred to as writing down a theory of the collapse of 
wave function this is the strategy most continuous with the kind of thing that von neumann was originally imagining 
and this parenthetically even though it get that much attention among philosophers of foundations roger efforts are in this 
right an explicit theory of the collapse of the wave function da correct we might talk later i think 
were reasons why strategy is probably better than strategy sc so grw being three guys who have a different 
of the collapse of the wave function da correct correct but right is another theory in this family or 
this tradition so tradition number one tradition number two is to take the other horn of the dilemma that 
spells out it might be that the standard laws of the evolution of this quantum mechanical wave function that 
have are perfectly true but the wave function itself might not amount to a complete description of the physical 
you have to add other variables these variables for unfortunate historical reasons were called hidden variables but if you 
something like theory the opposite of hidden they are the thing you see right sc and einstein had sympathies 
this direction da yes he did right right what he seemed to want and what the epr paradox appears 
be an argument for and most people would say that the best example we currently have of a theory 
those lines although also there there are several is one due to david bohm in the there is a 
mean the story as you hinted at and i wanna get too sidetracked here of the way this work 
ignored and the mechanisms that allowed the theoretical physics community to ignore them are sad and in many ways 
in the case of bohm in particular one of the things that allowed people to ignore his work was 
work of the mccarthy committee in the he was harassed out of the country soon after publishing his theory 
was something that made it much easier to ignore his work da often thought somebody like becker begins to 
a stab at this often thought that if you were to trace the sort of history of reactions to 
problems of quantum mechanics get a whole underground history of the century and all kinds of forces come into 
mccarthyism comes into it in russia dialectical materialism comes into it the rise of modernism in the beginning of 
century comes into it it would be a very interesting story to trace out in detail but anyway a 
issue then there is this other more radical more heroic more exciting tradition of everett which wants sc the 
horn of the dilemma da the third horn of the dilemma which bell anticipate in the description i just 
to where gonna insist the quantum mechanical wave function is a complete description of nature and moreover the standard 
quantum mechanical equations of motion without the collapse are always how do we wanna put this bell excuse me 
bell everett suggested in his paper and the paper is at a couple of points crucially unclear this was 
not fault but the fault of his very unresponsible in this case thesis advisor john wheeler who muddied and 
point all over the place because he was afraid of reaction indeed there are i just recently read book 
referring to it a lot there are astonishing letters in book that never seen before of bohr of wheeler 
to sort of assure bohr that everett really criticizing him that could have been listed out of a soviet 
trial just mindboggling sc yeah there are two things that struck me i read book and many other things 
writing my own book and so everett was a graduate student of john wheeler and wheeler himself had worked 
he the student though but had been advised and mentored by niels bohr who was the granddaddy of the 
interpretation and one like you say is that the reaction was both from wheeler who was afraid i know 
afraid is the right word but certainly reluctant in a very explicit way of crossing bohr and everyone else 
the copenhagen but also the many letters that came back and forth from acolytes in copenhagen some of them 
to everett and just being so dismissive and so misunderstanding and you feel bad for everett but the other 
is that everett is someone who made this contribution as a graduate student and then left the field and 
other things times in physics when someone does something great because they were in the right place at the 
time not necessarily they were the smartest person around da right sc but you read what writing was the 
person around da yeah true sc he understood all of the implications of what he was saying da i 
right sc and he left academia he wanted to leave academia as far as i can tell da i 
right the flip side of this there is this horror of the way bohr ruled things the flip i 
say one of the people if i could pick to meet a historical figure because he must have been 
most somehow the most charismatic human being in the history of the world chuckle da and there was just 
long string of brilliant people who would spend an hour with bohr their entire lives would be changed and 
of the ways in which their lives were changed is that they were spouting gibberish that was completely beneath 
about the foundations of quantum mechanics for the rest of their lives and you wanna know how did this 
do this sc and they revered him a quote from wheeler saying thing that made me convinced that there 
people like jesus and moses and buddha was meeting niels da just boy do i wanna meet this guy 
sc because it come across in his writing da it come across in his writing at all at all 
usually advertised as the most detailed and elaborate and sustained statement of view is his response to the epr 
and anybody tried to read this just really hard to see going on i know if heard this story 
a couple of years ago shelly goldstein happened to discover i can see by your face that you know 
story this is an amazing story that the standard version of response to the epr the one that was 
exclusively the template for every reprinting it reprinting of it over a period of about fifty years had two 
the pages reversed chuckle sc i did not know that da and nobody ever noticed this okay so you 
anybody my age your age probably a little less has had a long history of the minute you bring 
a worry about the foundations of quantum mechanics people say do i have to waste my time bohr settled 
sc bohr figured it out da long time and you say to them could you tell me what he 
they say go read the okay chuckle da and obvious that none of the people who were saying this 
read the paper okay sc right yeah da just mindboggling sc okay yeah and a whole bunch of other 
we encourage people to read adam book have adam on the podcast at some point a fascinating history of 
foundations of quantum mechanics which is an under studied field so do everett first because my favorite so what 
solution to the measurement problem da so the way that quantum mechanics mathematically depicts these states of an electron 
example in which there fails to be any fact of the matter about whether located at a or located 
b is by means of an addition of two vectors the superposition of being at a and b is 
by the state vector associated with being at point a plus the state vector associated with being at point 
and the kind of state that the equations of motion predict that gonna be in at the end of 
of these measurement processes looks like a state in which the electron is a and the measuring device registers 
to be a and the sentient observer sees it to be a plus the state where at b and 
measuring device registers it to be at b and the observer sees it at b sc and this is 
nice way to put it because it really drives home the difference with classical mechanics right in classical mechanics 
electron can be at a or be at b no such thing as being at a plus b da 
sc just not a thing in quantum mechanics you can take any two states and add that da absolutely 
right sc and be in the superposition da and be in some distinct physical state that has its own 
physical properties so idea was to interpret the kind of state that i was just describing speaking crudely and 
was more careful than this but we want to be a little fast here as one in which there 
two observers or two experiences of the world being depicted in one of which there is a particle at 
and there is a measuring device that registers it to be at a and an observer who sees it 
a and then the other of which there is a particle at b and a measuring device that registers 
to be at b and an observer who sees it to be at b or who knows it to 
at b and that in some sense there were really two things there there are as it were two 
coherent stories or worlds going on there and it follows immediately that of course we be aware of this 
of splitting because our mental state is either seeing it at a and not at b or seeing it 
b and not at a da so idea was maybe there is a way to take exactly what the 
quantum mechanical formalism had always said literally maybe the arguments that we were referring to before to the effect 
we know this not to be what happens at the conclusion of the measurement process is wrong everett often 
it in what i always thought was a very nice metaphor with consequences of newtonian mechanics okay and newtonian 
has what seems at first like the very counterintuitive prediction that the earth is in motion that moving very 
and one would tend to object at first impossible we would fall so on and so forth sc we 
feel it da right and i know what the history is but newtonian mechanics has the resources to respond 
that by saying you worked out the problem to the end it turns out that the very same laws 
predict that the earth is in motion predict also that if that were true you would think it okay 
that were true you feel it and something very much like that is being done with the linearity of 
quantum mechanical equations of motion in the case of everett this same linearity that leads to this very puzzling 
apparently false prediction of superposition okay also predicts that if that were what was going on you know it 
would think otherwise da you would as a matter of physics as a matter of your physical behavior you 
testify to the contrary if you were interviewed about it so there is a sort of very exciting very 
very an early fan of everett was sidney coleman at harvard who used to go around giving a lecture 
i thought was very aptly named about everett it was called quantum mechanics in your face and the idea 
no no it need to be prettied up or uglied up or something like that it need to be 
up or modified take the thing completely at face value but calm down and interpret it carefully and precisely 
see that what depicting see a way of locating in it exactly your empirical experience in the world sc 
put aside we can talk about the manyworlds interpretation for hours but i wanna skip over the boring parts 
are what i consider to be hilariously unconvincing objections to the everett interpretation like just like all those kinds 
things and also what da do you have objections like that the field for laughter sc a lot of 
that are gonna be flying in your face or your intuition there are also what i take to be 
arguments for everett a sales pitch that i like to give take both of those into as if they 
on the table and move on because i think that your attitude is you object to everett in the 
way you object to copenhagen just vague and illdefined you just think it quite works da yeah right right 
mean basically look preparatory to this i wanna even though it might enhance the excitement of the podcast i 
be more dogmatic here than i actually feel sc oh no right you are not playing a role just 
the truth da right right so that having been said let me say what i take the situation to 
a very obvious puzzle about everett which goes like which can be brought up very easily although when you 
to precisify it it gets complicated in all kinds of interesting ways but crudely speaking you say look quantum 
as usually formulated is a chancy theory a probabilistic theory moreover not merely a sort of curious feature of 
a peripheral feature or an unimportant feature absolutely at its core the reasons we think we have the empirical 
we think we have for believing that quantum mechanics is true have to do with experiments that we repeat 
times and obtain results in terms of large frequencies that we think bear out those probabilistic predictions da those 
predictions and that chanciness is absolutely at the heart of what we take to be our compelling reasons for 
that the theory is true in the first place and the obvious question that comes up right away is 
look if everett is telling us got a way of understanding the deterministic equations of motion to be true 
all circumstances just a very prima facie tension between the claim that the laws of the evolution of the 
are completely deterministic and the appearance of these pervasive chancinesses or probabilities in our experience that on the most 
level as a sort of first pass is puzzling is one of the things puzzling not in terms like 
say of being unexpected or surprising or counterintuitive but on the level of coherence if this theory supposed to 
our experience how does it explain our experience of these chances sc and at the very least both people 
and antieverett agree that the usual way of talking in quantum mechanics that there is a probability of i 
see this spin up be exactly right it might be maybe you talk as if true maybe it gets 
through the day but what actually happens is that with probability you evolve into multiple people da correct correct 
a long history of trying various i think very imaginative ways and ways from which learned a lot about 
question of what probability talk means more generally of trying to come to terms with this there was an 
which is now more or less forgotten but i think was very clever this was certainly for example sidney 
and other attitude that they pointed out that something that was a feature of these deterministic equations of motion 
that if you did an experiment say measuring the zspin of an electron that started out with a definite 
in the x direction and our experience of those measurements is that half the time they come out zspin 
half the time they come out zspin down you just look at the equations of motion how they describe 
situation in which you repeated an experiment like that many many times and it turns out you can prove 
theorem very easily that is the number of times call it n that repeated that experiment goes to infinity 
the world approaches a funny state in which even though there is no fact of the matter about how 
individual one of those experiments came out there was a factor of the and this seems like almost like 
contradiction there is a perfectly definite fact of the matter about the proportion of them that came out up 
the proportion of them that came out down and in the limit is n goes to infinity that proportion 
exactly one half and lots of people were seduced and excited by this result sc did everett himself have 
argument along those lines da i think a like i sc included in da right i something i need 
do and have never done is read all the original everett stuff which is now available although only pretty 
in the published part of his work that argument really clear but i agree with you in your assessment 
brilliance and i would suspect he was aware of that argument and he was just obliged to hide it 
bohr he was too good laughter sc but we have other arguments now people are still trying da right 
anyway that for various reasons work out i guess one of the things to say about it is that 
you actually do get to the limit the theory is adamant that there are no facts about anything okay 
we in fact do infinite numbers of experiments and so on so there were those things since then i 
probably fair to say that in like the late through the early there was less excitement then there is 
about this interpretation and i think a lot of it was due to this difficulty of seeing how you 
make sense of probability talk since then been a very interesting and very lively revival of attempts to make 
out of that probability talk and there are two big traditions that have come up one tradition which is 
with names like david deutsch and david wallace and lots of people around oxford something funny and noticeable about 
of quantum mechanics is that even though all of us grew up with telephones and so on and so 
attitudes about the foundations are incredibly geographically welldefined sc interesting yeah right da and oxford was for many years 
sort of isolated epicenter of sympathy to the everettian view anyway there is a view that goes like this 
start out by saying that is you say to the critics right there are no probabilities here i take 
back you hear me use the word probability anymore they say take it seriously that the only correct thing 
say about gonna happen to you when you make this measurement is that gonna split okay gonna split in 
particular way pose the following question suppose that you knew that what was going to happen to you how 
it be rational for you to behave what kinds of bets would it be rational for you to accept 
decline so on and so forth and these guys claim to have an argument and i think an argument 
work and maybe get a chance to talk about it a little bit but they claim to have an 
that it just so happens that in a world like that the kinds of bets that a rational agent 
accept or decline would just happen to be exactly the same ones that she would accept or decline in 
completely different universe which was chancy okay which had something like the von neumann picture da and so the 
was right there are no chances but the roles the chances actually play in our lives both in our 
lives and in our cognitive lives are more or less exhausted by these claims about which bets we would 
and what got here is a different universe than the one we thought we were in a fully deterministic 
where we know gonna happen but where it just so happens we can show that if you took yourself 
be in a universe like this the kinds of bets you would make the kinds of decisions you would 
about how to behave would be exactly as if you were in a different chancy universe and that match 
that we mean when we say the universe is chancy in a way that it appears to us to 
sc i mean if possible i would love to hear the germ of your objection to this da so 
germ of my objection try to say it achieve some compromise between saying it clearly and saying it concisely 
da and maybe try to say it concisely first and you can make me say it more clearly concisely 
these strategies all these arguments depend so the kinds of things these arguments purport to show is that if 
if you wanna do any kind of decision so a whole branch of logic and mathematics and philosophy called 
theory where people try to sort of axiomatize and lay down clearly what it means to make a rational 
and in order to know what decision you need to make there are you need to decide in advance 
you wish to maximize you may wish to maximize longevity or happiness or profit or something like that but 
a decision about what you wish to maximize and given some picture you have about how the world works 
kinds of what kinds of actions have what kinds of probabilities of leading to what kinds of results an 
that people try to develop in decision theory that you can feed all this into and decide what you 
do sc the axioms seem fairly unobjectionable like if you prefer a to b and b to c you 
prefer a to c right da right so on and so forth a nice old joke which worth bringing 
of sidney who used to be in the philosophy department at columbia sidney said is it that you maximize 
jewish decision answer laughter sc still though fits the axiom laughter da good anyway the thought of these decisiontheoretic 
for everett is as follows we take your preferences for cases where the world is not going to branch 
prefer the outcome to be more money rather than less money for you or something like that and the 
of all the arguments is given your preferences for nonbranching given your preferences among nonbranching futures we can derive 
pain of irrationality what preferences you must have among branching futures okay da so given the amount of money 
willing to pay to make some nonbranching future come true gonna be able to deduce on pain of irrationality 
much money be willing to pay in order to have a certain branching future come true and what they 
to be able to show is that the amount of money you would pay to have this branching future 
true is exactly the amount you would pay to have one branch come true with a certain probability and 
the other branch come true with a certain probability good in a very concise statement of the objection and 
sounds very simple and amazing how long it took for people to see it because the arguments were couched 
a way that made it hard to see da look just nuts to think that your preferences among nonbranching 
could in any way constrain on pain of straightforward irrationality your preferences among branching futures the branching futures are 
whole new set of flavors available to you that become available only once you start considering so for example 
may be somebody who under normal circumstances i know what prefers chocolate ice cream to vanilla ice cream but 
suddenly offered a new ah there can be two of you one of them has chocolate ice cream one 
them has vanilla ice cream you might be you might have a taste for variety or something like that 
is simply not gonna show up in any of your nonbranching preferences okay so there and i think when 
put it this way the whole strategy becomes obviously nuts okay not gonna have on pain of you may 
these tastes are weird and so on not what decision about da like we were saying you can choose 
maximize anything you want profit longevity regret whatever you like okay the decision theory is just supposed to tell 
what supposed to do these guys are arguing that once we know your nonbranching preferences unless completely irrational we 
know your branching preferences sc linearity da that just be right okay that possibly be right because once the 
preferences are put on the table or you can choose among these two you got a whole bunch of 
stuff to choose between the thought was that your preferences among branching cases must somehow leave a trace or 
up among your nonbranching preferences in a way sufficiently strong to fully constrain your preferences among the branching cases 
think this is just wrong okay da let me see if i can give a more concrete example a 
example which people in the decision theoretic tradition use imagine the following kind of superposition you have one hundred 
and the rest of the world is in state a okay and you have one dollars and the rest 
the world is in state b okay imagine a superposition of those two you have one hundred dollars and 
rest of the world is in state a plus you have one dollars and the rest of the world 
in state b good moreover let it be stipulated that among the nonbranching options that is you have one 
dollars or you have you care about the rest of the world you only care about how much money 
have so you have no preferences among you have one hundred dollars and the world is in state a 
you have one hundred dollars and the world is in state b and you have no preferences among you 
one dollars and the world is in state a and you have one dollars and the world is in 
b but you prefer one hundred dollars with a or b any state with one hundred dollars whether the 
of the world is in state a or state b to any state with one dollars and the rest 
the world is in state a or state b good da then they say true now consider the following 
superpositions one hundred dollars and state a plus one dollars and state b and one hundred dollars in state 
plus one dollars in state they say have a preference for one of those over the other because already 
it clear that you care about the difference between a and b what shows up in your nonbranching okay 
yeah kinda makes sense to me i gotta admit that laughter da good good so let me to make 
even more clear let me back up a tiny bit well go through it here and then maybe back 
when we need to right okay yeah okay suppose i say know part of the state of the rest 
the world is in state a fat and in state b okay i care about how fat i am 
is what i mean by i care how fat i am is i have no preferences between one hundred 
and fat and one hundred dollars and thin and i prefer one hundred dollars fat or thin to one 
fat or thin so i have no preferences about my weight but i say confronted with the branching and 
say know i think kinda like to be rich in the branch where fat i think more of me 
gonna be okay or something now we have to have a discussion about how reasonable this sc no you 
think a logical possibility i care whether fat or thin da a logical sc but da right sc conditionalized 
being that i want more money da exactly exactly okay sc or vice versa i guess da it was 
familiar with this example you use this example in some papers of yours for slightly different reasons but everybody 
and it seemed very innocent to say of course not gonna matter if you permute the fat and thin 
told us you care about that they careful to attend to the fact that what they meant by saying 
told us you care about that is that it show up in your nonbranching preferences nothing your having those 
preferences is completely consistent with your having all kinds of different preferences among different kinds of branching that might 
okay so i just and the minute you start to think about it that way it seems to me 
immediately say to yourself god what could we have been of course the branching preference is just a whole 
set of options that you have once those are put on the table what makes you imagine that you 
have deduced as a matter on pain of pure inconsistency your preferences among the branching options just from your 
more limited set of preferences among the highly special nonbranching options so in a nutshell why i think those 
work sc do they have an obvious response to this yet or is it the ongoing dialog da there 
i think fair to say there is an ongoing dialogue and i wanna put words in mouths there are 
other principles that are sometimes cited in decision theories things that go under names like diachronic coherence and so 
and so forth which are sometimes people try to bring to bear in these situations i think beside the 
yeah i say that given up and rolled over although i do think for example david claims about what 
kind of argument establishes are now a little bit more modest than they used to be that clearly showing 
consistency of such a thing but not necessarily the rational necessity of such a thing but i wanna put 
in mouth my impression it has gone back and forth there are attempts to justify some of these principles 
for myself and it took me a while in the evolution of my own thinking about this i had 
of this i had thought of this socalled fatness example early on it took me a while to see 
general point okay the general point i now see is these branching options these nonbranching options are just a 
fraction of the actual options you have once branching is put on the table where did you get the 
that you could infer everything about your preferences among the branching cases from your preferences among the nonbranching sc 
i think read stuff by you about the fatness example but i found it wholly unconvincing but this one 
perfect sense to me that there can just be correlations between preferences that have existed in the nonbranching options 
right right right sc yeah okay da so i think a much cleaner way to make the point and 
you just said this the way i presented it in earlier writings i had very specific examples now it 
a while to understand that these are examples of a very general very simple point and i know if 
point has been made in writing in such a way that really gotten the attention of advocates of this 
of view and maybe just have to wait a little to see how it strikes them sc speaking of 
a little clearly not gonna do justice to grw and bohm da sure sc okay some other day we 
we might as well do justice to everett da sure sc you said another way to get to the 
that you also agree with da sure that there is a and where i wanna be a little less 
i think a pretty cutanddried argument as just been describing against the decisiontheoretic point of view there is a 
of view associated with among other people you about this that been thinking about for much less long because 
proposed more recently and at least at this stage more puzzled about but fair to say that i have 
about it that look to me to be serious so if you want me to describe sc i do 
will chime in da so something like this one of the original ways we had of putting the worry 
look where it is or maybe i put it this way but a way of putting it at this 
of the discussion be useful about to do a measurement of the zspin of an electron whose xspin is 
or about to do a measurement of the position maybe easier to understand of a particle which is being 
which is in at the moment the superposition of being located at x and located at y and we 
if ever it is true i know exactly going to happen there are gonna be two of me one 
them is gonna see the particle at x one of them is gonna see the particle at end of 
everything is deterministic and puzzling about this is as follows if you consider any other circumstances in which we 
it sensible to say things like the probability that x is going to occur or the probability that x 
going to occur or the probability that gonna see x is say da now we have a fully satisfactory 
on a correct philosophical analysis of chance but sure as hell whatever it means one of the things it 
is that something about the future of which not currently certain okay there may be any number of reasons 
my not being certain about this aspect of the future it may be that the fundamental laws of motion 
inherently chancy and for that reason i be certain about the future no matter how much information i may 
about the present or it may be that the laws are perfectly deterministic but some information about the present 
missing because very difficult to obtain because very microscopically detailed or something like that and it may be some 
of those two factors the worry in the everett case is there seems to be nothing relevant to what 
in here about the future when preparing to do this measurement of the position of the particle there seems 
be nothing relevant about the future of which currently ignorant i know exactly gonna happen da there are gonna 
these two guys one will see the particle at x one will see the particle at y end of 
so you say does anything like chance have an opportunity to get a chance requires uncertainty okay remember and 
here to contrast this with the decisiontheoretic strategy the decision theoretic strategy took the following route we agree no 
for chance here no chance here all going on is that the decisions that a rational person is gonna 
would be the same ones they would make under these other circumstances where there is chance so call it 
chance or something like that good another approach somebody says look at this process in a little more detail 
that there is an interval between the measurement actually being carried out and my looking at the measuring da 
i know that the measurement has already been carried out before i look at the measuring device at that 
it seems fair to say i know that now already either in the electron was at point a world 
in the electron that was in point b world but i know which so here it seems as if 
have the sort of thing we wanted we have some genuine uncertainty once got uncertainty about the future that 
i know which one going to see when i look it feels like chance has a chance to get 
foothold in a not incoherent way there are all kinds of questions which we could discuss in more detail 
but who says we always have this interval and in some senses in this interval coming too late too 
in the game put those all aside i think you guys have interesting things to say about all of 
sc us guys the paper i wrote was with chip sebens now my my colleague at caltech in the 
department da right and that sounds more promising this is gonna be a way to get real oldfashioned chance 
in the game in contrast to the decision theoretic strategy sc there is something you know which branch of 
wave function on da right right good what is hard for me to understand about this this comes out 
a tradition of thinking about probabilities epistemically okay of thinking that what probabilities represent our cases of us being 
about something let me think about the right order in which to say stuff here let me say it 
this order so there are a couple of there are a couple of things that i find puzzling piled 
top of each other here the piling makes them that much more puzzling as a collective the first thing 
there is this long tradition of thinking this tradition that goes back to laplace if what i know and 
i know is that either there is a marble in box a or a marble in box b and 
know nothing more that is my epistemic situation with regard to the question the marble in box a or 
is i have no clue da then there is some kind of a priori principle of rationality to the 
that the probability you ought to assign to the marble being in box is and the probability you ought 
assign to its being in box b is this is referred to as a principle of indifference and the 
of it i wanna focus on is not exactly how you do the calculation because you guys are gonna 
different ways of doing it gonna have your esp principle gonna have different ways of doing it there the 
feature of it is that a priori okay that that it enters sc not empirical da right not empirical 
enters in as a principle of rationality and something very confusing to me about a strategy like that there 
that is when people are asked to offer arguments for a strategy like this a fairly straightforward argument look 
certain symmetry in my epistemic situation my epistemic situation distinguish in any way shape or form between box a 
box so when i come to the business of assigning probabilities in order to be faithful in order for 
probabilities to be faithful representations of my epistemic situation they must respect the symmetries that are inherent in my 
situation and there is only one assignment of probabilities that respects those symmetries in a case like this the 
da and it seems to me that reaction to this ought to and then mind you i mean you 
back in the history people use this kind of reasoning to show why the probabilities in classical statistical mechanics 
what they are this turns into an explanation of the fact that heat only flows from hotter bodies to 
bodies and all kinds of stuff like that okay all kinds of claims of gonna happen out there in 
world okay sc i mean it does work da it succeeds right right it succeeds but if this is 
reason why if this is offered as the explanation of why heat is flowing from hotter bodies to cooler 
it seems to me that you have to say on a second i must have dozed off there at 
point something happened that seems kind of i went from have no to course i should expect that heat 
gonna flow from hotter bodies to cooler i know how to assign precise numerical probability values to various different 
you should anybody who hears this should say i win the lottery or something i mean how did i 
all of this for free okay how am i so lucky and why is it that this constitutes an 
of an explanation of physical stuff out there in the world that give a shit what i know or 
acting in some particular okay so you know that always struck me as profoundly mysterious and of course if 
examine the argument a little further that i just offered a bad argument not the only thing i can 
that respects the symmetries of my epistemic situation the other thing i can do which respects those symmetries and 
seems like a much more honest account and direct account of what my epistemic situation in fact is is 
say when asked to assign probabilities to these two possibilities is to say part of i have no clue 
you not understand i have no clue means i have no clue of course not going to assign probabilities 
these two possibilities my epistemic situation is i have no clue period end of now sc if forced to 
a probability distribution you will get that one for da if you mean they force sc kind of da 
hold a gun to my head sc yeah da i mean if somebody held a gun to my sc 
are saying another option da no not if somebody held a gun through my head it seems to me 
right thing to say to them would be being extremely laughter da this really sc please stop holding a 
to my head da what doing because there is no rational thing for me to say okay now as 
said and this is a really interesting difference between this kind of way of justifying probabilities in something like 
statistical mechanics and this way of justifying probabilities in something like everett or in general what people call selflocating 
in the case of classical statistical mechanics the things attaching probabilities to are different physical configurations of the world 
as you correctly said just now those numerical assignments of probability turn out to be empirically correct okay so 
that requires alteration in our attitude towards statistical mechanics if you were to buy my argument okay is if 
were to buy my i have no clue argument is just that right these probabilities a the world doing 
because i because i had no clue these probabilities turn out to be empirically correct as you said and 
somebody says kind of status do you think they it seems to me the correct answer is they have 
status of statistical empirical laws of how the world is arranged okay and we believe them precisely because of 
empirical success sc this is this a reflection of your humean upbringing da i guess i guess yeah yeah 
is it is good when we get so the summary of the discussion of classical statistical mechanics is you 
a mistake here but the mistake in any way cripple your scientific enterprise just there is this probability distribution 
were right about what its numerical values were just that you thought you could derive it a priori and 
turns out not to be true your reasons for believing it are empirical and if somebody says gee it 
so reasonable to the person who has my sort of position will have a ready explanation there look these 
true statistical laws and very general ones every reason to expect them to have been very deeply hardwired into 
since we were fish okay by natural selection that in any way put in doubt the claim that they 
ultimately empirical generalizations although they may seem to us extremely intuitive and exactly what we would expect and so 
okay sc and you think that that explanation is available for everettians da so the difference in the everettian 
not talk right away about everett just talk about the more general notion of selflocating probabilities so an old 
due to david lewis imagine that there are two brains in the world at a certain moment in its 
imagine that at that moment these two brains are in exactly the same state okay and sc except located 
two different places da located in two different places right in exactly the same state that is vis a 
their associated mental state right they may even have two different bodies or something like that but their current 
state is exactly the same suppose moreover that part of this mental state that they share that they know 
are these two things in the world then lewis says of them could rightly wonder wonder if the one 
the right or on the okay even though nothing about the physical state of the world that they know 
so there could be another kind of uncertainty unlike the one we were discussing before in the context of 
mechanics not an uncertainty not anything that you lack knowledge of about the objective physical state of the world 
that is compatible a kind of uncertainty compatible with complete knowledge of the physical state of the world just 
you have in everett in the context been discussing but still something you know about where you are in 
da okay and suppose that we were to start a indifference type of argument here come up with a 
principles about what kinds of probabilities we should assign here the case is crucially different than in the earlier 
mechanical case in the earlier statistical mechanical case the lucky thing was you philosophers you can have all the 
you like it matter because we have empirical access to what the correct probabilities are but if two people 
having a debate about to split one of them says believe gonna end up on the the other says 
gonna end up on the a third says or rather some single person is entertaining three theories according to 
of which they got a chance of ending up on the right according to the second of which they 
a chance of ending up on the left and according to the third of which got chances in this 
since the probabilities do not attach to claims about the physical configuration of the world there gonna be an 
access to them okay sc thinking of these choices as actually arising from a quantum measurement branching the wave 
da yeah yeah suppose sc so again with probability both really do come true somewhere in the wave da 
correct both really do come true but now assigning different probabilities to our finding ourselves in one branch or 
other here as opposed to the classical statistic mechanical case what assigning probabilities to have the form of a 
configuration of the world all the different theories completely agree about the physical configuration of the world just disagreeing 
where gonna find myself in there because not disagreeing about the physical configuration of the world obvious that you 
up an experiment for example that has the following property if theory one is true the number one ends 
being written on a piece of paper at the end and if theory two is true the number two 
up being written on a piece of paper because what ends up getting written on a piece of paper 
part of the physical configuration of the world gonna be the same under any of these circumstances da so 
gonna have to go on here is the a priori argument and if somebody finds the a priori argument 
then we really that really is gonna cripple our ability to do physics here in a way that it 
the classical statistical mechanical case because not this other non a priori empirical access to what the right probabilities 
you can say we run such an experiment a guy splits once each one splits again each one splits 
da good be one guy who got all the particles on the left be another guy who got all 
particles on the right be a much larger collection of people who found some of the particles on the 
and some of the particles on the right good look at the guy who got them all on the 
he says theory that to the left was very wellconfirmed by what i all the other people suppose he 
talk to them unlike in everett they all start screaming at him are you talking about we confirmed completely 
of course the guy who found them all on the left will say knew as a matter of physical 
that you guys were all gonna be there saying this asking about confirmation or disconfirmation about where i was 
to end okay confirmed on the left da the guy in the right will say the same thing about 
other theory and all the guys in the middle will say the same thing about the theory not gonna 
a definitive way to settle this we might and i think from a conversation you and i had yesterday 
this might be the reaction you would have in mind you say i agree with all the kinds of 
shall i put it the sense in which one of these probabilistic theories is confirmed or disconfirmed by such 
is a purely indexical sense an irreducibly indexical sense that is it is not possible it make any sense 
ask did this sequence of experiments confirm or disconfirm the theory sc universally da right you say that it 
it or that disconfirmed it for i sc i think that an everettian has to say that because there 
be always some real branch of the wave function where everything went for all of history da no no 
true but if for example if the decision theoretic argument had worked which i think it does they have 
to have resource to this new and metaphysically puzzling kind of purely indexical fact okay sc no but i 
that there will always be people who draw the wrong conclusions in an everettian multiverse da sure right okay 
they if they you see gonna get into a circularity here i think fine if there are people who 
their own conclusions as long as the case that one reason or another not to take them seriously okay 
you might wanna say have to take them seriously because sc yeah i was trying to avoid that yeah 
unlikely okay sc clearly cheating da but then gonna get into it right sc clearly cheating da other than 
i mean if you take on board these purely indexical facts i mean i at this point that it 
hard for me to see my way clearly through so talking about some new realm of facts purely indexical 
and i guess gonna wanna know a lot sc just in case not obvious to our audience indexical meaning 
you are in the universe or some fact of location da or put it this way philosophers call statements 
where the meaning of the statement depends on the circumstances under which made okay if i say am wearing 
black true if you say am wearing a black false okay now in most ordinary cases this cause a 
because we can translate the statements using indexicals into statements using nonindexicals we could say no going on here 
that david is wearing a black shirt and sean is and we can get rid of that okay in 
cases talking about the statements concerned with are irreducibly indexical we take the out of it we take the 
terms out while still meaning what we want to mean this sc the only difference is which branch of 
wave function will go da exactly exactly so if we really need to take on board into our metaphysics 
like that in order even to formulate our most basic physical theories a scary and puzzling situation for me 
let me distinguish scary from puzzling maybe scary is too strong a word undesirable just because we have other 
of solving the measurement problem on the table that require us to speculate about these new kinds of facts 
other things being equal which of course you will deny that they are but other things being equal that 
strongly preference the other ones da the second point is just puzzling i need so you know so somebody 
sort of philosophical inclinations is immediately gonna say woah got this whole new set of facts here all kinds 
things i wanna know about how these things work how logically related to one another what combinations of such 
deductively imply other such facts and so on and so forth i wanna know a semantics of this kind 
talk i wanna know a logic of this kind of talk you gotta give me a few days here 
i gotta sit down and think all this so first statement and i and the sense in which i 
be nondogmatic here is i know how that thinking would come out maybe a consistent way to talk about 
that maybe not if not then the view is ruled out in a very decisive way if there is 
it becomes more of a balance between various desiderata we might have sc that scary but exciting and exhilarating 
the same time laughter da oh okay you know cup halffull cup halfempty in my tradition you maximize regret 
sc alright reached our little cut off here so i have not maximized regret this was great thanks david 
being on the podcast da thank you for having me it was lots of fun music i testify that 
would prefer to play everettian quantum russian roulette over noneverettian quantum russian roulette does this qualify as a counter 
the decisiontheoretic argument regardless i hope no one will be putin a gun to my head and forcing me 
play any version of russian roulette reminds me of a video podcast of sean dinner party where they finally 
to test the many interpretation link below if they would have made additional measurements fast enough then it would 
the universes from branching rookie mistake but is the fatastic many interpretation and the copenhagen interpretation crowding out other 
i might as well be debating the existence of heaven and hell there is one rather trivial connection between 
and the measurement problem something along the lines said in a recent comment on sebastian ex guest post on 
blog of course hume is right that justifying induction by its success in the past is circular of course 
is right that describing measurements in terms of unitary quantum mechanics is circular of course poincaré is right that 
the natural numbers as finite strings of digits is circular simplified those subtle philosophical positions to such objectionable short 
this circularity is somehow trivial it really count it does make sense to use induction describing measurement in terms 
unitary quantum mechanics does clarify things and the natural numbers are really well defined but why pingback probability or 
ontic epistemic aleatory subjective personalist bayesian egocentric quantum objective rational inductive existential untrammeled mind pingback sean carrols mindscape podcast 
albert on quantum measurement and the problems with manyworlds three quarks daily the argument with two individuals in exactly 
same brain state toward the end of the podcast is fallacious whether we say there is one individual in 
locations or two identical individuals is meaningless there must be something about objection relating to linear combinations of preferences 
understand if i say i prefer one hundred dollars over with no preference to world a or b i 
simply left out any crosspreference eg in the case where i have one hundred dollars i prefer a to 
and viceversa it that a crosspreference suddenly springs into existence when we consider quantum mechanics just that you forgot 
ask me about that the first time in other words consider two bits that are going to be assigned 
some truly random process i might declare that i prefer the first bit to contain a one and have 
preference for the second if you later tell me that written an algorithm that takes the random input and 
the bits in a way that the outcomes are correlated i might say wait you ask me whether i 
about correlated i certainly say broke it necessary to invoke qubits to recreate example and indeed if you asked 
about by preferences with respect to two qubits they should reduce to some function over the states my future 
would actually observe i will never directly experience a linear combination of states so why would i have a 
about it jeffrey freed not meaningless if one individual is in two locations then that individual has incompatible properties 
of being in location a and not being in location a if two individuals then there are no incompatible 
devin morse what am i missing here a person asks wonder if i will be the one on the 
or the one on the left just after the how can there be a fact of the matter the 
is completely arbitrary since by hypothesis they have exactly the same experience being in precisely the same brain state 
would say there is one person in two locations of course they will develop into different individuals thereafter each 
an equally valid claim to have been the original person before the split so if the distinction cannot be 
that mean that there is no perceptible difference between the branching and the nonbranching scenarios phd dissertation story is 
he worked on his dissertation for a couple of years was asked to make minor revisions as many are 
to do but he refused and was granted the phd anyway my problem with the everettian branch idea say 
to measure a quantum result that has two possible values spin up or spin down according to everett everything 
determined and both outcomes occur also in a determined fashion there are now two of me one for each 
one of me though is different it is the one that am aware of and the one that sees 
up my question what exactly is this or whatever you want to call it that is only aware of 
up if our consciousnesses are strictly emergent features of brain activity what is the difference that causes to be 
of only one branch and what is this that was a great podcast am i an everettian i feel 
one part of me is wow this was an astoundingly good discussion i hope you have him back on 
forward to your book i would argue that if we live in an everettian manyworlds our normal understanding of 
theory and probability theory hold anymore we can not think in terms of probabilities because we can not repeat 
same measurement twice and there is no way of knowing the statistical probability of state a vs state b 
thinking about a binary decision as a worldbranching event there are three people involved the one that not made 
decision yet the one that chose state a and the one that chose state b but there is no 
between the undecided person and person a or b they are completely separate this makes the question the chance 
will be person a or irrelevant an invalid question you could say person a and b both were the 
person but not the other way not sure but i think i share confusion here how could you possibly 
new preferences when offered multiple branches of reality when you are still only going to end up in one 
them the only new fact given me with this new version of reality is that there is another person 
the other state of the universe when the branch happened except i have no interaction whatsoever with that person 
is almost identical to me but nor their universe so it seems strange that my decision making logic would 
to maximize something in that universe too that would be a very esoteric sort of preference how can we 
all this talk about hugh everett without mentioning one of his greatest accolades father of mark everett aka the 
of rock band eels people step outside the lab httpsenwikipediaorgwikimarkolivereverett one of your best podcasts to date this is 
stuff here for but why shouldnt it be possiblemultiple personalities are possible multiple worlda are possiblewe are in the 
fi somewhere else love other poeple communicate with otherspast and present and future are different worldw we seek the 
the equality or the worlds in order to identify ourselves in it in pakistan we want to be and 
like pakistans etc besides the timespace theory can also make a person or its idol exist in tow worlds 
is needed more research david albert says nonbranching options are just a tiny fraction of the actual options you 
once branching is put on the table where did you get the idea that you could infer everything about 
preferences among the branching cases from your preferences among the nonbranching my counter to this is that we are 
deep trouble if our decision theory depends on which interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct wave function collapse produce 
same amount of indeterminacy with respect to whether i am fat or thin that mwi produces why does his 
correlate two outcomes in one theory but not in the other if all four combinations of the two variables 
possible in both the branching and nonbranching options ought to be the same for either theory or else there 
be something more deeply wrong this is a fascinating topic for discussion it seems that there is a rather 
effort to preserve determinism no matter how farfetched the many worlds scenario appears to be if it is true 
quantum effects are the mo of brains then every decision made has two outcomes one in this world and 
opposite in a different world suppose that i stand on a curb at a busy intersection and am tempted 
try to beat the traffic in a rush to the other side i decide that it is too dangerous 
my double in the other universe decides to dash across and is killed does another double appear for the 
decision it seems to me that considering razor the simpler explanation is that the decision i make settles the 
and there is no double in another world why is free will so hard to accept when one looks 
the amount of quantum activity that can take place in the time frame of inflation and hot big bang 
the unsustainable versions of the universe could have appeared and annihilated in the process spinning out this one there 
be no fossils and no multianything leftovers for us to detect thus our is not the anthropic universe it 
the sustainable universe it is darwinian pingback some naive questions about manyworlds quantum mechanics untrammeled mind comments are closed
