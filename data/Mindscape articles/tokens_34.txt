carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and today going to go back 
consciousness not just the easy problem of consciousness how the brain looks at the world and figures out what 
where and how to respond to it but the hard problem of consciousness what makes us who we are 
we experience the world what it is like to be us that inner subjective first person view that we 
of reality sc now if been following me for a while you know that a naturalist a physicalist in 
which means i think the world is made of stuff obeying the laws of physics and basically it except 
that stuff comes together to form complicated things like human beings there can be new emergent phenomena that arise 
consciousness is one of those consciousness is just an aspect of the collective action of underlying stuff obeying the 
of physics but you will not be surprised to learn that there are those who disagree and those who 
need not be hardcore cartesian dualists they necessarily think that a disembodied mind that somehow interacts with the body 
it can also be true that you believe the world is made of physical stuff but the physical stuff 
extra properties mental properties and this point of view drives you in the direction of panpsychism thinking that everything 
a little bit conscious not just that something new happens when atoms and particles come together to form a 
but there was something that was there all along and it becomes important and noticeable once you get something 
an organism or a brain so for guest we have philip goff a professor of philosophy at durham university 
the uk and one of the leading thinkers on panpsychism he is all for it i am against it 
we have a very nice conversation sc philip is the author of an academic book called consciousness and fundamental 
and also a brand new just published popular level book called error foundations for a new science of consciousness 
i have fun in the podcast with the idea that on side and philip is against galileo side but 
philip is also pro galileo he thinks that galileo made a mistake in overly mathematizing the world that we 
in that a qualitative aspect to the world as well as a quantitative aspect so you can listen to 
we say back and forth about both sides of this mostly as usual i give philip a chance to 
his sales pitch for his side but you can tell where my sympathies lie sc remember that if you

podcast we always like that and with that go music sc philip goff welcome to the mindscape podcast philip 
thank you very much good to be here thanks for having me sc very excited for this podcast because 
not completely sure but i think this is the podcast on which the guest and i disagree most strongly 
most of the important things be talking about but in a productive way and i really i read you 
a new book coming out i read the book and a fantastic book very very clear statement of the 
that you want to make and that case of course is for a panpsychist view of consciousness so why 
had i had a previous interview with david chalmers and so some of the podcast listeners will have heard 
but not all of them so not assume they know anything why you tell us why a problem with 
what it is that trying to figure out when we talk about consciousness pg sure well a big discussion 
i think the core of the problem is that physical science works with a purely quantitative vocabulary whereas consciousness 
an essentially qualitative phenomenon just in the sense that it involves qualities the redness of a red experience the 
of coffee the taste of mint and you capture it seems these qualities in the purely quantitative vocabulary of 
science you capture in the quantitative language of neuroscience the redness of a red experience and so it looks 
as long as your description of the brain is framed in a purely quantitative vocabulary it seems that going 
miss out these qualities of consciousness and thereby miss out an essential component of consciousness so the way i 
to frame the starting point of the philosophical problem this clash between the quantities and qualities the quantities of 
science and the qualities we know from our own first person conscious experience sc so for people who do 
a little bit about the issue interested here in the hard problem of consciousness that first person subjective experience 
so in the easy problems about how people behave and how we treat them as conscious creatures how they 
the world and things like that pg yeah i mean look all sorts of very important things we can 
with neuroscience and neuroscience is absolutely essential for making progress on consciousness a big fan of neuroscience and i 
to keep as up to date as i can but i think another way of putting what neuroscience gives 
are correlations between brain activity and conscious experience so you can scan brains you can ask them what thinking 
feeling and you can get that rich body of correlation between certain kinds of brain activity and certain kinds 
conscious experience but that in itself is not the full story because if we want a complete theory of 
if we want if you like to move to solving the hard problem we want to explain those correlations 
want to say is it why is it when you have such and such brain activity you have feeling 
hunger or pg and because of the purely quantitative vocabulary of physical science hard to see how you can 
any such explanation so yeah the starting point my starting point is we know that consciousness is real nothing 
more evident than the reality of our feelings and experiences so we have to find some way of integrating 
into our scientific story but we and we can build correlations and fine and important but to give a 
of deeper explanation we come up against this difficulty of the essential qualitative nature of consciousness and the quantitative 
of physical science so yeah the challenge sc yeah and just a preview a little bit sure get into 
in more detail but my point of view the point of view of someone like me which label the 
point of view going forward is that in some very real sense there is literally nothing else to say 
said what all of the physical stuff in the universe does right that what we do when we talk 
consciousness or even feelings of experiences and so forth is simply come up with a convenient label for a 
level emergent phenomenon that is ultimately nothing more than physical stuff doing things sc and i think and this 
really where david i guess and i talked about this a little bit but i think this is where 
conversation is going to be very very useful and digging into what exactly is meant by that distinction like 
it is or it can be a complete explanation just to say what stuff does pg yeah and i 
a coherent position you just described and i read some of your most recent book yeah and i was 
to say that i was actually struck at how detailed you go into these contemporary philosophical discussions everything is 
specialized these days hard to learn jealous of people in the century where you kind of know everything chuckle 
sc i know sure they complained too but you chuckle pg but yeah you put quite a lot of 
into the details of these contemporary philosophical discussions yeah i think a coherent position you describe but i suppose 
going to defend that so maybe why i probably set things up in the way dave chalmers does been 
hugely important influential way of setting things up but you might think sort of already assuming what trying to 
that neuroscience can just give us the easy problems then this hard problem whereas you might say see why 
but so what i would say is okay fine a coherent position just described and that would solve the 
if it made sense but i think you then have an extra explanatory obligation right pg got i would 
maybe you disagree i would say that we know from our first person perspective from our immediate awareness of 
own feelings and experiences we know that consciousness has this qualitative nature it involves these qualities the redness of 
experience and so on and i think if going to be a materialist then you owe us an explanation 
how that is accounted for in the terms of physical science how can you account for those qualities in 
purely quantitative language of physical science pg you owe us an explanation perhaps something like the explanation of the 
point of water we can give in terms of chemistry so i think at least an explanatory obligation there 
the materialist before we can say that makes sc yeah i think perfectly fair and biting my tongue because 
want to try to give such an explanation but i will get it later or at least talk about 
later in the podcast build our way up i just wanted to preview for the audience what the stakes 
a little bit you blame galileo for people like me this is a very bold move in the book 
is not one of the people who we regularly bash in pop sci discussion so maybe give the audience 
clue as to what your beef is with galileo pg sure well look a big fan of galileo here 
well being a little bit provocative pg by the way i was just in florence in italy and i 
if ever been there but there is a galileo museum where they keep his middle the bones of his 
finger as almost like a religious relic pg fantastic did you go and pay respect sc i did i 
yeah there was no burning of incense or lighting of candles or anything like that but i did have 
dreger as a podcast guest earlier and she wrote a whole book called middle finger imagining that galileo was 
the middle finger to the rest of the world i think that gesture has the same meaning in italy 
it does here anyway yes we actually want to worship galileo or anybody else so go ahead pg so 
issue with so a key moment in the scientific revolution is declaration that mathematics is to be the language 
the new science so the new science is to have a purely quantitative vocabulary and so this is a 
discussed moment but what is less focused on and what i focus on in my book is the philosophical 
galileo had to do to get to that stage because before galileo people thought the physical world was filled 
qualities pg so there were colors on the surfaces of objects smells floating through the air tastes inside food 
this was a challenge for aspiration to give a completely mathematical description of the physical world because as already 
hard to see how you can capture those kind of qualities in a purely quantitative language how can you 
in an equation the spiciness of paprika so galileo got around this by proposing a radically new philosophical theory 
reality and according to this theory those qualities really out there in the physical world rather in the consciousness 
the observer which crucially galileo took to be outside of the domain of science pg so the redness really 
the surface of the tomato in the consciousness of the person receiving the tomato or the spiciness really inside 
paprika in the consciousness of the person eating it so galileo as it were stripped the world of its 
and after done that all that remained were the purely quantitative features of matter size shape location motion things 
can be captured in mathematical geometry pg so there is this radical division radical dualism in picture between the 
world with its purely quantitative properties which is the domain of science and consciousness with its qualities which is 
of the domain of science so this is the start of mathematical physics which has obviously gone very well 
crucially galileo at least only intended it to be a partial description of reality right the whole project was 
on setting consciousness outside of the domain of science so i think this is really important so generally accepted 
that consciousness does pose a serious scientific problem which is not always the case but a lot of people 
this following reaction they say a serious problem but we just need to do more neuroscience and sort it 
i think the reason they think that is because they look at the great successes of physical science in 
more and more of our universe and they think course one day is going to crack pg but the 
is i would argue that physical science has been so successful precisely because it was designed to ignore consciousness 
was the whole set up so i think if galileo would time travel to the present day and hear 
this hard problem of explaining consciousness in terms of physical science say course you do that i designed physical 
to deal with qualities not sorry other way around designed physical science to deal with quantities not so this 
trying to push here and not really at the stage of arguments a sort of narrative that i as 
philosopher i spend a lot of time on these fiddly arguments and i think important and maybe we can 
some of those but i think really at the end of the day the big picture that grabs people 
the big picture such as you present in your book that look the success of science physical science in 
of course going to explain consciousness one day but i think actually a different way of looking at the 
of science such that that conclusion does not obviously follow in fact probably led in something of the opposite 
so the sc just so people know in yeah your book is entitled error foundations for a new science 
consciousness so happy to take the progalileo point of view for the rest of the podcast while you take 
the plucky underdog there pg well hold on you should be a dualist if going to take the progalileo 
position chuckle sc no just i think that i am what galileo would have evolved into my goal obviously 
lived a long time ago and i really this is jumping ahead once again but i really think that 
consciousness aside i think that it is understanding these quantitative features of the world as ways of talking about 
qualitative features of the world how i would put it but pg if i can sc sure please pg 
am inclined to think i am what galileo would have evolved into because i think galileo took physical science 
seriously but he also took the qualitative reality of consciousness very seriously and i think what eventually get to 
a way of bringing both together and yeah anyway sc from what i know that personality he would not 
been very happy with a book called error pg true true fair enough fair enough sc but so good 
think we have interesting things to talk about so quickly dispatch what i think is the least interesting thing 
is the idea of dualism right the old fashioned cartesian idea that there is a mind distinct from the 
without localization in space or time immaterial that somehow talks to it so not in favor of that and 
am i so explain why pg so i think maybe the problems of dualism are perhaps of a more 
scientific form so maybe the problems of materialism are more philosophical in nature problems of materialism of dualism sorry 
more straightforwardly scientific so most dualists although they think the mind and the brain are distinct they also want 
hold that they stand in an intimate causal relationship so that when light hits the retina of the eye 
changes in the brain which will bring about visual experiences in the soul or vice versa the decisions of 
soul to raise the arm make changes in the brain and cause the arm to go up so an 
causal relationship there pg so from my point of view if there were an immaterial entity impacting on the 
every second of waking life i think that would really show up in our neuroscience be all sorts of 
happening in the brain that had no physical explanation be like a poltergeist was playing with the brain and 
think not what we see and so i think that gives us an evergrowing sort of inductive argument against 
i want to completely stop taking dualism seriously in my mind i think a lot of including david chalmers 
a lot of interesting work done on this but to my mind got a bit of a hurdle to 
with those kind of problems sc yeah and i completely agree with everything you said and i said similar 
in the big picture again because people might have some familiarity with the discourse here there is a distinction 
between property dualists and substance dualists property dualists thinking that there is the mind is truly another sorry substance 
thinking that the mind is truly another kind of substance and i think that chalmers is that but property 
thinking that there are different kinds of properties that physical stuff has physical properties and mental properties and i 
that chalmers to the extent that he will allow himself to be pinned down to any actual position is 
something closer to that and maybe you have some sympathies along those lines too pg yeah this tends the 
dualists position tends to go along with at least in david case a commitment to special psycho physical laws 
if you just have the laws of physics the thought is you have consciousness all be zombies but these 
psycho physical laws that are as fundamental as the laws of physics because those laws are governing when you 
certain physical states of affairs they give rise to consciousness actually let me say interesting to say often when 
to people who consider themselves materialists they will often say they often take that to be the view that 
brain produces consciousness but not materialism dualism if the brain produces consciousness then consciousness is this extra stuff pg 
i actually think at least among the sort of people who are just thinking about this in general i 
a lot of people who think of themselves as materialists actually turn out to be property dualists and found 
when i explain to them what materialism is like no of course sc horrified chuckle pg so yeah so 
might find sc but this is exactly why philosophy is important right pg yeah sure sc because people think 
they have a view on something and they really thought it through and they talk in sloppy pg exactly 
and so you can analyze going on and go no no your implications are not quite what are implied 
your pg sure absolutely yeah sc okay good so not even spend too much time we should pause to 
credit to princess elizabeth who was the first to raise this problem of how the immaterial mind is supposed 
interact with the body which is now grown up to be called the interaction problem and are there many 
hard core substance dualists hanging around these days in philosophy departments pg yeah just a quick word on princess 
so she was expressing worries about the intelligibility of the relationship between something physical and something nonphysical i think 
people these days worry so much about that more that will be a more philosophical worry the worry these 
is more an empirical concern of the sort been talking about are there many substance dualists actually not so 
chalmers is not unsympathetic to substance dualism actually definitely martine nidarümelin who is in the university of fribourg in 
is an excellent philosopher and substance dualist of some kind but as i say in my book a passionate 
and she just thinks that the conscious mind is not physical but a natural phenomenon that arises from the 
and law governed and so i think actually motivated to substance dualism at least in part because of thoughts 
identity over time pg i think some substance dualists and maybe we want to get into all that but 
people are worried sc but once the wave function of the universe starts branching into multiple copies it raises 
whole another conundrum for those kinds of things chuckle pg yeah not going to be worried about it in 
case so i think that might be part of the motivation of such people but yeah sc alright so 
that aside hundreds of years of very difficult work in philosophy and consciousness studies materialism so we have the 
postgalileo that made of these things we can describe them mathematically there is always this slight footnote to trying 
be a good materialist which is that what we think the material actually is changes over time right like 
would have thought one thing and then atoms came along and then quantum mechanics came along so hard even 
pin down what you mean by materialism or physicalism i will grant that sc but i think the basic 
is that there is stuff the stuff obeys laws of physics the laws of physics are impersonal right equations 
differential equations maybe something more advanced than that and it in some level we could talk about the entire 
in just those terms but that then there are other higher level ways sort of useful effective theories or 
you want to call them which come closer to our folk view of the world where there are people 
intentions and thoughts and so forth so not on board with that very sensible perspective do you want to 
us your favorite arguments against it oh yeah pg actually i want to get sc want to put words 
your mouth yeah pg lost in definitions at the start actually not sure any of that was inconsistent with 
you said actually sc i did say all there is pg well maybe get to that the way i 
define materialism actually i know whether you sympathize is that the fundamental nature of reality can be captured with 
purely quantitative vocabulary involving just mathematical and causal terms so at least part of the definition would you be 
with that sc well willing to be happy with it when you say it out loud it strikes me 
odd because trying to define materialism and the operative words in your definition were things like math and quantitative 
that seems to be a slight sliding of what really aiming at here i mean my definition whatever it 
be and i claim to have the most perfect definition but stuff obeying the laws of physics and a 
description like no extra properties over and above the physical properties the important thing for me pg but the 
think that as well sc well get there get there okay good pg yeah yeah come back to that 
so put it this way operationalize it you agree with materialism so tell me why you agree pg yeah 
philosophers get lost in pedantry sc no important very happy to do that yeah pg okay so it really 
back to what we were talking about earlier so maybe another way of putting it i know from your 
what is the job of a theory of reality what are we trying the data for a theory of 
and i guess i think think that the data is the data of observation and experiment right if got 
theory that can account very roughly maybe you want a nuanced one pg if you can account for all 
the data of observation and experiment in the most satisfying elegant simple way job done whereas i think not 
another bit of data something else we know to be real namely consciousness and not something we know from 
and experiment if you look inside head you see their feelings and experiences so if your aim is just 
account for observation and experiment then never have any reason to postulate consciousness as i think daniel dennett is 
consistent on this pg but we do know that consciousness exists we know it from our immediate awareness of 
own feelings and experiences in fact i think descartes was right that the reality of consciousness is known with 
greater certainty than anything about the external world and an extra datum that needs to be accounted for and 
assume from the start that the postulations we made to account for observation and experiment will also account for 
other data in fact in a way be strange if it did given that what you deal in the 
you deal in are tailored for a specific purpose explaining observation and experiment it would be kind of a 
coincidence if they also explained these subjective qualities that aware of in a completely different way pg so just 
sort of prima facie thing but then coming to the crux of it i think good reason to think 
the postulations of physical science alone cannot account for the reality of consciousness and again coming back to the 
that consciousness has a sorry consciousness has a qualitative nature whereas physical science deals with this purely quantitative vocabulary 
so let me put the point again in a slightly different way you cannot so i think just when 
have heard about hard problem sometimes they think we just got the solution but i think not to get 
the philosophical core of this the problem is you cannot even capture the qualities of consciousness in the language 
neuroscience and one way to see if you could if you could capture what like to see red in 
language of neuroscience you could convey to a blind from birth neuroscientist what like to see red the qualitative 
of red experience which seems absurd you can only know what like to see red when you actually have 
red experience pg so i think you can because of its limited vocabulary i think you can even capture 
qualities of consciousness in the language of neuroscience so a kind of expressive limitation and i think that expressive 
implies an explanatory limitation because if you were going to explain the qualities of consciousness in the language of 
it seems to me have to convey those qualities in the language of neuroscience and then explain them in 
fundamental physical terms if you even convey them you even express them then i think you can explain them 
so i think there are good in principle reasons to think neuroscience alone physical science alone because of its 
vocabulary give us a complete account of this phenomenon we know to be real so it be complete and 
be true sc yeah and i good this is exactly what i really wanted to dig into i completely 
that consciousness is real never been very sympathetic to people who said it was an illusion i mean dennett 
think maybe less consistent or less clear than you give him credit for because he gets upset when people 
he denies the reality of consciousness but he does sometimes seem to be calling it an illusion and not 
where to land sc but i think an illusion i think a higher level emerging phenomenon but i think 
very different thing so torn give you two choices i want to talk about zombies i want to talk 
intrinsic natures which do you think makes sense to talk about first pg go with zombies sc yeah before 
because i want to get into the details of what you just said but a nice little thought experiment 
the table would be useful so give me your version of the zombie argument pg yeah i mean i 
you prefer zombies rather than mary sc i think yeah no easy even frank jackson who invented mary gave 
on her eventually so i think on firm ground there so why know tell us about mary the color 
pg yeah i think i prefer mary in some way it seems to always it gets very technical the 
argument i think so mary is sc sorry just to put it on the table i think that zombies 
the best argument against pan psychism which i do want to talk about that at some point but we 
talk about mary first pg so i think really just a way of explicating and giving further support to 
already been talking about so mary is this genius color scientist who knows everything neuroscience can teach you about 
experience so the wavelengths hitting the eyes the changes that makes in the brain how it gives rise to 
forms of behavior but for some reason never explained been raised in a black and white room chuckle sc 
the backstory the exposition is not very good pg i think in a way we could have just had 
colorblind neuroscientist or something you know this guy nobi a color expert who can only see black and white 
shades of gray and has written some interesting stuff from his own position anyway right anyway so go back 
mary so she knows everything there is to know everything sorry i should say everything neuroscience can teach you 
color experience and then one day but never actually seen colors of this black and white room and one 
again not explained liberated from the black and white room and she sees colors for the first time pg 
the proponent in the knowledge argument says this point she learns something new she learns what like to see 
problem with this is so the story and because the story is so simple i think people are often 
quick to think got the argument but so the argument the knowledge argument based on this story the thought 
if materialism is true then in principle neuroscience ought to be able to give us a complete story of 
essential nature of color experience a complete account of going on mary by stipulation knows that so there ought 
be nothing more she can learn about the nature of color experience she knows it all pg the analogy 
give in my book is if got the complete final theory of black holes right you ought to be 
to it ought to be the case that you learn anything new any new essential features of black holes 
the complete final theory so it ought to be if materialism is true nothing more that mary can learn 
yet when she comes out of her room she does gain some new information about the essential nature of 
experience she learns what like to see color and this is information that be got from the neuroscience and 
in some sense the neuroscientific account must have been incomplete because information about color experience that goes beyond what 
neuroscience can provide pg and then so just to link it back to what been talking about a lot 
what is that information what did she learn she learns about the qualitative character of colors the redness of 
red experience what a congenitally blind neuroscientist no matter how much neuroscience they learn will never know about so 
there that goes beyond what neuroscience can capture that sorry it was a big longwinded sc no no this 
good so what i would say about that i have a long thing to say but let me just 
the short thing if mary knows everything about the neuroscience of color that is to say what exactly happens 
a human brain when a human being looks at something that is red clearly that is different from experiencing 
no one argues with that and so the analogy to me is if i give you all the laws 
particle physics and atomic physics and gravity and so forth and you know them and you have the equations 
front of you and then i say tell me about the life cycle of a well in principle you 
figure it out in practice an enormous amount of work to do in principle mary could say all i 
to do is to have my neurons fire in the following way which are the ways that they fire 
i were seeing red so i will hook myself up to the correct electrostimulator machine and i will make 
neurons fire in the right way and i will experience the experience of and i see anything in there 
gets in the way of being a materialist pg yeah but if you learning the theory of black so 
i completely agree i think this i think a little bit people always think the argument is heard about 
change in mary that how come she she knows all the neuroscience how come she experience not the argument 
course of course the materialism the materialist does not have to not a problem for materialists but notice the 
to know the relevant facts about black holes picked a complicated example let me start again pg to know 
the facts about black holes you have to become a black hole chuckle it ought to be the case 
you can know everything there is to know about color experience from the neuroscience in view not saying you 
to be able to experience colors no not the point you ought to be able to know all the 
from the neuroscience and just conceded that you do that you have she has to have changes in her 
why does she have to do that if materialism is true if materialism is true all the information should 
there in the neuroscience and got it you have to turn yourself into a black hole to learn the 
of black holes why do you have to make changes to your brain to know the full theory of 
color experience is sc yeah i think because set up the question a certain way you need to be 
black hole to know what it is like to be a black hole and of course the difference which 
completely agree with is that black holes have selfawareness or thoughts or anything like that so you can argue 
there anything that is like to be a black hole i can see that there is something it is 
to be a person but because we have the capacity to hold in our brains representations of ourselves and 
towards things and therefore i would say not a very good analogy there is something that is different even 
a materialist pg do you think information mary in her black and white room do you think information about 
nature of color experience she have sc in principle no but again conceding that it is different to know 
bunch of facts about neuroscience and to experience something i just think that from knowing those facts about neuroscience 
can experience something without actually experiencing it you can make your brain do the things that it would do 
you are experiencing it and that would be the same as actually experiencing it because all happening is things 
are happening in your neurons pg so i think two different things going on here one is a question 
complexity the in principle question and that was your life cycle of a star or what was it the 
of a star sc yeah pg and this is something dennett often presses and i think a little bit 
a red herring maybe an unfortunate consequence of the way jackson set up the thought experiment he said she 
everything physical every quark and every but i think you need to set it up like that presumably the 
theory is just going to be a natural extension of what we have today so i think implausible to 
a normal human being could know that so i so i think we can set on one side these 
about in principle knowing the point is as you accept some information here that you have to make changes 
your brain to get that information and suggesting if materialism is true weird why would you have to make 
to your brain to get the information so let me put it all agreeing that you have to make 
to have the experience but i suppose the why do you have to have the experience to get the 
the question sc that seem even a little bit surprising to me like i could tell you in gruesome 
the correct way to shoot a free throw in basketball and you can sit at your desk and you 
study everything there is to know about shooting a free throw and if never shot a free throw before 
going to be very good at it because the way that we learn things through our eyes and our 
and recording information is just different than how our body reacts to these things not surprising as a materialist 
okay good good now what presenting i think is known as the ability hypothesis response right which is originally 
his name nemeroff leonard nemeroff was it and but it was defended by david lewis quite a big figure 
philosophy generally so anyway the view is here so i keep trying to press on you information information mary 
in her black room but what lewis says and nemeroff she gain new information she gains new knowhow new 
what she learns she learns how to imagine red categorize things as red remember red and so on so 
gains new knowhow now a perfectly good response because then yeah neuroscience gives you all the information she just 
some new abilities not a problem for materialism okay so i think there were a couple of problems with 
response do you want a technical one or an intuitive one sc give us both give us whatever you 
you want let you decide technical is fine we have an hour long here plenty of time pg the 
one is it seems you can put these sentences about what like to see red into deductive syllogisms so 
could say mary could say this is what like for me to see red and this is what like 
billy to see red this is what like for me to see red therefore it is what like for 
to see red so a valid truthpreserving argument there and i forget whether the premises are true or false 
that seems to show that these sentences are truth claims and the problem with the ability hypothesis is it 
any account of that it just talks about abilities but abilities are not the same as truth claims so 
sort of sc well this is actually i mean maybe it will be helpful to talk a little bit 
intrinsic natures which i mentioned before and you talk about it in the book because i think that this 
the fundamental underlying issue that we have that galileo and i have with you and panpsychists the idea pg 
is on my side sc well i could write a book saying you made an error so you know 
yeah sorry sc built your house got to live in it pg sorry stop interrupting now sc i think 
so well i mean why you say i put words in your mouth why you tell us what you 
by the idea that physics tell us physics tells us what things do but it tell us about their 
nature and this is also it goes back to bertrand russell right i actually learned from your book that 
was one of the big names in panpsychism i know that pg yeah well actually russell as i put 
some of the footnotes quite have a panpsychist interpretation of it pg he quite get there yeah pg as 
as damnit just because he had some funny terminological issues but anyway yeah so i think actually been a 
resurgence of interest in panpsychism in academic philosophy in the last years gone from being laughed at insofar as 
was thought of at all to being taken quite seriously and i think this is largely due to the 
of this work important work from the by arthur eddington scientist and bertrand russell so inclined to think these 
did in the for the science of consciousness what darwin did for the science of life in the century 
sort of a tragedy of history that it got kind of forgotten about pg okay so the starting point 
as you were just alluding to that physics tells us a lot less than you might think about the 
of physical reality so in the public mind physics is giving us this complete story of the nature of 
and time and matter but what russell and eddington realized is actually upon reflection it turns out that physical 
is confined to telling us about the behavior of matter about what it does so physics talks about mass 
charge we characterize mass in terms of gravitational attraction resistance to acceleration charge is characterized in terms of traction 
repulsion this all concerns what particles or fields do physics is completely silent on what philosophers like to call 
intrinsic nature of a physical entity how it is in and of itself independently of its behavior pg and 
this is sometimes called the problem of intrinsic natures it looks like this huge hole in our scientific story 
the universe and then just to link to consciousness very briefly i think the genius of russell and eddington 
to bring together two problems that on the face of it have nothing much to do with each other 
problem of consciousness and the problem of intrinsic natures so the problem of consciousness is roughly a need to 
a place for consciousness in our scientific story the problem of intrinsic natures is that we have this huge 
in our scientific story of the universe so the unified solution is put consciousness in the hole pg so 
for a place for consciousness got this big hole put consciousness in the hole so the resulting theory is 
kind of panpsychism just matter or just physical stuff fields maybe nothing spiritual or supernatural but physical reality can 
described as it were from two perspectives physical science describes it as it were from the outside tells us 
information about its behavior but as it were from the inside its intrinsic nature is constituted of forms of 
so this is a beautifully simple elegant unified way of integrating consciousness into our scientific worldview and in contrasted 
consistent with everything we know empirically so from my perspective just final sentence got this challenge of how do 
bring together what we know empirically about the physical world from natural science and what we know this qualitative 
we know from our immediate awareness of consciousness this gives us a way of bringing them together in a 
entirely consistent with both yeah so the big picture of the view i try to defend sc yeah and 
think the reason why i wanted to bring that up right now is because it is the underlying to 
the underlying source of all of our other disagreements in some sense i totally would buy the idea that 
told me what this stuff does done there is no anything else there is no such thing as the 
nature of stuff and i think maybe this is where you can educate me i think that reflects back 
our discussion about mary whether or or just more generally what it is like to be something i think 
it is like to be something what it is like to experience red ultimately is a description of certain 
going on in our neurons in our bodies sc and i have a strong opinion about whether or not 
are truth claims associated with that that are intermind the old question of whether the red i see is 
same as the red you see not sure whether it has a sensible explanation but i do think that 
say experiencing red that not only correlates exactly with certain neurons doing something in my brain but is just 
way of saying that certain neurons are doing something in my brain so i think that is the same 
the intrinsic nature disagreement is that fair pg let me just say one thing which i i think you 
have a coherent position and i describe it as denying the reality of consciousness i think you you had 
dialogues in your book of people think denying consciousness and maybe some of my antiphysicalist comrades would say that 
if that view works out i think clearly accepting the reality of consciousness i just think ultimately coherent but 
a brief point not inclined to agree that this comes down to whether we need intrinsic natures to my 
a distinct and more contentious view i can imagine being persuaded we could look at some of the arguments 
you want as to why we need to postulate intrinsic natures at all but i can imagine being persuaded 
sure we a coherent picture of the world in which no intrinsic natures and so on this kind of 
things are just doings rather than beings once said what it does said everything pg but i still i 
think well this qualitative reality what about these qualities we need some account of them and i yet heard 
explanation in physical science terms and i would push these arguments that there are in principle the reasons to 
that can be done so i guess i would be inclined to think these are distinct issues sc where 
became unclear to me is when you bring up the qualitative features the qualitative experiences and so forth maybe 
this wrong but it at least reminds me resonates with the idea that there is something over and above 
the things are doing and maybe not intrinsic nature still something over and above what things are doing pg 
maybe put it like this i think there are two reasons why we need intrinsic natures one not sure 
to have a picture of the world without them forget about consciousness and we could get into these arguments 
be or not but the other is there is this reality we know about and hard to see how 
can account for it in causal structural terms but in a two steps to that argument one is there 
this data and we need to account for and secondly to my mind they are good arguments why it 
accounted for in causal structural terms so i suppose there yeah you get the implication that a kind of 
nature yeah yeah maybe right but sc maybe it is i want to give you a chance to give 
positive case and explanation for panpsychism which kind of only alluded to so far but i think because i 
think that this kind of divergence is at the heart of all of our divergences maybe it is worth 
some words about why you think that intrinsic natures really are necessary if i knew all of the mathematical 
and causal relationships among the physical stuff of the universe and could say what everything did there would still 
something lacking so i think any lacking once that happens and you do tell us why pg okay get 
that argument but i think just clarified to myself going on so let i think you seem to be 
that i believe in intrinsic natures because i think consciousness is irreducible not the other way around not like 
start off saying there must be these intrinsic because of consciousness but also i do think there must be 
natures so maybe we could get into the argument sc it might be logically separate but they are in 
same spirit all i would say those two facts pg yeah an interesting thought it might be something i 
have to think a little bit more about people defending this russelleddington picture going right back to russell have 
to defend this kind of argument to the conclusion that a world without intrinsic natures is just unintelligible and 
go a little bit back and forward on these arguments i have to say not committed but the thought 
without intrinsic natures everything ends up being defined in terms of everything else and you end up in a 
of vicious circle i have an appendix to one of the chapters of my book so the thought is 
start up saying mass and you say just keep things simple ignore general relativity and you just say it 
gravitational and then you say well and you say i know the distance between bodies is and you say 
and then you get another bunch of equations that explicates distance in terms of other physical properties like mass 
charge and you quickly find yourself back in a circle and without any way of getting an independent grip 
any of these properties it looks like these definitions just get off the ground so the analogy i give 
the book is suppose got three matchboxes and i say in the first one a splurge in the second 
a blurge and in the third one a curge and you say a and i say easy the blurge 
something that makes pg you say well i know what that means until i know what a splurge is 
and i say splurge is a thing that makes and you say i what that means either till i 
what a curge and i say a thing that makes and you know what the hell is in the 
so i sort to think actually and this is how russell thought this is actually how physics works interdefined 
so without a kind of independent grip we really get an understanding of what any of these things are 
that was the kind of argument he pressed what do you reckon sc yeah just very quickly say why 
do not find that argument convincing but glad that out there i agree that an individual term like mass 
defined without talking about other things absolutely interconnectedness but rather than circularity i would just say one defines an 
formal system spacetime is a fourdimensional manifold lorentzian metric blah blah blah blah and a whole bunch of individually 
well defined parts of that formal system and then one maps it onto the data of our experience and 
explained the world i think circular i do think interconnected so not convinced there you go pg but what 
i say what is a field tell me what a field is sc oh a field is a section 
fiber bundle there is a mathematical formalism and i can pinpoint individual parts of it so i care to 
about the intrinsic nature of them my escape hatch if i care about what it really is if i 
care about where it is in the math then done pg even if yeah so look this there are 
couple of different issues here one is there are two subtly related views i guess defending a kind sometimes 
ontic structuralism that in some sense is just structure but there are two closely related views here one is 
pure structuralism where just what can be captured mathematically another is causal structuralism which is a little bit more 
what can be captured with mathematics and causal terms and in that view we ultimately define the nature of 
in terms of what they do would you say that you were going for the former or the latter 
i think the former yeah not a big fan of causal terms and fundamental ontology pg right right so 
world can be just entirely captured in mathematical language sc yeah so there is the world and there is 
mathematical formal system and an isomorphism between them and all complicated and philosophy is necessary because also our folk 
of the world which is like a third thing that we have to map on to both of those 
interesting ways but a coherent set of interconnections not a circular argument the interesting thing pg okay well i 
in that case maybe we sympathetic to a kind of i think maybe been talking slightly at cross purposes 
that argument is more an attack on people who want to take causation as a fundamental feature and we 
the nature of say an electron in terms of what it does yeah i think that problem goes away 
little bit if you just and in fact there has been a reply to a volume of essays on 
form of panpsychism and alyssa ney a philosopher a very good philosopher of physics is replying in exactly these 
arguing that we could just have the wave function or something expressed in completely mathematical language sc just parenthetically 
am the author of an idea called maddog everettianism where literally all that exists is a vector in a 
hilbert space representing the universe and hamiltonian tell us how it evolves and everything else space time matter particle 
are just particular human constructions to conveniently talk about what that wave function does over time pg sure yeah 
i guess at that what i would say is okay are you familiar with problem have you heard that 
sc heard of it but i explain it so why you explain it yes pg well the problem is 
remember the details either so the way thought about these things is the causal structuralism faces this regress problem 
the more pure structuralism faces problem but a while since looked at the details so i think be able 
defend that but say you persuade me that the maddog everettianism you just described describes a possible reality and 
that theory can account for data all the data of observation experiments then say fine fair enough but say 
look this other datum how do you account for this of the qualitative reality of consciousness and then be 
to the knowledge argument be back to my claim that you account for that in a purely quantitative vocabulary 
so in a way look i just think the reality of consciousness is a datum in its own right 
and above the data of experiments and observation if got a theory that can account for all the data 
observation experiments but you account for this then your theory work and you said i guess said okay of 
not going to want to deny consciousness but in all of the cases an option that there are lots 
phenomena that are difficult to fit into our scientific world view facts about value that i know interested in 
about free will abstract objects solidity in some sense maybe our folk notion of solidity or our folk notions 
time in all of these cases at least an option to either deny the phenomenon or revise our understanding 
it pg maybe there really facts about value maybe not really free in the way we think we are 
time how we thought it was but i think with consciousness a reality that we know in such a 
way that i think an option to either deny it or revise it so i think it has a 
special place in our methodology and because of that one needs to be hesitant about whether the stuff we 
to account for observation of experiments can also account for this and i heard from you yet a story 
how done said that it can do it but you told me how it does it sc well yeah 
think done it yet so there you go and very happy to admit that but the extent to which 
with materialism is just so vast that of course consciousness being involved with the most complicated structures we know 
in the universe will be the last thing that science successfully explains not because it requires something separate just 
why hard but anyway i think we could get stuck here rather i want you really here is the 
can i just say something briefly sc sure sure pg i think where it comes back to the galileo 
precisely maybe not get that yeah science is so impressive but impressive at a very limited task describing the 
of matter roughly mathematical models that capture it was never in the business of accounting for these subjective qualities 
immediately aware of never what been doing to say oh been good at this one thing so going to 
good at this other thing i just think something confused going on there i mean i have this analogy 
my book that when i my first year as a lecturer the head of department very kindly let me 
administration and i was pretty good at the other aspects of the job i was pretty good at teaching 
pretty good at research the fact that i was good at teaching and research give you any reason to 
going to be good at admin right pg so similarly the fact that physics has been really good physical 
more generally really good at these mathematical models to describe behavior why does that give you any reason to 
going to be able to capture these subjective qualities that immediately aware of anyway sorry sc no no actually 
glad you said that let me respond to it and see whether or not we can restrain ourselves from 
back and forth i think crucially important because when you have something like consciousness like when you have any 
of scientific explanation or broader philosophical explanation that finished yet right we admit that we have the full understanding 
of us does and therefore as individual scholars and researchers we make bets we have credences about what is 
most likely future path of progress and i talk about this in my upcoming book i kind of breezed 
it in the big picture but in something deeply hidden where talking about quantum mechanics i think that it 
illuminate why some people are cheerful everettians and some people find it to be abhorrent and therefore go for 
variables or something like that sc and because we do have the world of our experience our sort of 
data collecting experience and our subjective inner experience lump it all into one thing and we yet fully explained 
and which is more likely among the following two options number one is an explanation that is more or 
close to the phenomena that observing like the structures within the explanation a lot of them and kind of 
complicated set of things going on but the map between those structures and what we experience and what we 
is very clear and crisp and easy that would be a hidden variable approach to quantum mechanics where of 
particles and waves in the doubleslit experiment particles and waves in my ontology sc or the other option is 
have an extremely beautiful austere simple powerful underlying formalism but the road from there to explaining the world of 
experience is long and fraught with peril right the everettians perspective where like i said you just have one 
in a big hilbert space and you have a lot of work to do to say why the world 
like three dimensional space plus time with fields and all that stuff and either one of those options is 
much on the table and there is a matter of taste or style that comes into saying pretty sure 
right sc and i think it likewise for consciousness of course we have not explained consciousness in any convincing 
as materialists but i have no trouble believing that it will eventually happen because materialism is so beautiful and 
and so powerful and i get even if i agree with the perspective that says just see how ever 
here from and i think a perfectly valid perspective and i think that progress will be made and figure 
out pg and do you think that when we get the final physical explanation it will be able to 
to a congenitally blind neuroscientist what like to see red sc by going in and manipulating their brain yes 
by talking to them pg so it give all the information sc just like i teach someone to be 
good free throw shooter by talking to them either pg okay let me and this is not getting back 
it but i mean i completely agree with that whole thing you just said with every phenomenon except consciousness 
i think every other phenomenon is capturing the causal structure of the universe but this we know about it 
that way we know about it in a very different way and so i think that gives us the 
to give a different credence to it because we have a very different epistemological relationship with it i think 
apprehend its reality directly and we know something about its reality directly i think when i attend to the 
in my experience i know something about their nature i have that with tables if i had that with 
if i could magically know something about their nature then maybe that would give me less credence than physical 
can explain it but i have that just but with consciousness i think i have some direct access to 
nature and so why i think i can have a very different credence in the possibility of physics i 
up coming back to the argument i said i sorry sc i know and biting my tongue i have 
to say what i really want to say is tell us what panpsychism actually says give it a sales 
at a used car dealership and your used consciousness theory dealership and someone has wandered onto the lot and 
would like to sell them this panpsychist vehicle that been trying to move for a long time what is 
sales pitch pg well i think in a way already described it that just matter just what physical science 
but let me emphasize actually how nondualist it is because often when people hear about panpsychism they and i 
actually you said this a little bit in your book actually that you think well the electron has its 
properties like mass charge and spin and it also has these consciousness properties and you rightfully said that ought 
show up in our physics these extra properties not the view right the view is mass spin and charge 
themselves forms of consciousness right so physics tells us what mass spin and charge do but it tell us 
they are what those properties are and so a radically nondualistic account and by the very way set up 
to be completely consistent with what we know scientifically how would i sell it let me can i say 
briefly how i think about the science of consciousness sc actually could you do me a favor and tell 
very charming story that you told in the book of your conversion experience pg oh no my wife told 
to take that out she thought it was too cringy laughter pg no no the best part look you 
part of being a good but you have to but in the book i guess pg i guess just 
through various phases of always been obsessed by the problem of consciousness as far back as i can remember 
thought i was a materialist sc but the point is you were a materialist so pg i was a 
yeah sc you can claim to know what like to be a materialist pg and i eventually came to 
point of view somewhat dennettian point of view that if a materialist incompatible with the qualitative reality of consciousness 
defended that for a while whilst feeling like i was living in bad faith that i was not really 
and yeah just one night and just certain vivid experiences got to me and i just decided this go 
anymore but actually at that point i was taught as philosophy undergraduate the only two options are materialism and 
and i thought both of these are hopeless and i was very disillusioned and i wrote my end of 
undergraduate dissertation on how the problem of consciousness be resolved and i went off and did something else and 
panpsychism was not taught those days and i discovered there is this elegant middle way that does accept the 
of consciousness but is completely consistent with our empirical knowledge of the world so i think that was sc 
you say something like mass charge and spin are properties of consciousness is pg no they are forms of 
sc forms of consciousness okay what i want to say is what in the world does that mean pg 
i think nothing some people think a mystery of what consciousness is i think a mystery i think you 
nothing is more obvious than what a you know what a feeling of pain is when you have it 
the mystery is how consciousness fits into our theory of the world so human consciousness is very rich and 
consciousness of horses less so mice less so we keep getting simpler and simpler forms of inorganic life maybe 
some point the lights switch off we have no consciousness at all but it seems at least coherent that 
we get simpler and simpler forms of matter you have simpler and simpler forms of consciousness such as when 
get to the just assume for the sake of simplicity a particle ontology which a panpsychist does not necessarily 
to commit to although you often talk about one often talks that way for the sake of simplicity pg 
electron has an unimaginably simple form of experience so we even imagine something so simple that seems to me 
coherent view you might think crazy but it seems a realistic coherent view moreover i think reason to take 
seriously because we know that consciousness is real we have to fit it into reality somehow if you think 
and dualism have got such deep problems that not really going to make it happen then this gives us 
way of doing it that avoids all the problems and it feels a bit weird but so what sc 
no weird obviously going to have to accept it if we talk about any of these things but weird 
okay but i really want to get a if i were very cynical here would be my problem i 
an electron i have equations for what it does it has a mass charge and spin i have the 
equation i have quantum field theory i can tell you exactly what it will do as the materialist physicist 
to say done i know what the electron is and how it behaves and you want to say and 
has some very very primitive limited form of conscious experience is that fair pg but it depends on what 
mean by not a further property saying told me what mass does but you told me what it is 
right so something i told you yet just put it that way so something extra that i yet told 
but that something extra i yet told you has no mathematical description pg yeah right sc and it also 
it have causal influences on the behavior of anything pg yeah the thought is been telling me this cool 
about what mass does and then the panpsychist view is mass is a form of consciousness so actually this 
of consciousness been doing all the stuff been talking about not like the consciousness and then something else just 
forms of consciousness and been telling me what they do so like i know you hear someone banging in 
apartment downstairs and you know making this noise but you know what it is and then you discover an 
i know so you physicists study what these properties do but on this view not saying what they are 
sc maybe not putting this exactly right so mass is a form of consciousness pg yeah sc is that 
everything is a form of consciousness or these physical properties are forms of consciousness is the wave function of 
universe a form of consciousness pg yeah look it depends on what you think the fundamental ontology is so 
panpsychist view is whatever your fundamental physical story is that will give you some structure but then got to 
well what realizes that structure and what realizes that structure are forms of consciousness so if you have a 
based ontology then these particles will if got a sorry if got a wave function ontology then you have 
think about that the wave function has its intrinsic nature as consciousness sc so i was just asking does 
this is part of the panpsychist view that everything has an aspect of consciousness pg everything at the fundamental 
so the panpsychists need not hold it like rocks and socks and beds are conscious not every arbitrary collection 
things is conscious but everything has components or its most basic parts are conscious or the physical reality that 
it at least has a consciousness involving nature the view sc but okay just trying to get straight i 
a materialist who use those words have a theory of what does happen in the world and your theory 
what does happen in the world your theory as a panpsychist need not be any different from mine right 
right exactly taken to be the benefit of the view we want our theory of consciousness to get in 
way of physics right yeah sc right but okay so this is where i think that the zombie thought 
is actually helpful because if true different versions of the zombie thought experiment so let me just always conditionalize 
various assumptions here if true that given the atoms and particles and forces in me including in my brain 
my neurons and so forth i could in principle be demon and solve the laws of physics and say 
what i would do modulo quantum uncertainty and so forth and that would include things like showing me something 
and me saying yes that is red i am experiencing and all that goes through perfectly well in both 
our different views of the world then not quite sure what is added by the panpsychist perspective sc in 
words let me give you the very short version of that so the zombie is david idea of a 
thing that acts exactly like things in the real world a physical collection of atoms and so forth but 
does not have consciousness and my point is if it acts exactly the same that includes when you ask 
you have consciousness or are you experiencing it says and if you ask it you it says so clearly 
honestly thinks conscious but not by hypothesis so by that therefore none of us knows that not a zombie 
think that conscious just like we do and therefore really added nothing pg okay this sounds a little bit 
to what you said the first time the first time you simply said well just brutally the difference between 
world physically identical and lacks consciousness and one i know how to say it more clearly but in the 
that when we describe physical reality we use these quantitative concepts when we describe consciousness we use these qualitative 
we talk about colors and smells and the qualitative character it seems perfectly coherent to hypothesize that you might 
one without the other but coming to your second argument as understanding it well this imply none of us 
know we were conscious pg there are tricky issues here actually just as a preliminary thought about the relationship 
thought and consciousness so the dominant view in my philosophical tradition has been that thought has nothing to do 
consciousness and you can see this because the dominant theories of thought in the century such as jerry fodor 
donald davidson or dennett have absolutely nothing to say about consciousness so they think you can give a complete 
of thought without talking about consciousness and so on that sc the more about computation and so forth pg 
some kind of functional behavioral facts very very broadly speaking so on that view a zombie would have thoughts 
would think conscious as he say but actually one of a growing minority of philosophers who think actually thought 
a kind of consciousness and if true then the zombie have any thoughts at all so one way you 
go with this but maybe getting into slightly contentious territory but the other thing to say yeah the zombie 
in all the same ways but i know about my consciousness not the case that i know about my 
by observing myself i know about it because immediately aware of my own experiences sc but just what a 
would say pg it would say that but not true of the zombie by stipulation it have what justifies 
grounds my knowledge of consciousness is my immediate awareness of my own pain and by stipulation what a zombie 
yeah i know where to go with this or what to say yeah sc no i think both of 
positions are out there all i ever ask for in a podcast is that people understand what both sides 
saying so be a little bit more futureoriented and proactive what do you think of the prospects for consciousness 
panpsychism and you try to end the book on an uplifting note and i think an interesting perspective to 
with pg sure so i think this view has been getting taken much more seriously in academic philosophy part 
the reason i wrote this book is written an academic book consciousness of fundamental reality which is reasonably well 
bringing together a lot of this recent literature been a huge amount published on this view but i really 
to get it out to a broader audience because not really a complete view this russelleddington view a framework 
it will take decades or centuries of interdisciplinary labor to fill in the details just as principle of natural 
is a basic framework for understanding how life evolves but then it takes a century to get to dna 
so really i think this is going to i just think people are naturally conservative hard to persuade people 
arguments but i just think we need to get on with this if enough people are on board with 
to do this and already very interesting work going on well let me just say actually maybe i could 
say about how i think about the science of consciousness and this relates to materialism as well because i 
the science of consciousness has to have an empirical aspect and a theoretic aspect i think some people think 
can just do the empirical bit but i think neuroscience as vital as it is just gives you correlations 
move beyond that we need to build a theory and i think a theory of consciousness should be judged 
two constraints going a little bit beyond what i say in the book actually an external constraint and an 
constraint pg so the external constraint is just to fit the data obviously crucial the internal constraint is to 
and minimize or ideally eliminate explanatory gaps that is places in the theory where going from one set of 
to another with no account of how that happens so the problem with materialism materialism just looking at the 
a theory in its own right and it has an enormous on the face of it explanatory gap between 
quantitative properties and the qualitative reality of consciousness i think already the russelleddington view makes progress there because we 
have an intelligible account of the relationship between physical states and conscious states conscious states are the intrinsic nature 
physical states so i think already explanatory progress there but plenty of work to be done pg and so 
crucial next step is how we think about the relationship between particle consciousness or consciousness at lower levels and 
at higher levels is this a causal relationship in the sense that we need basic laws of nature to 
the gap or is this a constitutive relationship in the sense that in some sense the higher level forms 
consciousness come for free once got the more basic forms of consciousness and how do we make sense of 
so lots of tricky issues here and already really interesting work going on pg so hedda hassel mørch a 
fellow at university of oslo spent a year recently in the lab with giulio tononi who is the founder 
the integrated information theory of consciousness one of the most best empirically supported theories of consciousness working that out 
the framework of russelleddington panpsychism and what we end up with is a view according to which in any 
the consciousness intrinsic nature is at the level of which most integrated information so i think that this works 
the neuroscientific theory but like any neuroscientific theory if just got the neuroscience just got a correlation but interpreting 
in this russelleddington framework moves beyond the bare correlation gives you a deeper explanation pg another thing i talk 
in the book luke roelofs at university of bochum reflecting on whether split brain patients can help shed light 
mental combinations these are the curious cases where people have the corpus callosum in the middle of their brain 
which allows their two hemispheres to communicate a radical treatment for epilepsy and it seems to lead to a 
of peculiar fragmentation of consciousness it ends up looking like sort of two conscious minds in one person so 
in this is well this split brain case is a kind of the converse of mental combination in mental 
trying to understand how distinct conscious subjects can combine to a single unified conscious subject whereas in split brain 
got a single conscious mind fragmenting into multiple conscious minds so if we can sort of understand going on 
the split brain case and as it were reverse engineer it this might shed light on mental combination pg 
what we need is philosophers in labs or philosophers thinking about how do we make sense of this panpsychist 
in a wave function fundamental view which been actually thinking about actually for something writing for an oup volume 
quantum mechanics and consciousness so i think this needs to be an interdisciplinary labor just in its birth and 
think going to take a much more serious academic philosophy although sometimes people are not entirely comfortable with this 
i think rather than persuading people with the arguments if we just get on with the work i think 
shows that once you just get on and start doing some research and this bears fruit i think when 
start to listen a bit more so very optimistic that a lot of interesting work to be done sorry 
was a bit longwinded sc yeah no i no no no what i was hoping for it does sound 
way or the other whatever our bets are for going to happen in the future i am optimistic that 
right people are beginning to talk to each other and taking these problems seriously like i said i am 
who believes in consciousness as a real thing i would like to understand it i think that we entirely 
sc final issue final question very quickly how do you conceptualize the possible moral or ethical implications of this 
of thing i know that not a simple road from ought to is but everyone agrees that science and 
philosophical ideas about consciousness could have an impact on how we think about morality and ethics do you have 
thoughts about that pg yeah a little bit i talk about this a little bit in the final more 
of experimental chapter of the book i mean first i would say of course as sure agree we be 
about which view most like to be true we should be thinking about which view is most likely to 
true and i think very good reasons for taking panpsychism seriously as the best account of how consciousness fits 
nature but i am also inclined to think that maybe a view slightly better for our mental and spiritual 
in the kind of broad sense chuckle pg materialism is pretty bleak in a way got a kind of 
picture of nature and the cold immensity of empty space and whereas a view we are conscious creatures in 
conscious universe it is we can feel a little bit perhaps more comfortable in our own skin and so 
also i think it has the potential perhaps something i talk about in the book to improve our relationship 
the environment if you think trees and plants are just unfeeling mechanisms then i think inevitably your view of 
value is indirect that their value is indirect in terms of the effect it has on us conscious creatures 
pretty or more importantly maintaining our survival but if you think a tree is some sense a conscious entity 
its own right then i think an object of immediate moral concern chopping down trees something that has an 
moral focus so i do think perhaps this gives in this environmental crisis that we seem to deal with 
all sorts of reasons and this might help a little bit how we relate to nature and the environment 
of course that be the reason to take it seriously sc no right you accept a view because you 
it to be true but i think perfectly legitimate to say i think this view is true and relieved 
happy that it chuckle i think perfectly legit pg sure yeah yeah sc alright thanks so much lot to 
about here philip goff thanks for being on the podcast pg thanks a lot sean really enjoyed that vigorous 
thanks for having me music although i am a cold unfeeling materialist i did enjoy this podcast you show 
powers of restraint and i will leave that there one thing i did want to say though is that 
hint that the consciousness issue will be resolved once neuroscience solves the problem it seems doubtful to me that 
will resolve the issue assuming that the description of how consciousness works is in terms of neurons firing and 
there seems to be no level of description in the materialist universe that would really explain what it feels 
to see red not to anyone let alone someone like phillip goff the selfreferential nature of consciousness makes a 
description of it impossible you hint at this here when you say that there are no words to convey 
it is like to make a basketball free throw even with a neuroscience explanation of consciousness we still be 
to do this such a fun episode so very fun prowess and fairness in equal amounts i will add 
as someone sympathetic to side on room that while it is proposed she has learnt every fact of color 
is untrue as she was not provided in the room with the very personal facts of what it is 
to be mary seeing color subjectivity it seems is information indeed but information hidden to the world at large 
one more thing against panpsychism i would ask then how do you explain that our brain operates with both 
and nonconscious processing cf dehaene ultimately you will need a physicsbased mechanism which is what materialists seek anyway of 
no panpsychism grafted onto it btw it seems to me that panpsychism is just a new form of dualism 
moves the dual nature of consciousness from the human level down to the elementary level of the universe it 
does not explain what consciousness is always curious how guys like him square his view with biological evolution if 
are two different aspects to the nature of things it would be a gigantic coincidence if the physical arrangement 
matter that leads to complex information processing systems also leads to consciousness especially given the fact that those information 
systems arose over billion years of and at least at the least complex end of the scale need nothing 
than physical explanations there is also the fact that sensory input is encoded in the brain as electrical and 
flows in the brain the thing we experience the world directly but those flows thus optical illusions it would 
be pretty amazing if the the physical aspect stumbled on to turn sensory input into brain patterns is exactly 
same coding system the consciousness aspect knows how to always felt those coincidences make the panpsychism view about as 
as creationism thanks for a very interesting discussion of panpsychism and materialism one way to think about this is 
elemental we know that we are carbon based entities incorporating other elements to form the organic molecules that constitute 
for simplicity if we allow carbon to represent all of the physical elements that are involved we can say 
at some point in evolution carbon began to speak eventually carbon became aware that it was carbon no matter 
complex the organization of the carbon in the brain became unless the carbon had some spark of proto consciousness 
seems unlikely that human awareness could have emerged the idea that conscious minds can spring into being if the 
are arranged is like saying demons can arise if the pentagram and candles are aligned sam harris is right 
more than the restatement of a miracle the superstitious voo doo and magic being advocated here by the materialist 
issue and no rational person should ever believe that consciousness can come into being from crude material interactions if 
believe that you will probably believe genies can be the result of rubbed lamps the notion of using something 
we dont fully understand like to plug holes in other concepts that we fully understand is no different to 
of the arguments it seems plausible that consciousness is integrated information see the works of tononi et all httpintegratedinformationtheoryorg 
would be great to have an episode with tononi himself next and thank you rather amazed that i find 
debates between him and goff as to room the information she is missing is the first person subjective experience 
the color red which was point and it seemingly flew right over your head sean ahhhh well these things 
time at least consciousness as fundamental has moved into the fight stage ignore laugh fight win love and light 
galen strawson panpsychism is materialismphysicalism has an article on the mary problem the keith frankish gives a very clear 
of illusionism in this podcast he also gives a nice overview of the philosophical lay of the land for 
there is a transcript if you prefer reading or this academic paper a rough gloss is that conscious experience 
not what it seems to be based on naive introspection illusionism details what it is instead frankish explains why 
and chalmers think it is the best approach for the physicalist who does not want to add panpsychism to 
if you prefer an academic paper im afraid you are not really understanding pgoff consciousness is a process a 
to the very essence of life it selfit cannot be understood by defining itor labelling it it is it 
only be experienced never quantified i was hoping to get some insight that would elevate my perception of panpsychism 
to least but gentle as this was prof defense seemed to debunk itself with little real prompting he went 
up to the door of ontic structuralism for example named it and seems to by shying away on the 
that a dry description of reality feel right generously i might say that obvious to me that panpsychism is 
more honestly i think have to admit that it is clearly taken up either as a linguistic trick to 
and slide a layer of language onto a dryer framework whether materialist or structuralist or something else or a 
religious adherence to a claim which could in principle have no empirical or theoretical meaning depending on who is 
it and why either it is completely compatible with some fundamentally simpler naturalist theory and thus by definition adds 
but assumptions and language to that theory or it is incompatible and if incompatible it either is falsifiable with 
physical data or it is in fact correct and supported by data and is performing the predictive function of 
physical objects instead of some independent claim about what they either way a minimumassumptions predictive theory of reality will 
comprised exclusively of statements about things and people will have to come to terms with that being the best 
to things that could in principle exist that all there the song does not explain subjective experience but has 
reference to our human consciousness listen carefully to the three little stories she tells pingback machines and understanding making 
minds problem is itselfclarify what the relation between mind and matter is it just states that this relationwhatever that 
everywhere thats why you can have physicalist panpsychism dualistic panpsychism both substance and property dualism neutralmonistic panpsychism and idealistic 
actually view of as intrinsic is a form of idealist view objective idealism more specifically in which the world 
mental and this mentality follows some rules in contrast to subjective idealism such as in which the world is 
my mindor mind when i look leibniz had a similar microidealist view in which the true intrinsic nature of 
units of reality are firstperson viewpoints called so what we call particles are trully kastrup is the one who 
recently done a very sophisticated defence of such a view in this the whole universe is a mind and 
physical science describes is the appearance of the structured thoughts which follow some rules which we call so our 
animalsare subpartitions of the whole mind we are all parts of it the reality is simply the appearance of 
structured ideas from our vantage point furthermore in this view particles have minds they are parts of the grand 
they can be described as buidling it is also similar to a type of simulation hypothesis in which the 
can also be thought as a selforganizing program but kastrup like the sim hypothesis if one must stipulate an 
concrete hardware computer of some universe and i agree with him the program with its own firstperson view is 
there is i would like to see an interview with him i myself am undecided between hardcore physicalism with 
for consciousness neutral monism and this form of objective idealism some monistic view of sorts love these discussions i 
to view panpsychism as a form of dualism and not a bad thing re descartes comment i would say 
we feel our subjective consciousness rather than with greater certainty than anything else the way goff defines it seems 
be a version of a consciousnessfirst monism thanks for this sean it was interesting to hear about panpsychism i 
thought if it as sort of a hippie cult from the and did not realize that it had been 
quite so seriously by academia this version at least as it is represented by goff has not changed my 
estimation it rather reminds me of creationism with its argument that such a complex and wonderful thing as consciousness 
not possibly have evolved on its own but must have been by some supernatural force that somehow modern science 
constrained to explain quantities and cannot handle qualities where did that come from what is it like to be 
experiencing red that must forever be a mystery that is like asking is it like to be a it 
be answered nor should we bother trying consciousness by definition is a brain mind if you like observing itself 
something else when you have a microphone listening to itself hearing a noise strange things happen like feedback it 
not be too surprising that a brain observing itself looking at something red might experience something more than information 
the wavelength of the light reaching the eye something something we might call qualia there we have just solved 
problem of consciousness nothing the laws of physics can not handle oh yes we might be able to take 
seriously when it comes up with a falsifiable hypothesis or two the more i listen to and read sean 
i seem to pick up on an emerging lesson to be learned if one disagrees with sean carroll on 
any subject he or she should probably just keep it to themself especially anything science related this guy is 
intellectual giant and he can easily destroy any opposing logic so effortlessly and he does it with humility and 
like a respectful human being i am almost convinced that this guy actually knows all the answers to the 
but only reveals them in small increments in this podcast i get the sense that in areas of disagreement 
philip is a little uncomfortable and tries to first direct the conversation into a joking disagreement mood with laughter 
of actually challenging difference of opinion sean would definitely be an interesting person to have an nonbroadcasted oneonone free 
with to hear his ideas on a lot of topics comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the 
most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts and ideas
