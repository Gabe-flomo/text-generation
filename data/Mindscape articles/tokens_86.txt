hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll today we have a special treat scott 
is an accomplished movie director writer and producer responsible for films such as the exorcism of emily rose sinister 
most recently the marvel movie doctor strange also an extremely thoughtful guy with strong ideas about the craft of 
the history of cinema and the relationship between movies and other art forms so we have a wideranging conversation 
basically falls into two parts the first thing we did was we sort of deconstructed the making of a 
blockbuster superhero movie using doctor strange as an example so we lay out the whole thing from the initial 
the meeting where you talk to studio and see if on the same wavelength through preproduction shooting reshoots and 
postproduction sc learn for example why the cast and crew especially benedict cumberbatch thought it was really important to 
on location in nepal and why digital photography is okay for most shots in a big movie like this 
why you have to switch to film once outside in the sunshine these are things that as a theoretical 
not generally up on so i really learned a lot from this conversation then in the second part talk 
broadly about the idea of cinema and film and what it means the role of themes and stories in 
many of films have been horror movies and we talk about the unique role of that particular genre and 
a certain kind of human reaction how that relates to the existence of evil and everyday human anxieties whether 
not you have supernatural boogeyman in your movie or not sc we also come from different perspectives about the 
nature of reality scott is a christian i am a naturalist and so we talk about how world view 
the story one tries to tell in a movie and scott says the answer is he says be a 
very different movie maker if he suddenly converted to atheism tomorrow but unlikely to happen we also agree though 
the world is more interesting with people coming from different perspectives so scott says he want me to convert 
his religious viewpoint only afterwards did i realized that maybe this means gonna be condemned to eternal damnation happily 
so sure about that and i even believe it myself so not really worried but one of the things 
you have to take into account when you talk about these big picture issues sc anyway this was truly 
great conversation sure gonna enjoy it remember that if so inclined you can support mindscape on patreon patreoncomseanmcarroll we 
our supporters thanks so much and whether a patreon pledger or not thanks very much for listening so go 
sc scott derrickson welcome to the mindscape podcast scott derrickson so good to be here thanks sc now i 
want to talk about big picture stuff themes in cinema and all these great things i know that you 
lots of opinions on but i thought set the stage and get into it by being a little bit 
down to earth so directed doctor strange sd yep sc big blockbuster marvel movie when i see movies like 
these days and we all see them one of the things is at the end of it the credits 
very very long sd yes sc a gigantic operation to shepherd something like this from start to finish that 
why you for the audience who are not necessarily cinephiles just explain what like from the initial pitch for 
idea to opening night sd for a movie that size from the original pitch to opening night is probably 
about two years for a movie of that size and the script process goes on for a good six 
nine months before what they call hard prep hard preproduction begins so always that six to nine month period 
getting the scripts written rewritten putting it in shape where breaking it down and getting it ready to shoot 
then that process for a movie this size always continues through prep and through production sc you never stop 
sd you never stop rewriting and by the way there are plenty of directors who work that way anyway 
kubrick reading the book about him and his relationship arthur c clarke and he was rewriting two thousand one 
the way through post he was just rewriting and publishing whole time sc my impression is his relationship with 
of the authors he adapted was touchy sd well yes especially given the fact that he said bad movies 
bad books make good i think that may have been a reason why the relationship was always touchy but 
was certainly i highly recommend that book by the way the relationship that the two of them had is 
fascinating and the book is really dense really wellresearched and i know a lot about that movie and i 
anything in that book but anyway so back to your question then got three major phases of filmmaking which 
preproduction i think the longest and most important phase because when really designing everything that will become the physical 
of the movie sc well actually i wanna pass too quickly over the pitch sd sure right right sc 
obviously doctor strange is a preexisting idea so a different kind of thing all sorts of different ways that 
can come about but did you have an angle on the movie and then go to marvel or did 
come to you and say do you wanna think about sd a good question what they did is they 
a pool of directors that in their minds were possibilities and it was a large pool dozens of directors 
they liked and at this point marvel was beginning its really big expansion which has taken place in just 
last few years and they had approached me years ago about thor and i just told them that i 
how to make thor into a movie sc not your superhero sd yeah not my superhero just to let 
know and i think any superhero that i would have felt personally drawn to except for doctor strange so 
i heard they were making doctor strange i felt immediately like this is something i could definitely do and 
way the process worked was they brought me in along with again dozens of other directors and they had 
short document sign an nda a nondisclosure agreement and you read this document and i was very impressed with 
document because the things that were in there were essentially what they felt should and be a doctor strange 
and it was very basic but it lined up perfectly with mine they really liked the deep ideas and 
philosophical overtones of the doctor strange comics there were aspects of the lovecraftian monsters that they interested in at 
in an early film and i was i felt like they understood the character this lonely isolated character who 
different than other superheroes because of his relationship to other dimensions not in a scientific sense but in the 
comic universe sense and that they were looking for a way to open up the mcu the marvel comic 
the marvel cinematic universe to a multiverse where actually dealing literally with other dimensions unlike asgard which is out 
in our own universe sc literally somewhere sd somewhere you can fly there if got a means to get 
sc i was actually part of the science advising for thor when it came out sd which was a 
aspect of that movie and i think because they did that so well in that movie i think that 
recognized that when it came to doctor strange it was okay to let magic be magic sc exactly and 
think that part of it was thor despite being a god in some sense gonna portray him as pretty 
we think a god super powerful but it has to make sense almost intentionally leaving the magic thing for 
in the series and where you could do it sd right because as much as i love and respect 
i think that an approach of trying to scientifically validate the mysticism of doctor strange would be interesting to 
and it would feel like a disrespect to the comics and sc on board sd the fact that not 
they were coming from was great so i immediately thought think the right guy to do this i felt 
real deep conviction about it and i decided that i would put everything i could into getting that job 
i just decided that i was going to work harder to try to get that job than anything i 
ever done before in terms of efforts to get hired for things this is obnoxious but said it publicly 
i spent fortytwo thousand dollars of my own money on a presentation sc wow sd which was the eighth 
eight meetings sc i bet you made it back you laughter sd well not only did i make it 
but one of the first things when they hired me is they said have to buy that presentation because 
need to own all that so that was that was my even before i had a directing deal i 
all that money back but it for me it was coming from a very personal place it so much 
i was excited to make a marvel movie but never been somebody been enamored by big budget filmmaking as 
to small budget filmmaking they all have their pros and cons as an artist to work on they all 
their pros and cons as films to watch but in this case i just felt like this is a 
that i think i could do better than maybe anyone else the right fit for this and that became 
focus was to show them why i was the right fit sc yeah sd yeah sc so you did 
and they picked you sd they did sc so then you can start this wonderful process that started and 
preproduction there was scripts being written and i presume a certain hollywood thing right where some people who get 
for the script but probably more voices that came in to sd yeah in this case there were the 
credited writers were jon spaihts who wrote the first draft a mutual friend of you you know him and 
was one that we picked based on his original screenplay for prometheus which was called i think alien engineers 
brilliant that screenplay was so good and i would been a fan his original script for passengers was brilliant 
we hired him so he did the first draft and then myself and cargill my writing partner here sitting 
me just listening in sc hi cargill robert cargill hi everybody sd cargill sc follow him on twitter he 
a great twitter feed sd yeah follow cargill on twitter here to pump twitter feed laughter sd but yeah 
came in and rewrote for quite a long time we must have done twenty drafts twentyfive drafts something like 
and then there were some other writers who came in and took passes on it to add humor to 
fixing some structural problems that we were having dan harmon did a quick pass on it there much that 
wrote that ended up in the script but his analysis of where we were having problems in the movie 
so spot on so he was actually a critical component in that movie eventually working sc finishing up writing 
book a popular book on quantum mechanics and i always send out my books to be read my drafts 
other people and sometimes they go like chapter three needs to be chapter like course why i think of 
yeah exactly and that so that whole process working with a budget this size is very common not so 
sometimes if working with a true auteur or director do everything on their own and it works out and 
it but i mind the process of working hand in hand of rewriting other scripts or having my scripts 
as long as the people are talented and i get along with them sc and meanwhile a million things 
on casting and the set design sd yes it all happens all at the same time sc right and 
you kind of the boss or partly the boss of all that sd yeah the captain of the ship 
so everything goes through you and everybody has to come to you for information about what looking for and 
give that information and a tremendous amount of delegating clearly but you ultimately are responsible as being the only 
holding it all together in your head sc yeah sd and a big part of that process becomes for 
on doctor strange in particular it was really two things i mean one of them was making it really 
to all the major department heads what the target of the movie was what it was that we were 
to be making and for me it was an emphasis upon is a mind bending mind trip action movie 
a sole personality about one guy overcoming himself getting past his own selfishness sc i mean at some at 
point the marvel cinematic universe is mature right sd right sc you have to look for ways to distinguish 
yes and you have to say is this is unlike these other films in this way but i do 
this for for example when it came to performances some marvel films are more over the top and cartoony 
comic bookey if i can use that phrase and for doctor strange because we were gonna be venturing out 
such fantastical terrain i actually wanted the performances to be very realistic so that was part of the casting 
which is why we got such serious actors to play pretty dramatic roles rachel mcadams and tilda swinton and 
ejiofor and you know these oscar winning people and of course benedict and probably you know that sensibility was 
that everyone needs to understand so as a director you have to make a certain basic vision of what 
movie is going to be clear to everybody so that they understand the sensibility behind it and i think 
helpful and then encourage my whole process for sure is encourage them to bring me better ideas than mine 
then they always do when good sc and are you doing a lot of recruiting of actors sometimes they 
the role really badly other times playing hard to get sd oh yeah no no no in the case 
the major roles for doctor strange we went after every one of those actors for specific reasons benedict was 
first choice we wanted him and we talked about other possibilities for a very short time but kevin feige 
runs marvel you really make the movie with him not just a studio head he is very hands on 
in there with you without a lot of middle men and he and i quickly agreed that he was 
right guy and i flew to london immediately and met with benedict and the timing work out because he 
doing hamlet in london and so then i had to start looking for other actors and nothing i mean 
met with amazing actors but in the end it was just like gotta be benedict and kevin to his 
went for the second time back to disney and said really want benedict so we need to move the 
so we moved the release date from the summer sc a huge deal sd a huge deal because the 
is not as lucrative just not and so we probably could have made even more money in terms of 
day and that sorta thing but we have made the movie that we made because so centered around benedict 
and at the same time deciding what the sets are going to look like i remember i know if 
saw this little video you can find on youtube the russo brothers did a video about infinity war they 
analyzed a little thirty second scene right and it was where thor appears with the guardians of the galaxy 
a great scene but it just impresses on someone like me who is not in the business how much 
goes into those thirty seconds with the lighting coming from particular ways and the postures of every actor and 
things gonna do and this is all going in your mind in this preproduction phase right sd yeah yeah 
and the break down of all the different elements that have to go into how to shoot those particular 
and this is why the preproduction phase is the most critical phase because gotta have enough time first of 
to dream it up and then to thrash it and criticize it in your mind and think about what 
be better i think one of the main reasons why so many big blockbuster movies are not great is 
you have enough money to afford your first idea sc a good point sd and your first idea is 
your best idea and so it takes a real conscious discipline to come up with these ideas but then 
be very harsh and critical of them and to their credit i think one of the things that marvel 
better than anybody they they are not ever impressed with their own work and so everything is always being 
by everybody all the time which as the director can become a little painful at times laughter but sc 
like being a scientist actually sd no the same idea which is if you want to get to the 
version of something or to the truth of something or to an ideal of some kind not going to 
there without admitting to all your shortcomings and all your failures and all the things that actually work and 
line up and true of writing as well the phrase that we would always use in working on doctor 
between myself and cargill and particularly john spades was doing a lot of hand waving in the scene and 
hand waving all pretending like this works in a way it actually work sc literally what physicists say to 
other hand waving this this particular question right sd yeah yes and the same thing and because so much 
film making i love the fact that the academy is the academy of arts and sciences because there is 
much of what in service of is art but so much of the actual making of a movie is 
so much of it is just physical practical and even down to things in the case of doctor strange 
this gets still to your initial question about communicating with department heads one of the things that i was 
about from the beginning that was probably the hardest concept to get across to people was that we were 
have these incredible fantastical sequences of the mind trip through multidimension multiple dimensions and new york being turned into 
escheresque puzzle and people fighting in their astro forms all that but my mantra was want the physical materials 
what is on screen the physical material that the audience is looking at to feel tactile and real and 
they can relate as opposed to say amorphous lightning bolt finger like we have a reference for anything that 
like that in our experience lightning is sharper edged than that sc yeah sd even tesla light is more 
so i was always coming back to that no amorphous no no i wanna represent magic as being this 
want it to so for example when they create the mantras very crispy sparkly material that looks like the 
you grew up playing with and looks like fire and look you feel like you have a sense of 
it would feel like to touch that material sc right so you wanted the distance between this crazy magic 
and our human experience to be as short as possible sd exactly because i think that as soon as 
you try to merge if you try to communicate i felt and i still feel that if you try 
communicate magic with physical representations that have no human context in terms of their tactile your visual tactile relationship 
them in your own mind then using something unrelatable to try to communicate something unrelatable and i really feel 
the best way to get the audience to feel a sense of awe is if showing them something unrelatable 
everything actually in the frame has a physical relatability to their experience like that was a and i mean 
took me several minutes just to try to get the concept across to you and you can see how 
difficult thing than to get across to a farm of fifty visual effects operators we know get sc well 
it the same thing where saying about the first idea is not the best one in this cgi ready 
maybe too easy to just make some amorphous lightning bolts do all the work sd exactly right exactly right 
it was a constant struggle to reject things and i think that at times it was very frustrating for 
visual effects people because they used to that kind of scrutiny and i was pointing them i was saying 
these things that are so fantastical and no done it before and no precedent for the visual thing that 
but it it look unreal sc right laughter sd sc a tough challenge so they would script this right 
sd yeah so it was but but they did really get behind it i think that once once i 
to communicate that at a deep enough level something sort of kicked in and it was it was industrial 
and magic and a company called luma and a couple of others the head people who were working on 
project for those companies became very excited at the prospect and suddenly realized that they were going to get 
create some things that were gonna be boundary pushing for sc right and a message sd and what you 
you want them to get excited that they get to be cocreators that they get to i wanted them 
bring me things that superseded my ideas but i kept kicking them back because it was not that kind 
magic not i it has to feel physically tactile to the audience gotta have some way of relating to 
piece of visual material looking at sc okay and some point production starts there you are where did you 
what was the first thing you did sd the first thing we did is nepal we shot in kathmandu 
nepal and we had gone there three times i think we did an early scout there before the big 
and then the earthquake occurred and we did a second scout and there was a real question about safety 
working there because if another quake happened and it there were huge piles of rubble everywhere and some of 
sets that we had picked were destroyed sc wow who knew sd so it was but it was a 
major decision and benedict to his credit sort of led the charge in saying that we have to shoot 
now like we have to like they need it they they need to nepal to be represented because you 
a third world country and tourism is one of the primary sources of income and tourism just vanished after 
earthquake and he really felt like this is a special place he had a history there he had been 
when he was younger and he said have to shoot here now because a moral good and find a 
to make it all and everybody got behind that it was great yeah sc yeah and how long does 
actual shooting take overall sd with the marvel movie shooting days are usually around eighty to eightyfive days which 
not much i sc i was gonna tell i was going to ask does it feel rushed sd yes 
yeah sd but they have they have very good reasons for doing it i think because i think for 
my first assistant director who had just come off spectre the james bond movie that movie was one hundred 
shooting days and i made doctor strange in like and but what it does is when you know that 
production time is so compressed it just makes everybody raise their game because when you get the reality of 
schedule in front of you and you realize on on this week we have to accomplish all of this 
works harder and i think that there is a lot of truth it was orson welles who said absence 
boundaries is the enemy of and i really believe true which you need i think a measure of pressure 
limitation in order to facilitate the highest measure of creativity sc i think robert frost had the famous quote 
you know would he ever write free verse and he says like playing tennis without a right laughter sc 
fun anymore sd right right exactly so and i think that a real method to approach to that but 
also work with the understanding that almost certainly going to be a sizeable amount of reshooting sc i was 
ask so i presume doing some special effects work while shooting there must be an enormous amount of effort 
to put together what shot are you shooting digitally sd yeah well we actually in kathmandu we shot all 
that on film i am a big believer in digital photography not just the future here like what everybody 
on with the exception of a few auteurs like tarantino and chris nolan who can afford to shoot all 
their films on actual film but yet to see still daylight exteriors look great on digital i just think 
exteriors have a quality even the best work that seen still has a quality that pales so to film 
so we do we i did was able to convince everybody that we need to shoot kathmandu sc an 
science question because no reason in principle why it look as good just two different ways of recording photons 
on your detector somehow sd yeah and but i sc something about film i agree something that makes it 
more real sd it makes it feel more real and i think that it has to do with our 
of the specificities of sunlight and again like cloud cover if a cloud covered day like we did digital 
on sinister and thank god there was cloud cover when we shot those because they look great sc right 
it all looks great that that the differential between film and digital when it comes to cloud cover days 
in my opinion negligible not that important but daylight exteriors when dealing with sunlight on faces or shooting the 
sky itself the difference is enormous i mean so enormous that for me it always pulls me out of 
movie when looking at digital daylight exteriors they just feel real sc and when you start with the reshoots 
the reshoots it was planned in presumably to the schedule and is it mostly because you say the scene 
or we could do it better what makes you go do a reshoot sd well what you do is 
put the movie together and most of the visual effects are not being done yet because you want to 
the movie in relatively good shape before you start building all those visual elements so the postproduction process is 
you build most of the effects so a lot of green screen in that first cut and what you 
need to do is get it together and get it in front of people quickly and whether at first 
people ten people and then get a small little inhouse crew of fifty strangers to watch it and you 
learn very soon and sc like it or not sd what work and what does work and what work 
you get a good idea of what our problems and that begins the process of you immediately start to 
what are we gonna need to to be different to solve some of these now occasionally even a big 
like a marvel movie need much of that i believe they only did a few days of reshoots for 
avengers for the first avengers that movie just came in everything worked rare even for a small independent film 
mean we did no reshoots on sinister that we need them rare it was a three dollars million movie 
on doctor strange we definitely did but we also knew that we would because we knew that we were 
with certain things still in the screenplay while we were making it and the surprising thing is what does 
that you think would work and what work that you assumed would work you know sc interesting yeah sd 
illuminating i think film making is a bit like baking where if a chef and especially if a world 
chef you are an expert at understanding i put these ingredients together and i but you gotta do that 
you gotta do it sd you gotta do it the first time but once and film making is like 
a recipe for the first time and you know so many things about how gonna work but then it 
into the oven and what comes out is gonna come out sd you know what i mean and when 
comes out gonna come out and surprise you in some way it might be way better than you thought 
probably will not be as good as you thought sc had some dishes in fancy restaurants that clearly should 
been tasted before they came out yeah sd yeah so a component of i think you put all the 
in you make all the hard choices you do try to in your mind as a director made a 
film visualized everything you see it all but then when the actual thing is there you have to come 
realize the things that work sc and then how much time is spent between the end of the reshoots 
the opening night sd we had a very short post production schedule sc the score and visual effects sd 
because of schedule and having moved it to the fall we had a long prep which again i think 
the most important thing but we had a short post and the result was a kind of crazed panic 
we had to get all those reshoots done and get the visual effects done on time my visual effects 
was so smart in that they hired multiple houses big houses to all start work at the same time 
you usually really do you usually rely heavily on a single house a single visual effects house so that 
for us i think it was only like four months typically gonna be more like six or seven months 
and a deadline that is not fungible staring at you in the face sd yeah oh yeah movies this 
work from their release dates backwards you start the process reverse engineering from the day that the gonna come 
sc are you fiddling with it right up to the last second sd the film sc yeah sd let 
put it this way my final work on doctor strange was at around or in the morning when i 
color timing which is the last thing you do you finish the actual color timing of the master print 
that when you watch it when you watch the finished color timing version the finished movie the sound is 
mixed done all the work there is to do finished it i finished that at at night and was 
a plane at six that morning so five and a half hours later i was on a plane to 
kong to start the press junket sd so yes i was literally working sc was it all on thumbdrive 
mean where was this movie sd yeah well this was all on the disney lots and all it was 
in the studios and we really unusual the degree to which we just needed every last second and when 
was working seven days a week and eighteen hour days for months sc no time for podcasting sd no 
for podcasting yeah sd and exhausting but very exhilarating because that post process is the most fun sc is 
sd oh yes just editing all post production is so much fun sc do all directors believe that or 
different directors think differently sd i think that most directors probably prefer editing to i think i think the 
of us feel that way because you get to see all the work come together another phase of writing 
getting to write the movie and as creative as writing definitely more creative in my opinion than production but 
is the worst production is just grueling just sc production in the sense of making sure the craft services 
paid and stuff or what does sd no production meaning just working those long hours and the what people 
understand about making a movie this size is the physical toll that it takes the physical demand on you 
pretty extraordinary sc yeah sd i mean you really do they have people compare it to war which is 
most ridiculous now sc probably too far sd yeah yeah we eat we crap we eat catered food and 
in warm beds every night and getting paid huge amounts of money but sc relatively few casualties sd and 
dies but just like war but it is like it is kinda like joining the army it is that 
sc boot camp yeah sd boot camp just brutal this is not for the faint of heart and you 
do have to watch what you eat and drink and manage your sleep habits because if you the moving 
that running in front of will mow you over sc well why i can imagine personally writing a movie 
someday i can never even imagine directing a movie it just sounds like so much stuff is going on 
must take a very special kinda personality to say what i wanna do i wanna be in a thing 
so many different failure modes that could go wrong around sd yes sc and i wanna live with that 
this what you wanted to do from the start sd yeah it is for me it was and i 
still is a two fold thing part of it is just i have a talent for it i have 
knack for it and i think i felt that that was going to be the case when i was 
in high school just putting together a little super eight films and stuff like that i just felt like 
had a knack for understanding film language and i grew up in a family that watched so many movies 
i understood movies in a way that i think people my age typically or at least then i think 
much more common you know people are watching so many films growing up sc right sd but i think 
what i love about directing but the actual experience of directing is to do everything in the service of 
piece of artistic entertainment gonna be seen by millions of people and to feel the responsibility of get to 
a couple of hours of their hardearned life their rest time their hardearned money is gonna be spent on 
friday night to go with their girlfriend or wife or family whatever and watch this i want them to 
the best time of their week sc right sd and always there and i want them to have something 
i want them to have a human experience and have fun and be amazed by it and i want 
to remember it and possibly watch it again and love it as a part of their life you know 
so you start with that and the goal what in service of a some real altruistic i think truth 
that but then in the action of actually doing it the satisfaction for me is that it demands usage 
every single thing good at like my ability to communicate my leadership skills my salesmanship you know sd along 
my love for film language my understanding of cinema history my ability to write all to be able to 
and feel like in a profession where you are utilizing everything that you are really good at all being 
at the highest level the ultimate job for anyone yeah sc fulfilling in that sense sd fulfilling in that 
flannery was asked do you write these quirky little stories about freaks the short stories about and her answer 
good at laughter and i just thought that should be answer sc the job you want yeah sd that 
be answer to why they do what they do because if good at it and you love it your 
what you should do sc and you have to do it though within this framework we call hollywood right 
us a little bit about your fitting in with the whole hollywood superstructure movies are obviously a big part 
it but business is a big part of it egos are a big part of it and so forth 
yeah well i think that been fortunate because managed to work for a lot of difficult people and even 
who are notoriously difficult within hollywood i worked for the weinsteins for years and i think that i survived 
lot of the people i worked for in the past and survived in a way a lot of artist 
a lot of good artists so i think that my survival skills are strong there was that but i 
that it was also my ability to sell my dad was a car dealer sc oh i know that 
yeah my dad owned a couple of car dealerships when i was in high school he got sick and 
all of his money when i was in college but i worked as a car salesman for him and 
credited my work as a car salesman i think my talent as a filmmaker is what it is but 
think that my ability to navigate the waters of hollywood and to actually put together a career and to 
working has so much to do with my ability to sell because always selling an idea selling a script 
pitch selling yourself to your crew members selling yourself to the studios to get jobs selling yourself in marketing 
movie such a big part of the job sc getting actors to listen to you and you tell them 
do something sd for sure and by the way so much of that so much of what make makes 
an effective director was understanding that in sales you come to understand you talk to every customer the same 
your job is to figure out who are they how do they need to be communicated with because your 
and so actors or the same way all powerfully emotional people but they all need to be spoken to 
different ways depending on who they are and so you have to learn to do that and i think 
think so much of hollywood success demands either incredible luck just unparalleled raw genius or an ability to sell 
right two of those three would be helpful sd yeah if you have two of those three then in 
good shape then stanley kubrick sc yeah right so you have done the big block buster super hero actually 
i leave that topic how hard is it to keep the humanity the narrative strength in a movie that 
just that big with effects and so forth sd really glad that you asked that question because i think 
it is the greatest challenge of directing a film that big and i think that the number one reason 
you see big hollywood blockbuster movies that work because a lot of times worked in a script phase in 
way that they work by the time they reach the screen and so often what i can feel from 
movies is that the director was not able for whatever reason maybe it was his fault maybe not or 
fault but that for some reason that human emotional story was not remaining central during the production because the 
was so demanding and in making doctor strange i was determined that would not be the way that movie 
fail sd there were plenty of ways for it to fail but i was like feel it felt that 
and what i literally had to do was i created a document for every shooting day that just for 
shooting day that was on the movie that had the central emotional narrative story points for this character because 
knew that when i was shooting it that all of my time would be spent talking to people about 
issues and where the camera goes and how we can get this done on time and all of that 
so easy to lose that because you have time to be working through that much on a movie of 
size and so every day i would go in and then i would remind myself what is i would 
by reading at the top of my script what i just pitched to you sc yeah sd a psychotropic 
it was psychotropic mind trip action movie about one man overcoming himself just to remind myself what making sc 
sd and then to really focus on that with the characters and really understand the emotional quality of what 
guy and the people around him are going through and i never lost sight of that while making doctor 
and the reason why so important is people pay to go see these movies because they see the trailer 
they see the spectacle and they love marvel whatever but when they get in there the reason it works 
because of an emotional connection to those actors sc yeah sd always the sealing for how good a movie 
be a movie cannot be better than your lead story and performance impossible it matter how great everything else 
if your lead character and performance are not emotionally satisfying the not good if that is satisfying amazing how 
things can cannot work and the movie will still work for you and sc and i saw you push 
the release date to get benedict cumberbatch in your movie yeah sd yeah precisely you know because he just 
a quality that i felt for this particular character that he would be able to cover the range of 
and the cockiness and the arrogance and still maintain likeability he is such a prick in the beginning of 
movie as he was in the comics sc he being stephen strange not benedict cumberbatch sd yeah no no 
being stephen strange benedict is lovely i love him really genuinely a great guy but yeah so you gotta 
the right actors in those roles and then you gotta stay focused on that and sc do you think 
yourself as mostly a storyteller is that your task or is it something broader than that sd i think 
think broader than that because i think cinema is broader than that i do think that a story itself 
important because the story says something that only a story can okay it what makes a good story a 
story is that it be reduced to something else it can what it is communicating can only be communicated 
that story so you have to be a good storyteller but i think for me and this is how 
feel about movies i watch as well as the movies i make cinema is something broader than just that 
major component perhaps even the spinal column of the animal of the movie but the flesh and blood of 
is something to me that is more artful and ineffable that a quality a dreamlike quality to the cinema 
of submitting yourself to the immersion in this alternate reality that supersedes the that supersedes the art forms of 
music and photography and blocking theater and the storytelling of literature because it is a combination of all those 
and the end result is still greater than the sum of its parts sc are you a fan of 
theater also sd not really no and i think the sc i sense that by what you were saying 
sd yeah no i really very hard on theater because i find the experience so limiting compared to cinema 
would much rather watch rather watch a mediocre movie than a good play but a great play can certainly 
an experience unlike anything else when i saw hamilton for example like this is one of the great works 
art of the last one hundred and i experienced it and understood why but i think that cinema is 
kind of experience that is as close to dreamlike magic that we get when it comes to art and 
sc i think that different i was just in london a couple of weeks ago and we got to 
ian michelin as king lear at the duke of theatre right and so it was an interesting experience not 
fantastic but because you are familiar with him from movies sd right sc and now twenty feet away from 
being king lear and things that obviously a live theater performance cannot do that cinema can but i think 
versa also right and i think that maybe comparing them is wrong i just thought of it because you 
talking about the history a little bit and i think of cinemas coming out of live theatre back in 
day sd for sure sc but had a one hundred some years to develop and able to do things 
that live theater even imagine sd yeah and i think that the theater that i do enjoy tends to 
more minimalistic i will always enjoy a good shakespeare play because some of the greatest writing in human history 
if well made and well acted going to be an extraordinary experience no matter what so what i like 
a spectacle theatre sc yeah sd and part of was one of the reasons why i liked hamilton because 
i love just entering in and seeing oh this is just an empty stage and there was a pretty 
back drop and the experience was the music the movement these things that are inherently theatrical when it came 
step on toes but like see the big phantom a chandelier hovering over the audience i just think ridiculous 
cheesy sd and yeah like i can pay eight dollars in a at a movie matinee and see something 
thousand times greater than this right now sc and do you think that gives that immersive quality cinema gives 
this particular art form a way to get and connect with emotions and you have sort of a visceral 
that other methods sd i do i do i think that it is primarily emotional i think and i 
that it is holistically emotional i think that hard for me to describe it because i usually have to 
there is a soulful holistic emotional quality to the cinema experience that i do believe transcends the nature of 
experience of any other individual kind of art and it speaks to our subconscious in a way that other 
forms and especially directors who are aware of that and can utilize that well i just think that the 
art form and only because the amalgam of all the other great art forms the amalgam of photography and 
and theater and music and when all those things come together into something that is pure and creates a 
experience the emotional power of it can be overwhelming and for me even a bad movie has a quality 
that that i still prefer and the closest thing to i think probably music in the way that it 
move you and transcend your experience and an avid reader so no disrespect for literature or formal art sc 
in this approach it makes perfect sense when you say that that one of your favorite genres would be 
horror movie right it has a kind of connection you see that many horror plays right laughter sd hard 
get scared in a play because you need the intimacy of being lost within your own imagination or within 
own fears and certainly horror literature works great sc right sd you know good a good scary stephen king 
scares you you know but not in the same way that a horror movie does you usually read even 
great chapter in the shining and physically feel your pulse race as you do in a good horror film 
you get actually really scared and and i think that cinema can do that this is this is something 
gonna add in here while on this subject because talking about the nature of movies themselves and like what 
movies and i think one of the real clues to what makes movies special is the categorization of movies 
got action movies horror movies dramas comedies thrillers and then got things like documentaries sc romcom sd science fiction 
that sc romcoms sd yeah yeah but those yeah still in the comedy section sc okay sd a brand 
under the comedy banner this major categories the same now on netflix as always were in blockbuster and i 
this revelation one day when i was i think a a film student and i was going into a 
video somewhere and i was looking at them and then i it the thought hit me who created these 
who created these categories this these have been the categories that known movies to be under my whole life 
the more i thought about it i thought well the audience created these categories the audience by wanting to 
these different kinds of movies that separated into these like seven or eight major categories and when i realized 
is what they really are is the major categories of human emotion fear for horror comedy for laughter joy 
for sorrow for deeper feelings the visceral excitement is action anxiety is thriller and i think science fiction has 
always built upon a sense of wonder a wonderment combined usually with some other genre and i think that 
this is these speaking to these basic human emotions is the nature of cinema just what i just what 
do sc so an obvious question like to get your take on why do people go to horror movies 
do they wanna be scared why would you actually pay money for someone to make you feel unpleasant in 
sense sd a lot of people and i think that the people who do they like it for the 
reason they like roller coasters the powerful feeling of fear which i think is arguably the most powerful human 
and to to experience the visceral power of that emotion in environment where you know safe like in a 
coaster you know not going to fly out of the car but you feel like gonna fly out of 
car and so experiencing the adrenaline rush of that and then for people who are serious horror fans and 
like me who consider it one of the undervalued great forms of movie art that it gets to some 
the most important human questions about good and evil about metaphysics the questions of the after life and the 
of existence and how unspoken and unspeakable fears can be tapped into by great horror sd these are these 
things that i love i waxing poetic about it because i do i love it i love it and 
revere it and i think important but i also completely understand and have nothing negative to say and some 
who just like that and so if somebody like that experience they like it and by the way perhaps 
spent my entire adult life making horror films there is no such thing as a horror type like met 
of the bravest cops in new york city who are terrified to watch a horror movie and would never 
it guys who dragged people out of the towers on sc yeah sd and have risked their lives over 
over again and just like show me any of that and then meet a little old lady in a 
shop seen every nightmare on elm street movie laughter they just love them sc something human well hard to 
what it is that people like sd yeah very hard to predict sc but i do wanna get into 
metaphysical presuppositions i think for you questions of evil and the purpose and meaning in life come into why 
do horror but maybe also why you do other movies also sd why sc and we disagree about the 
presuppositions need disagreement okay sc we do we one of the things that one of the things loved about 
relationship is that spoken about this many times we have very differing views of the nature of existence itself 
always admired and appreciated the other point of view and respect the fact that both of those views are 
personal and powerful to us as individuals they inform everything else that we do in our work and the 
we think about everything from practical life politics right down to the meaning of our own life and for 
i do think that everything that done perhaps the through line in all of the work that done including 
of the script work on things that have not been produced is a combination of this sort of love 
genre for horror thriller action type scifi movies and some kind of cross over into metaphysical questions questions about 
nature of human existence and the possibilities of what life could be and certainly the moral questions that arise 
of the interesting things to me about horror is very difficult to make an amoral horror film or a 
horror film sc going to be a moral one way or the other sd the movie even if it 
to have no moral center that becomes a moral point sc well good and evil are out there right 
it or not sd good and evil are out there and so once dealing in horror landing in terrain 
is inherently so philosophical inescapable and i think inescapable in a way that not in other genres and so 
think that it was a big part of the poll too that and the fact that a lot of 
to improve the genre and has been in my life and really watched it happen and watching it happen 
sc more sophistication now sd i think that horror in the in the and was just slasher all anybody 
thought about but with the exception of master works by great non horror directors like kubrick making the shinning 
friedkin making the exorcist or something like that but i think that now a genre that has gained a 
of respect for how it comments on the human experience sc yeah i remember i loved sinister and i 
it was extremely scary and not an aficionado by any means but since then the babadook is an amazingly 
movie and just now started watching the haunting of hill house sd we were just talking about that on 
way here we saw well and by the way we saw that of the and i asked cargill i 
have you heard anything he said hear very and mike flanagan i tweeted about the release of that yesterday 
i seen it yet but he is such a good director sc so good sd and so talented and 
course read the book the shirley jackson novel is amazing and really scary sc yeah sd which goes back 
the original haunting by robert wise which was a great movie and now these kind of tales regardless of 
cosmological view and regardless of your philosophical presuppositions about the existence of the immaterial world or the existence of 
non material these movies speak to our fears they just do the otherness of them sc and in a 
like that and in the in movies made obviously a supernatural element but the response of the human characters 
what seeing is what it would be right sd right sc what counts i would totally feel this way 
this circumstance which i believe will ever happen because an atheist but yeah sc if it did how i 
feel what matters right sd oh yeah and funny because i think that even if right and wrong about 
nature of the universe the likelihood of something coming along in the course of history that undoes all of 
safe assumptions about the nature of the world is going to be frightening that like that encountering that will 
scary sc exactly sd and i think i think one of my favorite things i remember hearing you talk 
is how these sort of big revelations in science are typically nonintuitive sc yeah right sd and relativity i 
what could be more nonintuitive than relativity and it takes so much effort just to try to conceptualize and 
what that even is and the fact that somebody figured it out to me is still incredible i still 
how that happened sc and honestly quantum mechanics is a one hundred times worse the opening line of my 
book is i hope is right now something like need a phd in theoretical physics to be afraid of 
mechanics but it sd oh see great and i just think that it all gets back to the mystery 
the unknown and i think that something where you and i have always had an unspoken overlapping respect which 
a lot that we know but so much that we know and so much still out there to surprise 
sc yeah right sd and so much of the human experience not just when it comes to knowledge and 
we know and what we believe about the universe but our daytoday experience life surprises us sc right sd 
it scares us and it does it throws us these curve balls and i think that this particular realm 
visual storytelling is a great way to reckon with those fears sc yeah sc and made a couple of 
about exorcisms sd yeah sc and correct me if wrong but you think that this is a real thing 
i mean that it is at least plausible say possession sd well well the funny i expect you to 
that up but now that you have really glad you did because what i can say about it is 
the primary word i would use to describe my own feeling about the phenomenon is mystery a great mystery 
it but possession and exorcism is a fact an anthropological reality that exists in all cultures and always have 
get into these crazy mindsets and start doing these things with certain predictable patterns and then this kind of 
therapy ritual that every culture has developed that is often very effective and so for me the starting point 
starting point of what makes it so interesting theological anthropological sc right sd you know that this is a 
this is something that happens and in sc no one can deny that in the real world exorcists go 
houses because they believe that they are possessed and things happen sd precisely and i think that and read 
of books on the subject and including very skeptical books and i think at the very least you have 
you look at credible cases when i say credible i mean well researched well analyzed cases and certainly when 
look at it as a phenomenon globally and historically i do think there is a trance state quality of 
in the more extreme cases of what i would call a legitimate case is it the very least that 
right sd and there in you are entering into something very mysterious about the human mind at the very 
sc yeah sd and so i found that compelling and when i first made exorcism of emily i have 
open and liberal enough view of scripture for example and in my own theological views of things and always 
myself to question what i believe one of the reasons i went into that was to see if do 
believe that anything behind this do i believe that the devil exists is it all just a construct and 
that particular case what was so fascinating was by the time it was over i have any more answers 
i went into going in because there really seem to be any simple way to explain what happened to 
particular sc right sd in that case like no matter what angle i looked at it from it was 
confounding and why it sparked so much interesting conversation but i will finish by saying that i think that 
vast majority of what you see and hear out there people attributing to being demon possession and the work 
the devil is nonsense like the vast majority of it is absolutely ridiculous and in the more extreme cases 
could be wrong maybe all some kind of psychological trancestate but i personally do i believe that a spiritual 
behind it i do sc yeah and no well very little question i guess always some question but it 
to be useful in describing human actions to believe in the existence of evil some things just are evil 
yeah sc and and a lot of evil going on in your films how would your films be different 
tomorrow you became a naturalist sd oh a really good question sc and this obviously is not explicit sd 
a really really really good question i like to question a lot i mean it would be completely different 
they would be made from a completely different human experience my spirituality if honest has been certainly scrutinized intellectually 
certainly take philosophy very seriously i have changed a lot of what i believe because of critical thinking and 
of that but if honest my core belief system is born of my experience i raised in a religious 
but it has always been my nature from the time i was a small child to look around and 
the world as something that is much more than the material in front of me always felt that the 
that what was real was more than this and maybe what was primary was more than this it was 
else not even more but just something else that always experienced the world more immaterially than i have materially 
just been my way of experiencing it and so i connect that that part of myself that experiences the 
in that mystical kind of way i relate to cinema as a part of that i relate to film 
as a viewer and as an artist is very very connected to that so i think and when it 
to philosophy where you would land much more with hume gonna land much more with crazy kant sc oh 
sorry the deal breaker and i know if we can get along anymore after that sd yeah sorry i 
but right with him when he says two things sure about the stars above me and the moral law 
sc yeah sd and so i think that i do think that that belief in a moral law preexisting 
human behavior or something i do believe in but if i were to become a naturalist and undo even 
i i feel like suddenly this when you asked me that question the honest answer is well i make 
of the movies that made at all wiped the slate clean and what would i make have to live 
another life and if that and by the way possible that something could happen that would make me think 
way and what would the result be i think that all i could make movies about if that happened 
me at this point in my life all i could make movies about art was that sc is that 
sd sc such a profound thing sd about the shock value of experiencing life for so long as in 
powerfully for five decades and then to suddenly have the rug pulled out from under you you know sc 
i think perfectly fair and vice versa if i had a conversion experience sd yeah oh my god what 
you gonna do sc i would not be able to write about quantum mechanics anymore and it would be 
most important in your life right sd and this makes me such a bad christian too because i hear 
say that and like god i hope that happen to laughter absolutely i like sean the way he is 
the world is more interesting with the variety right yeah sd exactly right sc no not trying to convert 
other a good thing but it i think that the relationship with mystery is an interesting thing you brought 
up mystery is crucially important to all movies sd yeah sc to all storytelling to human existence etcetera etcetera 
was really annoyed by the famous jj abrams mystery box ted talk did you see his ted talk sd 
i did i did see it sc and part of it and maybe being unfair but part of it 
to and maybe disagree about this that he was saying that mysteries are better if are better best only 
if you even try to solve them in some sense if you assume that not solvable and keep them 
mysteries and to me mysteries are great because they can be solved i go through life presuming that of 
a million questions i know the answers to and i will die before i know all the answers to 
but in principle i could get them and what makes the quest worthwhile sd well certainly when talking about 
mysteries of the material world and the mysteries of science a given what we know about dark matter and 
energy and these things and gravity these things that science is still chasing of course we have to believe 
they can be answered that those mysteries can be answered and just as relativity changed our human experience of 
world and sure future discoveries and quantum mechanics is already starting to do that as it seeps out into 
culture starting to affect the way that we feel a lot of times in very sloppy ways and stories 
know but i think that when talking about mystery the mystery of human experience and the mystery of say 
mystery of god of the concept of god the mystery of meaning to me always a quest to comprehend 
always a quest to get deeper underneath it that is the point i believe that power in just acknowledging 
mystery never well if the case i need to think about it i i remember where i first heard 
but repeated it before maybe i said sd i really remember but certainly something i think about a lot 
is that to me the concept of mystery is not the presence of something meaningless but the presence of 
meaning than we can yet comprehend that an awareness of more here than we can get our experience or 
brains or our hearts around and the whole point of evolving as a species evolving as an individual is 
get deeper into that mystery start to understand it just there what is what is it therefore and i 
that the important thing to me though that is worth protecting and i particularly agree with approach on the 
box either but what i do believe with respect to mystery is that we have to make a practiced 
of discipline to not think that we understand more than we do i think sc oh yeah sure sd 
think really important and i think important because i and said this many times before but i think both 
and religion have been guilty and have continued to be guilty of propagating the idea that we understand a 
more than we really understand and both done it in very different ways but broadcasting a sensibility to their 
that we got the world figured out sc well one of the terrible things about the way that we 
kids sciences is that we teach it as a set of facts that learned rather than as a process 
making hypotheses and then testing them against reality sd that statement alone is something that people understand sc yeah 
people think of science as a process they sc not that hard they could do it better sd they 
of is irrevocable fact it well and sometimes it is revoked sc oh yeah exactly to anyone who knows 
history sd exactly the whole history of science has been a process of it undercutting itself as it gets 
into it understanding of how complex the world really is sc alright we can move into the lightning round 
know that you have to go to see your horror house right sd yes yeah meeting my kids at 
then going gonna go to the warner brothers horror tour sc very consistent sd yes sc excellent in philosophical 
but then very quickly i do wanna talk not just a director but you are a lover of cinema 
the history of cinema what is your relationship to that history and what would you recommend to our listeners 
there in podcast land should they download kurosawa on netflix sd such a great question my relationship to it 
that i first learned movies from my father primarily he was a movie lover but he was straight genre 
horror either but he just loved action movies he loved thrillers and so i grew up seeing tons of 
american movies we see two three movies a day sometimes in our family sc great sd and so i 
a real love for movies and then of course when video technology came in i started to rewatch movies 
the time but then when i got to college i was exposed to international cinema and it was really 
discovery of the art of international cinema that made me really wanna be a filmmaker because the first time 
i saw eight i i actually had a panic attack at the end of the movie the density of 
experience the dream quality of that film was so overwhelming i kinda panicked i had literally left the classroom 
i sc immersive experience sd i understand what was happening to me in my brain in this experience and 
as i continued to rewatch it the layers of meaning and poetry in that movie were so amazing i 
like can do and so that sent me really down the rabbit hole of exploring all the major movements 
world cinema starting in the silent era in american cinema going all the way through the various major movements 
it was primarily japanese cinema and european art cinema the french new wave and italian realism these things really 
to me and kurosawa is a great point for people who have limited exposure to international cinema was a 
starting point because he took i think the sensibility of hollywood movies the entertainment value of hollywood movies and 
it with the artfulness of european movies of his time he was as much a fan of john ford 
he was of ingmar bergman and so a quality to his movies that are high art and high entertainment 
the same time that you really get with many directors ever and so a great starting point watch just 
ten best kurosawa and every one of them will be a masterpiece worth watching sd but you also have 
find directors that you love like godard jeanluc godard is not for everybody but for those of us who 
those moves or bergman bergman you and i it was so interesting i would love to watch a bergman 
with you because he really believed in a godless universe he believed in no god or if there is 
god it is certainly silent certainly noncommunicative we are alone and even though never held that view i experience 
experience of the world through those movies so powerfully and this is what movies can do i think again 
ways that other art forms is they well other art forms do the same thing but for me movies 
it in a way nothing else does i feel that experience i feel like his human experience through those 
and i am made more human for having felt it and for having understood it and having related to 
truth quality in it because even though i have a system of belief that is different than that i 
what like to feel alone in the world i know what like to not feel safe in the world 
i know certainly what like to be wracked with doubt which a lot of his films were about as 
sc and i think something that we both agree on and probably bergman would agree with us is that 
question of whether or not god exists matters sc it quite sd exactly exactly no i think exactly right 
i think that we live in an age now of just shouting people everybody shouting at each other and 
of the things i love is being able to have conversations like this and hear something like that from 
like you that that question is an important question a profound question one of the essential questions and it 
to be reckoned with now and more important than to me hearing that is a much more important voice 
anybody advocating why they believe what they believe you know the starting point is we all need to deal 
certain realities we have to answer certain questions if we are to live a full life an enlightened life 
should we should we should have an understanding of what we think the human experience really is sc okay 
more questions the lightning round for whatever reason told that you can make one more movie ever in your 
what would it be allowed to change your mind later sd it would be the next movie that going 
make but i say anything about it sc fair sd is that a safe answer robert cargill that is 
correct answer sd that is the correct answer made everybody happy gonna make a good sc yeah no and 
living the life sd and i do believe in it because i made one decision early in my career 
take a big studio movie because what you do when a young filmmaker if you get the opportunity you 
it and i ended up regretting that decision and since then always operated under the belief that i should 
every movie as though my last movie sc good yeah sd because one day it will be sc exactly 
sd and you never know when gonna happen sc well do you believe in the afterlife presumed that directors 
heaven or hell i know rc i wanna go to hell sc maybe there producers in hell maybe i 
yeah right yeah right what it is humphrey jennings is in hell writers and directors go to limbo writers 
to heaven rc correct laughter sc alright and the last one is you are out there on sd yeah 
pissing people off saying i mean you try to piss people off i think your goal but happy to 
things truthfully honestly right and on twitter also where people always debate not twitter in particular but should we 
just shut up should we protect ourselves should we lower the noise level and just not talk but i 
it very stimulating i try to put people in my twitter feed who are rewarding sd yeah sc i 
people who talk about twitter is just a source of terrible things like you get to choose who you 
sd yeah sc so what is your relationship with that sort of more social aspect of your job sd 
left twitter for a couple of months just to feel the noise kind of calm down and to reevaluate 
belief and then i came back and i came back because i do value it i do find it 
be rewarding both by controlling my twitter feed and who it is that actually going to listen to and 
the list of people who in a particular mood or i wanna see what this list has to say 
sc sometimes i just want to hear about the sd right right exactly but i think as a user 
been enlivening in that met a lot of great people as a result of it made a lot of 
connections but i love it as a form of expression not out there to try to influence anybody or 
mind about anything so not trying i wanna shout into the void about what angry about and tweeted plenty 
trump but usually just because an expression of is how i am feeling today about this sc and express 
back sd yeah and i also am scaling back on that trying to do less and less of that 
i love it as just an opportunity to express what i think and feel about things and for me 
cinema and a little bit with politics but cargill when i spoke about this last night and cargill has 
actively using his twitter feed to tweet specifically about writing about the craft of writing and he was saying 
i said to him last night i said what do you think i should be doing differently with my 
because i am getting a little bored with the whole world of it and he was encouraging me to 
more about the craft of directing sc yeah sd and i thought know really true because no doing that 
i can do that and i think that that will have value and i think enjoy it and i 
teaching and something where i can actually give valuable information that very few people have and nobody on twitter 
really doing that sc well it makes perfect sense maybe but it seems like a vibrant screenwriting twitter in 
way that not a vibrant directing in twitter sd absolutely true yeah absolutely true i think and i think 
i think it should be that way i think there should be a rc if i can chime in 
a second sc you can sd c robert cargill ladies and gentlemen rc you take a medium in which 
to write and then you put writers in it and what do you expect sc yeah married to a 
they cannot stop on twitter yes scientists are much more reluctant but alright that all makes a lot of 
this is extraordinarily fun and insightful so scott derrickson thanks so much for being on my podcast sd oh 
pleasure sean thank you music what a lively stimulating podcast episode the title do justice to the range of 
discussed including organization collaboration the need for limits in art and more also delightful to hear a conversation particularly 
days between two bright people who demonstrate how to disagree respectfully finally a breath of fresh air when people
