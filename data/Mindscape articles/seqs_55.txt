so essentially then what happened was that the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they
essentially then what happened was that the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried
then what happened was that the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure
what happened was that the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when
happened was that the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they
was that the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were
that the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm
the circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and
circuitry of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed
of the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and
the ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so
ancient structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so forth
structures the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so forth sc
the hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so forth sc and
hypothalamus and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so forth sc and this
and the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so forth sc and this is
the brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so forth sc and this is a
brain stem were changed integrated into cortex and you had mothers who now felt pain when their infants were away from them felt good felt pleasure when they were close by pain when they cried pleasure when they were warm and fed and so forth sc and this is a very
