hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll all heard that the earth is getting warmer 
in the middle of global climate change and that climate change is being caused by human beings and their 
on the globe whether farming or fossil fuel burning transportation etcetera so a depressing prospect because it is very 
and going to hurt us in very important ways but nevertheless still room for bits of optimism maybe we 
do something about it maybe there is reason for hope that the human race will actually figure itself out 
get this right before we completely destroy the planet sc guest is ramez naam who is a professional technologist 
also a science fiction writer the author of the nexus trilogy which is a wonderful set of books i 
you to read and about a future where we have brain implants that let us communicate with the internet 
something very very interested in myself but in his professional capacity thinking mostly these days about our energy future 
especially the future of renewable energy sc so in podcast we sort take the optimistic view on climate change 
energy generally we say is it conceivable that we will be able to free ourselves from a dependence on 
fuels and get to a point where we can still enjoy the high energy consumption that drives our society 
now without destroying the atmosphere or leading to global climate change so ramez is optimistic by nature and pretty 
he knows his stuff he lays out a case that at least possible to be optimistic we might do 
things to the planet but not absolutely necessary and of course at the end of the podcast i do 
a little bit of time to ask about brain implants and other crazy science fictiony things so a very 
conversation a little bit of reason for hope in the midst of this doom and gloom sc remember that 
is a website for mindscape preposterousuniversecompodcast and on the website you can find information about going to the patreon 
supporting on patreon if you want adfree versions of the show and if you want a monthly ask me 
episode and with that go music sc ramez naam welcome to the mindscape podcast ramez naam sean an honor 
so i asked you on because fascinated by what things said and done about clean energy and the future 
in looking over the very things written and spoken about this overwhelming sense of optimism comes through about technological 
and the future and so forth and met more optimistic people even than you but i would definitely say 
a percentile optimist about the rn about right sc of humankind so why we help the audience a little 
place you in some kind of context you have this fun trajectory where you came up as a computer 
then you wrote fiction and now proselytizing for clean energy rn ramez naam and i know what going to 
when i grow up yeah i spent thirteen years at microsoft did stuff with cloud services email search big 
machine learning i have written three science fiction novels about neuroscience sort of cyberpunk enovels that people seem to 
the nexus trilogy and now a clean energy wonk i wrote a book about how to save the planet 
and that led me to becoming the cochair for energy and environment at singularity university so i project the 
of clean energy how fast the prices are dropping and i do a lot of speaking about how that 
us some hope for climate change sc and since your message does seem to be mostly there is reason 
optimism i do want to say sure that this optimism is driven mostly by facts by research by rn 
i hope so sc by things you can back up but in my experience with humankind it has also 
a strong intrinsic personality component do other people want to look on the sunny side or the dark side 
things so would you say that you are in addition to being driven by the facts and realitybased that 
intrinsically optimistic person rn i am intrinsically optimistic and i think probably genetic i think that also optimistic just 
of the numbers about human history in the max roser steven pinker camp of look at the numbers all 
bad things hunger child mortality disease warfare going down and good things life expectancy education etcetera etcetera going up 
that also sort of gives me context for my optimism sc yeah i do think that basically on that 
in the sense that in many very quantifiable ways things are getting better if i want to channel the 
point of view here i would say yes but our capacity for doing great harm is also increasing so 
the trend line is upward but fluctuations around the trend line are broadening rather than shrinking so very possible 
everything gets better and better and better until we destroy ourselves right whether through climate or nuclear war or 
so how strong is your concern about those kinds of existential worries rn a concerned optimist and not just 
the existential worries inequality worries me and i believe that being an optimist mean you should be complacent and 
think we should be doing more faster and climate change for instance i think not on pace for two 
celsius for staying below that now it used to be that business as usual was six degrees bent that 
and now i think tracking for twoandahalf to three degrees but we should do more sc two degrees to 
who are completely not following the discourse on climate change maybe two degrees sound like a lot but it 
of is really a lot right rn it kind of is a lot yeah it would be warmer than 
planet has ever been since humanity existed as a species and if you think the middle of the last 
age was only about four degrees celsius colder than it is now so two degrees is a lot at 
same time not a threshold where the world ends not the case that degrees is just hunkydory and not 
case that at degrees you get armageddon so i think in addition to people underestimating how fast going to 
fossil fuels with clean energy i think people also underestimate our adaptability as a species and the many ways 
to us adapt to a warm planet sc usually i take as part of i invite people who i 
have interesting and important and true things to say and then i try to mildly disagree with them because 
is my job as the podcast host but maybe we should just let the optimism flow for this podcast 
will have other people on to talk about the doom and gloom scenarios for climate change one way or 
other or for ai or for whatever so that we can be optimistic a little bit with a footnote 
everyone should decide for themselves why should we be so optimistic what is it about energy production that makes 
happy right now rn well the case that going to switch over more rapidly is an economic case which 
that the cost of clean energy solar wind batteries electric cars has just been in freefall if you look 
solar panels themselves look at the price you pay for a watt of solar panel in it was seventyseven 
and today in the of cents twentyfive cents maybe say like a three hundred fifty times cost reduction insane 
just the last decade the cost of electricity from solar counting everything the land you need to buy the 
to deploy the panels the other hardware that you need and operating it keeping them clean has dropped by 
factor of and so now we have places where not only is solar and wind not only are solar 
wind cheaper to build new solar and wind than to build new coal or gas but cheaper to build 
solar and wind and storage in some places than it is to keep existing coal power plants and in 
cases existing natural gas power plants running sc old enough to remember when jimmy carter put solar panels on 
top of the white house and as soon as ronald reagan got into office he took them down like 
out of spite as far as i can tell certainly a component of people who resist i mean maybe 
now because the obviousness of climate change is much more clear now than it was in the and but 
are definitely people who want us to go in that direction how much of your optimism is based on 
reading of what human beings want to see happen rn actually really interesting surveys in america and america is 
only country even like this show that climate change is hugely divisive and that really changed i mean younger 
are way more bought into the science but still highly highly polarizing so not why making progress we are 
progress because clean energy is universally loved almost not quite universally but super majorities everywhere say that solar is 
first choice for energy source for their community wind is their next natural gas is like twenty points down 
that and coal is down at the bottom so that i think informs all of the politics obviously a 
more gets done in blue states than red states and a lot more gets done when democrats are in 
at a federal level than republicans but some actually got done in two thousand fifteen when republicans had both 
of congress and even in two thousand seventeen they could have torn down a lot of stuff federally and 
really left the clean energy incentives and policies in place federally sc do you personally have solar power rn 
do in seattle which is one of the sc oh my goodness rn sunny pieces parts of america but 
have i got a solar installation on my home last year sc what was that like what was the 
like has it been rewarding rn really easy i mean basically my bills are just going down i have 
separate bill for the solar the utility bill has gone down by more than the bill for the solar 
in seattle certainly in the summer months sc in la we definitely want to do it with the only 
holding us up is that in a townhouse with a association that plans to completely redo the roof in 
or three years so i presume that solar panels will get in the way of that so probably going 
wait for that but just bought my first electric car and i can imagine the new future finally rn 
it is coming coming fast i mean solar is just growing like gangbusters and fluctuate a bit but really 
for the most part will people will buy the cheapest energy possible and so now that solar and wind 
usually the cheapest they have an increasing ability to win in power market auctions that we have and now 
just introducing market mechanisms to lots of places so that they actually do have the chance to go head 
head against coal and gas sc so i think it is unimpeachable that the cost has fallen so why 
it fallen pretend that we actually think about the technology a little bit is not just that we think 
about it and everything becomes cheaper right i mean there must be specific technological improvements that have come into 
rn there is a magical not magical but a philosophical question really about why fallen because if you look 
the decline in the cost of solar or wind or batteries they all follow called the learning curve or 
have a learning rate or sometimes called a law wright was a world war ii economist who studied the 
of airplanes and found that every doubling of manufacturing of the same model airplane brought down the price by 
fixed percentage by sc rn yeah and solar every doubling of scale has brought down the price by on 
and so why is that mostly not that the panels are better though part of it it is mostly 
the manufacturing process gets better and people criticize the solar industry the solar industry only reinvests of revenue in 
but not the stuff on the rd budget bringing the price down actually factory efficiencies so they learn how 
have a higher labor productivity how to get more work done with the same number of people they install 
machines that cost more money but have a lot more output they automate things that humans used to do 
slice the silicon wafers that turn into solar panels more thinly less silver per watt of solar i could 
on and on the temperatures after reaching the ovens to turn silica into silicon wafers are lower than they 
to be gotten more efficient so really going on driving us and the same at the whole project level 
labor it takes to deploy solar across a big deployment of many acres has gone down gotten more efficient 
inverters they use to turn dc electricity into ac have gotten cheaper and more efficient across the board people 
finding economies that are leading to lower cost sc so that is kind of fascinating i actually know that 
presumed that it was advancements in the fundamental technology but saying just getting better at doing what it is 
been doing all along so there rn the technology is getting better too but more slowly than the cost 
dropping sc yeah and so how far can we extrapolate that i i do have part of me that 
whenever people mention exponentials as a scientist i know really exponential other than the expansion of the universe more 
a sigmoid kind of curve where look exponential for a while before leveling off and the always when will 
level off do we see an end point a steady state new normal for solar costs rn so i 
in the growth of solar and how much solar we deploy it is going to be sigmoid because entered 
phase where phase one was all of history to about two thousand fifteen solar had to be subsidized suddenly 
two thousand fifteen you had places in the world where new solar was in sunny places just cheaper than 
coal and new gas which is amazing and same with wind and windy places and then at the very 
maybe a year or two away really from the point where building new solar or new or new solar 
new wind is cheaper than running existing coal existing gas and then i think the growth rate accelerates but 
you do hit headwinds and you hit that top of the sigmoid as more and more of your electricity 
solar and wind that are intermittent it gets harder and harder just by deploying more of them we have 
deploy other stuff instead to shift the load around and so on rn but different than cost not clear 
me if cost really has an end point or not but every doubling brings down the cost by and 
doubling is physically more stuff so if you look out about four doublings only of world electricity so still 
still in its infancy sc plenty of room rn yeah four doublings it gets to at that point talking 
sunny parts of the world really sunny parts of the world having one cent per kilowatt hour of solar 
that compares to like five cents from natural gas five to ten cents from coal depending on where you 
in the world and just like a really really amazing price chuckle that gives you the freedom to do 
like overbuild your solar by a factor of two so that even in the winter months when not very 
you have enough electricity sc i love the fact already mentioned that at some point it becomes cheaper to 
new solar production than to just run your existing coal plant i think many people appreciate that rn yeah 
disruptive phase what i think of as the third phase of clean energy phase one had to be subsidized 
two competitive for new electricity phase three cheaper to build new solar wind or storage than to keep existing 
or gas running sc and what on the cusp of right now rn yeah so we saw last year 
ceo of nextera said that would happen in the early so a think tank called carbon tracker said it 
happen in the early and then in october of last year this utility in northern indiana called nipsco announced 
five year road map their irp their resource plan and they are currently coalpowered in a red state went 
donald trump by nineteen points and they said that it would save their customers four dollars billion for them 
shut down all that coal and replace it with solar wind batteries and flexible demand so saying here now 
least when they look at their five year window their window out to two thousand twentythree or so sc 
pretty good when we say solar we were just talking about solar panels on our roof but also giant 
farms is there a proper mixture or is one obviously dominant over the other rn most of it is 
in the world almost most of it is giant solar farms in the us about of our solar and 
probably does really have the highest value to the grid though as we get more distributed storage putting a 
in your town home as well as solar the value of solar on the edge of the grid at 
home goes up actually so hard to say exactly generally most models find that centralized solar is just higher 
you can deploy it more cheaply and get the economies of scale than putting it on lots of individual 
but the stuff on the roofs adds value too sc when we drive to vegas we go past these 
farms i forget the names of them but right on the border of california and nevada there are these 
fields of mirrors shining brightly on to a tower and not sure what actually happens inside those towers do 
boil water how do they turn that rn so an older form of solar called solar thermal or concentrating 
and yeah they concentrate the heat on a small area and heat up usually water which turns a turbine 
more recently people are building projects like that with molten salt instead of water as the working fluid and 
you get twelve hours of energy storage along with the solar because the salt just has so much thermal 
it just stays hot for so sc heat condensing yeah rn that you can keep turning a turbine over 
sc could we convert the existing farms to molten salt rn no so actually not that many concentrating solar 
in the world really overtaken it is solar pv solar photovoltaics materials mostly siliconbased that convert a photon into 
electron effectively sc and similar to what we would have on the roof right rn the same tech is 
your roof what is dominant in large utility scale solar deployments also sc and you and you should just 
it wherever sunniest rn you put it wherever sunniest and you pick sites that have the best sun which 
house may or may not and they use trackers which people on your house so they can track the 
keep the solar pv focused on the sun to maximize its energy production sc and of course the big 
is where you store the energy when you have fossil fuels you can burn them on demand when you 
them the sun is going to shine when it wants to shine and so batteries or something like that 
crucial i presume that had similar technological and cost advantagesimprovements with the battery situation rn yeah between two thousand 
and now batteries lithiumion batteries the kind in your cell phone your electric car and that we use in 
grid have dropped in cost by a factor of nine so really surprising actually really shocking to a lot 
people when you say that energy storage is still actually really expensive but other battery chemistries going to drop 
price another factor of three to five and actually probably be enough to get it to where we have 
good cheap grid storage but other battery chemistries like flow batteries that are more suitable for the grid and 
think this is the year or maybe next year where really start to see commercialization of those and a 
function down in cost over their lifetime sc could you explain what a flow battery is rn yeah so 
lithiumion battery moves a lithium ion through an electrolyte from a positive electrode to a negative electrode and back 
a flow battery moves electrolyte through a membrane and so in that either one direction of flow is producing 
the other direction of flow is sucking in electricity and the thing really nice about that is you can 
a true flow battery you can separate the size of the tank that contains electrolyte from the membrane in 
power stack that controls how much power you can output if you want to add more hours these tanks 
just injection molded plastic and the electrolytes at least in some battery chemistries are super cheap like with the 
that involved with really just iron and salt basically and so you just build a bigger plastic tank and 
in more of this iron and salt solution so you can increase the hours that you store really really 
sc and is the future once i know just asking you to extrapolate into the future but is it 
the power companies have gihumongous batteries or that we all have batteries in our garage rn right now in 
us the battery segment growing the most rapidly is behind the meter but in commercial buildings not in homes 
okay rn so i think this will be different than solar is have maybe half and half have a 
of solar or a lot of batteries at the solar plant at the wind farm in a centralized location 
the grid also have a lot at the edge and the reason is that at the edge in your 
in the office building in the mall it has other benefits and those benefits are things like if a 
outage it keeps the power up and maybe it does for the neighborhood also have it at the substation 
and keep the whole neighborhood up it has other benefits like the electricity lines that run to your home 
your neighborhood probably pretty close to full at pm to pm but empty at midnight so we can fill 
the battery in your region at midnight with wind power ideally or maybe hydro and then drain it down 
the peak of the day so you get additional flexibility by a lot like in software we have caching 
the edge of the network a lot like that actually sc yeah okay good and does this improvement in 
technology extend to cars as well i know a big issue with electric cars right now is the range 
well i think more a psychological issue than anything else you look at a tesla model a three hundred 
mile range version right so i think getting to the point that range anxiety is more about psychology than 
the vehicles themselves that said what going to see in electric cars is the batteries get cheaper and cheaper 
cheaper and that means that in a couple of years maybe two years from now maybe three a new 
car will be the same price or cheaper a new electric car with a two hundred mile range or 
will be the same price or cheaper than an internal combustion car very similar and cost a quarter as 
to keep running the maintenance cost is a quarter the energy cost per mile is a quarter so just 
to make it more and more of a nonbrainer a nobrainer for people to deploy now increasing range is 
historically price has come down really fast and capacity energy density how much energy you have per unit of 
so the capacity is what you would call it it has gone up more slowly so since the price 
come down by a factor of nine the energy density by weight has gone up by maybe sc and 
with what you said earlier about the price improvements coming from economies of scale kinda building a version of 
same thing but building it better but the thing building is still limited rn right it is learning by 
which is a little different than economies of scale but yeah the manufacturing process gets better a lot faster 
musk says this thing of one engineer working to improve the battery factory is worth ten engineers working on 
the battery chuckle sc alright but at least i think making a pretty persuasive case for an optimistic electric 
in the sense that we can make it using solar we can store it in batteries locally and elsewhere 
about the wind component here it always seemed weird to me that wind and solar which are two utterly 
technologies should be in any way comparable why are they relatively the same kind of cost rn well the 
is going to be just cheaper than wind but the nice thing about wind is countercyclical to solar roughly 
sun only shines during the day and if you see sun at night check with your doctor chuckle rn 
statistically is faster at night than it is during the daytimes the solar peak almost every continent on earth 
summer and the wind trough when wind is low and conversely wind maximum really spring but quite high in 
as well and when solar is at its bottom so across a continent size which is the right size 
grids you get a real complementarity and you can actually get maybe or even of your electricity from solar 
wind and some smart software controls of consumption without any storage if you build really a continentsized grid and 
the solar and wind at ideal complementary locations sc do you see any future for more wild speculative ideas 
solar collectors in space that would beam the power down or is that just something not even really necessary 
not necessary it does have advantages island nations and places like taiwan or south korea that would benefit from 
like that but the launch costs have to drop a couple of more orders of magnitude for that to 
pencil out sc yeah i think it would be a nearterm thing but i just wondered talking only about 
there are other things we need power for also right once we have solar and wind taking over most 
our electricity are we still burning fossil fuels at a tremendous rate rn so david roberts is an amazing 
on the climate change beat at fox he says the plan is this electrify everything and make the electricity 
so basically what trying to do as a first order approximation and what you have is electricity itself is 
quarter of emissions another quarter roughly a little less than a quarter is transport the cars and trucks we 
how to do ships and planes are hard both small each of global emissions right now so got some 
figure it out then you have industry which well you have building heat is like and we have heat 
starting to become viable still more expensive than just burning gas but a future for them and they are 
cheaper and more efficient and then you have industry making the steel making the cement that goes into buildings 
so there are people that are trying a whole lot of things a whole lot of science and a 
of startups and investments by people like bill gates in startups that have ways to make steel and cement 
plastics without producing carbon emissions and sc and then maybe i suppose just going into why does producing steel 
in carbon emissions rn so that industry so steel making really two separate things in industry one is in 
of these processes you need a heat source and just burning natural gas or burning coal is a cheap 
to get heat and renewables like clean electricity has to get down to a cent and a half a 
hour to compete with that now there are advantages you look at electric arc furnaces which is how we 
scrap steel and turn it into steel for reuse and they electrified a long time ago it let them 
the mills much smaller get rid of a lot of equipment that they no longer needed to use so 
are advantages of electrifying anyway one half the other half is what we call process emissions so in steel 
ore contains a whole lot of oxygen and you have oxygen in your steel so you have to have 
reducing agent that takes the oxygen out and right now you burn coal and it supplies both the heat 
the carbon atoms that combine with the oxygen and they turn into laughter sc good for your steel bad 
the atmosphere yes rn yeah so people are playing with using hydrogen as the reducing agent thyssenkrupp one of 
biggest steel makers has a project doing that at big scale and then the hydrogen reacts with the oxygen 
turns into water which is not so harmful to emit still a lot more expensive but people are going 
try to get the costs down sc well but also when we think about saving the planet there are 
who focus on individual virtue right conservation and just using up less fossil fuels there are others who focus 
policy for the solar and electricity part you paint a picture which renders both of those irrelevant it will 
just because of economics just cheaper right just as cheaper to use solar but for the steel it sounds 
even if we can make it more cleanly it will always cost more money rn so what we need 
do in steel and cement and planes and ships is do what started us off in solar and wind 
was policy actually so imagine that these learning curves exist every doubling of scale brings down the cost why 
anyone deploy solar when it had to be subsidized well because they put subsidies in place because they thought 
they did that the industry would get on its own two feet and bring down the cost and it 
better than anyone expected so germany one of the least sunny countries on earth actually less sunny than most 
canada for americans chuckle germany really started this solar revolution by deploying huge amounts of solar and wind in 
when it cost more than ten times as much in a country with the sunlight resources of canada but 
started the industry scaling and it went on through many doublings before we even got to half a percent 
electricity being from solar it went through many many doublings and each of those brought the price down rn 
what we need to do is do that with the sectors that we yet have price competition for is 
have to say going to have a mandate x percent of the cement maybe in california x percent of 
cement used in new buildings has to be carbon neutral x percent of the steel that comes into california 
the form of cars or beams for buildings has to be carbon and that will create a market that 
allow the startups that have technology that can do that to raise funding and do more rd get them 
up by big industrial companies or scale themselves that can scale them and that scaling will start to bring 
the cost as well and then hopefully at one point at some point that cost is below the cost 
the old way we did it sc and are these policies being pursued rn no got a todo list 
to look at it laughter to make a proposal for what california should do actually laughter been busy lately 
gavin newsom if listening to this podcast i just told you what you should do and facebook and google 
building big buildings right now you should build them with carbonneutral cement there are actually efforts in europe not 
driven by policy quite yet but there is big investor groups that are pushing these companies like thyssenkrupp to 
time to deal with steel you guys need to start working on the problem is that thyssenkrupp have customers 
their customers are like take the cheaper chuckle so gotta be some policy to bootstrap the market for this 
in the early days and drive it down in cost sc yeah i think awareness that coal and oil 
is bad for the atmosphere is pretty high but maybe awareness that steel and cement are also big drivers 
lower it seems like a lowhanging fruit for policy makers to really make an improvement rn yeah and i 
also just the case that what looks like very incremental policy can do a lot california i know what 
first renewable portfolio standard was in california i think it was or by a certain year and now but 
up to that sound crazy if we said of cement and steel coming into california or washington or new 
has to be clean that sound unachievable but that would be a gigantically larger market for carbonfree steel or 
steel and carbonneutral cement than exists today and it would help those industries scale a lot sc and then 
have the cows belching and creating methane right a whole other kettle of fish rn so the last quarter 
what the ipc calls agriculture forestry and land use and also a quarter of emissions probably hard to get 
accurate numbers on deforestation and it really comes down to livestock mammal livestock and deforestation primarily and some other 
like nitrogen fertilizer decomposing on fields manure from those cows decomposing on fields cow burps not farts cow burps 
methane sc yep cow burps rn are about of global emissions so as big as planes and ships put 
but sc yeah sounds small but big if the fraction of all global emissions rn yeah bigger than all 
and all shipping chuckle but really cattle emit the most methane and what we have the most of pigs 
a part of it but overwhelmingly cattle and cattle are historically the number one drivers of deforestation though i 
palm oil also has a big role to play right now in malaysia and indonesia deforestation used to the 
hot spot was the amazon and there it came down a lot though rising now under bolsonaro in brazil 
nowhere near where it was but we want to get it down to zero or negative we want to 
planting trees in the amazon growing the amazon not shrinking it even a bit but now deforestation has shifted 
indonesia and malaysia where a lot of it is planting palm plantations to produce palm oil that goes to 
nigeria sudan darfur was partially caused by deforestation say countries like that in africa and there cattle is actually 
fair bit of it agriculture overall is a fair bit of that deforestation and probably cattle mostly sc and 
deforestation sounds bad because forests are good but is it also just taking away these sinks of in all 
plants is that a major part of the problem rn takes away a sink and more than that the 
already in that forest in the trees and plants gets emitted into the air alright and so you produce 
immediate emission quite large there was there have been times in the past few years days anyway where the 
in indonesia or malaysia there people using a saw to chop down a tree is a lot harder than 
fire so in indonesia and malaysia also in particular people are poor like poor farmers that have small lots 
light fires to try to clear land and the fire got out of control and there were times in 
past years where those fires were putting more carbon into the atmosphere on a given day than all of 
economy of japan and then you have less of the sink as well sc so what are we going 
do about this exactly laughter rn this is a really hard one this is what keeps me up the 
at night cows scare me more than cars sc and just to put it in perspective sure you know 
maybe most people the number of cows alive on earth today is preposterous compared to what it ever used 
be right human rn two billion sc yeah human beings rn yeah no actually last i looked it was 
over one billion head of cattle which is still a lot sc we like our cows there was never 
many cows rn they out mass us our cows out mass us sc yeah chuckle more pounds of cow 
earth rn aggravate them laughter the cow revolution will not be pretty sc so we can fantasize about impossible 
taking over and synthetic meat but is that really the best mediumterm solution rn i think things like the 
burger and things like stem cell meat have a chance not that bullish on them but i think when 
look at processed meat where you have the original texture i think they have a chance to go into 
but i sc so get impossible pepperoni before we get impossible tbone steaks rn right yeah or stem cell 
before we get stem cell tbone steaks and so i think there is a real chance there and really 
beef that matters right so although a case a company finless foods doing impossible tuna basically or stem cell 
and there the case is conservation of tuna that overfishing sc yeah okay rn but from a climate perspective 
enough so we have to figure out a we have to protect forests just done america has a lot 
cattle in it too but guess what in america and europe forests are growing not shrinking why because protected 
and because the land privately owned for logging the loggers all have commitments to replant faster than they chop 
not the healthiest forest not the most biodiverse forest but still a forest and as it gets older if 
fifty years like there is some serious biodiversity in those so sc i did a podcast interview with joe 
a conservationist and he makes the case that we are at an inflection point in the sigmoid curve of 
population and mostly because of urbanization and we can imagine a new normal where most people live in cities 
still plenty of room even if twelve to twenty billion people on earth for a lot of nature out 
to flourish rn definitely right agriculture is the dominant form of our land use right it a third of 
land area of the planet is agriculture a third is unusable mountains deserts so on and a third is 
more or less i mean cities are human habitations are like or not very big so densification shifting people 
of agriculture economy into an urban economy around industrial stuff or services and taking away giving them alternate ways 
produce revenue instead of chopping down forest and then intensification of agriculture the yields of agriculture how much food 
grow per acre in the us are twice the global average and four times what they are in a 
like bangladesh so as farmers in bangladesh get tractors fertilizer pesticides or gmos which also prohibited from getting more 
less their productivity goes up and that means that you can then pass laws to spare the forest protect 
while still pulling these people up out of poverty and producing enough food to feed yourself so gotta do 
and probably gotta improve the cows somehow so they burp as much laughter or what we feed them one 
the other sc i bet synthetic biology can do that right rn so right now the rage is additives 
potential additives very famously a red seaweed that in very small experiments when cows ate it massively cut their 
production sc really rn and when a emitting methane when burping it energy leaving it so the people that 
these additives which are very limited so far one startup i know that has one different what they claim 
that if you feed a cow this stuff not only does it produce less methane but that energy methane 
a very highenergy molecule that energy gets turned into more productivity either the cow puts on more mass or 
more milk so what hoping is true not convinced yet there has not been enough skeptical science done on 
but if true it gives us a path to maybe help farmers in a way that also helps the 
and if that work then i think talking about synthetic biology really the microbiome that does the work that 
the methane so maybe we can just engineer the microbiome and not call it a gmo cow laughter rn 
knows sc always a race right between technology making messes and technology trying to clean them up and i 
a rule of thumb for who wins in these rn no sc i think that it there are reasons 
be optimistic but i look at them not as reasons that everything will be okay but that there are 
we can do to make things better rn yeah right right i think like i said not currently on 
to two degrees celsius and there are tail risks there are positive feedback loops that most models say are 
to kick in at three degrees c but they could right sc are we talking about things like melting 
permafrost and so forth rn yeah i mean the permafrost melt gets a lot of press today relatively speaking 
a tiny contribution to atmospheric methane but you know there is reason to expect some nonlinearity there and most 
again show that still going to that even at the much faster than expected pace that happening still a 
small contributor to atmospheric methane but you like to see nonlinear things headed in the direction that you like 
sc especially if unpredictable a little bit i mean rn yeah sc a reason to be cautious but your 
of the bangladeshi farmers is a reminder of how interconnected all of these different concerns are not just the 
but the conditions of people around the world and it reminds me before i forget i want to just 
the weird fact that some not huge but still too large fraction of our global energy consumption is chinese 
farms right laughter rn yeah sc but if right that solar power will eventually be cheaper than coal then 
if crazily mining bitcoins they be destroying the environment does that make sense rn in fact be driving down 
cost of solar by scaling it and putting it through the learning curve so i actually think that crypto 
think that an increase in electricity demand if you can put your electricity demand application anywhere on earth is 
good for the planet it allows us to scale solar and wind faster least cost and that drives them 
in cost faster now the reason people mine bitcoin in china is because trying to escape chinese money controls 
not necessarily the case that going they put their project in chile where you have the best sun in 
world sc yeah laughter rn or even in china in the far west hitting unsubsidized prices the first unsubsidized 
plants in china were really built this year and the whole industry is expected to be unsubsidized in two 
sc right but all these interconnections so i go back to the bangladeshi farmer or kids in somalia or 
like that are being rapidly technologized i know if the word but maybe you can talk a little bit 
this i think this is an underappreciated thing there are places in the world that are still desperately high 
of poverty but things are changing there pretty rapidly this is part of your optimism portfolio right rn yeah 
believe in the singularity but i do believe in the synchularity when everyone is connected and i think the 
is here right now more or less or happening as we speak and amazing and the reason happening is 
simple a cell phone is cheaper than a toilet and a cell phone and a cell tower is cheaper 
a toilet and plumbing and a waste processing system so you have this leapfrogging happening where people particularly in 
and subsaharan africa are getting smartphones getting access to the internet getting cameras and apps and music and a 
and whatever it is they do they might not even be very literate getting that even though they have 
improved water source or plumbing system that we would recognize as modern and fascinating and then the hope is 
the hope is that in the us we say the phone is the third screen right screen one is 
tv screen two is a laptop screen three is the phone rn the first phone for most of the 
the first screen for most of the planet so that becomes the platform for education that becomes the platform 
transparency and taking a picture of a corrupt official in your area that becomes the platform for knowing market 
instead of having to walk to market and see the price for your crop today you can check on 
internet and see should you sell or not the platform for financial inclusion all of it sc weather forecasting 
rn weather forecasting sc actions yeah rn i was just talking to somebody a software guy wants to do 
to improve climate and agriculture i said an app that tells farmers in africa when to plant their that 
that hard sure really hard laughter but nevertheless like if a software guy what you can do so that 
a lot and in the five year window now across africa i think smartphone penetration is cell phone penetration 
in the high to among adults smartphone penetration is somewhere in to except south africa where like say and 
to race in the next three four or five years going to get to smartphones being ubiquitous in subsaharan 
and then what happens i know then everybody has mobile money that solves a lot of the problems for 
can you pay for solar on your roof everybody has an educational platform and then does that produce more 
gains as well as people start to be able to earn a living in different ways i hope so 
i think that might ultimately be one of the greatest povertyreducing things on planet earth sc well i was 
to ask if you have smartphones but not toilets do we have any data on how much that can 
help you get ahead but maybe the answer is no because just happening too quickly and we seen it 
rn hard to get the data i mean we have case studies of how it affects you know incomes 
up when they have smartphones because they have access to the market we do know so having mobile money 
some sort allows is the key to getting solar on the roof of your home in africa because too 
to send somebody around every place to collect cash but if you have mobile money the solar panels are 
software controlled if you pay as you go if you paid they shut down so motivated to pay and 
mobile money in some places the telcos or banks are holding it back but once everybody has a smartphone 
hold it back clicking an app so that facilitates people getting solar on their roofs much more easily and 
creates lighting and lighting there are conflicting studies but at least a good chunk that show that it leads 
better educational outcomes the kids can study at home rn and it leads to more family income because they 
have a little small business at home where the wife is doing some clothes mending the dad is doing 
woodworking something that it allows them to be industrious at hours they be industrious and it saves them money 
almost all of these countries if you have mobile money solar on your roof is actually cheaper than kerosene 
cleaner and safer so that starts to look like a domino effect that leads to some income growth and 
growth sc yeah it definitely sounds very exciting and africa of course has struggled for generations now but it 
from the picture painting that the next few years are going to be a whirlwind of transformation there is 
something where the governments in africa are encouraging it or at least not trying to stop it rn it 
from country to country kenya did some very smart things and you see kenya are really thriving nigeria is 
most populous country in africa and the fifth most populous country in the world maybe fourth even fifth i 
but economy is really based on a resource extraction and so probably less long term sustainable so you just 
different things happening but places like rwanda ethiopia east africa uganda east africa in general i think you see 
lot of economic growth based on agricultural productivity based on light industrial work that sort of thing sc and 
it something that suggests strategies for wellmeaning western governments or individuals charities to help things along rn yeah you 
want to just give people stuff you want to bootstrap industries and the aid literature is beyond me deep 
in the aid literature the foreign aid literature of what works but we know that just handing out money 
just handing out handing out money is better handing out food in an emergency for instance is terrible it 
the local prices of food the farmers make any money it drives the farmers out of business right so 
want to replace there you want to provide seed capital and advice for people to be able to build 
on the ground that can keep operating and you want sc i can imagine that in the aftermath of 
hurricane or an earthquake bringing food is good but not the long term thing just because a region is 
poverty you want to build some infrastructure there rn give them better seeds instead of giving them food sc 
rn teach the farmers better agricultural techniques build them a fertilizer factory maybe within their means to maintain yeah 
also corruption is a big inhibitor of growth and the lack of markets is a big inhibitor of growth 
want a government that says going to have a relatively free most of the things are totally free have 
we have access to capital we nationalize companies all the time because that makes investors very scared to put 
in we pay our debts we overspend too you can debt spend some not corrupt we laughter sc a 
one rn pay our civil servants enough money that they can live on it and we hold them to 
that they get in the way of people doing sc the optimist would say that if everyone can talk 
each other on their smartphones that might help ferret out corruption and other various ways in which governments perform 
efficiently as they could i know if an empirically testable thing either rn i think say that in the 
it has not been as big an effect as we would like but cell phone videos of police brutality 
exposed a form of corruption in the us and have probably started some small but some steps towards reforming 
system and so i do think if somebody has the power to take a picture of a corrupt official 
a bribe or to walk in and surreptitiously record if somebody says you have this permit unless you pay 
a i think only good how much good it is i know sc and if cell phones are this 
in lesser developed regions of the world the analogous technology that will be disruptive and transformative in the developed 
i know that thought about human augmentation and brain computer interfaces quite a bit rn i think also cell 
actually laughter sc still cell phones okay smart phones yeah rn well my novels imagine tech in your brain 
can transmit it wirelessly and people are really working on that elon musk with neuralink bryan johnson with kernel 
jepsen with openwater people are really working on next generation of braincomputer interfaces but it will be slow i 
the layer between or the step between smartphones and directly in your brain is probably some combination of augmented 
and speech and natural language so at some point not really that soon but at some point maybe it 
twenty years away walking around with a pair of glasses that show you relevant data spam you and being 
to speak and have your basically having alexa with you at all times but way better rn and being 
to say that over or this or oh shoot i pick my seat for my flight tomorrow can you 
sure i get an or me what time is my i think the human augmentation is when wherever you 
then you can talk to and can talk back to you a la her but also show you some 
stuff and who knows maybe just your cell phone and speech and it involve augmented reality but pretty cool 
the thing can also see around you and show you visual information sc yeah i mean my computer does 
pretty good job of reminding me of upcoming things podcast recordings and so forth but also my computer in 
like some is a little bit too open to the world too easy for the rest of the world 
butt in sometimes i think that we yet figured all of that out and if it were directly into 
brain obviously that would be even more avenues for abuse would open up rn and i get to have 
fun with that in the novel sc yeah exactly rn anything that you can hack you anything connected can 
hacked fundamentally sc well so google glass got a lot of abuse but it always i always thought the 
was a little bit misplaced i mean the apple newton got a lot of abuse when it came out 
and that was a proto blackberry smartphone kind of thing which has now changed the world we need some 
first steps to get where we want to go and the idea of a wearable somehow that helps you 
with the world in a smarter way i get why people are afraid of it or skeptical but the 
seems pretty big to me i think going to happen rn yeah i think really quite interesting actually and 
seems to me going to happen as well sc have you did you try ever google glass or anything 
that rn i think i put one on at a conference or something it what i want is when 
can actually wearing glasses right now when the text or the animations whatever can actually appear on my glasses 
me to see or be projected onto my retina i want to have to look up in the corner 
want it to like highlight the thing i want to look at a thing and it do eye tracking 
know what i was just trying to focus on and say that over that sort of thing i want 
look at face and know that it knows where looking and have it present the information right over their 
of their name last time you talked to their kid laughter rn just really bad at that sc very 
at names terrible at names i had a dream last night of sitting next to someone who i know 
well and i know their name but obviously privacy and things like that worries right how worried are you 
such things if wearing glasses that can literally face recognize anyone whether met them before or not not an 
good rn not an unalloyed good and not all the way to david brin who says privacy is dead 
to have a surveillance society no matter just who controls it the people or powerful shadowy figures not all 
way there i think privacy is dead i think negotiate a new social contract and i think be messy 
think have places where devices like that operate or record at any rate rn and wearing a device that 
hacked to be able to ignore those signals will be considered very socially faux pas at a minimum and 
worse than that it will still be possible but a lot of things that are possible that happen often 
to social convention possible for me to take my car which is a missile and drive it into opposing 
or into a crowd and so shocked when that happens because it happen very often and so there is 
very strong social convention around that in a sense that going to suffer if you do that sort of 
so i think eventually get there on these privacy issues too but how what the path is from here 
there i know sc well the obvious worry about that analogy is that people make a lot of money 
of you driving into opposing traffic whereas people could make a lot of money out of all sorts of 
violations and i tend to be on side here i actually read his opinions about this but looking at 
people and how willing they are to share things online i wonder if the idea of privacy just become 
kind of something you rn i think young people have gotten out of the idea of privacy young people 
much understand privacy and maybe more into it than adults ask a young person about anything about their relationship 
sex and find out how they feel about privacy they want to choose who they communicate things to sc 
rn right and they might be willing to share more with the world on some topics or with their 
on some topics but they very much understand that things that they want to communicate or they learn over 
sc as a no longer young person probably being unfair to the young people i do see people oversharing 
the internet but probably just a unrepresentative slice of people right rn the kids these days sc yeah the 
these days on my lawn i wish they would get off it but is there okay what about the 
side of things i can kind of see in my everyday life where facial recognition would be useful is 
something always hard to predict what the killer apps are going to be when we get better at communicating 
with our computers is there something that becomes much easier right away rn i mean i think in a 
it amplifies our collective intelligence and let me make a case for that in history we have inventions made 
individual famous people probably an exaggeration not really how it happened but now less and less how it really 
you know this very well in your field giant teams of people working with giant instruments that were designed 
giant teams of people that do the work and so collective intelligence we have to collaborate to do that 
if we have more intuitive ways to share ideas knowledge questions designs whatever with each other i think that 
the friction and increases the bandwidth between us and probably allows groups like that to work more effectively i 
look at slack this is a bit of a tangent but why do people love slack a it reduces 
email slack sometimes drives you crazy with sc tell people some people out there actually even know what slack 
so maybe you should tell them rn slack is like internetrelay chat of the reimagined on the web as 
team collaboration tool but a team collaboration tool where you have your company or your startup or your group 
a channel and inside of it multiple rooms multiple channels inside of your space or whatever and so the 
interested in marketing can go in the marketing team area and anybody who joins the marketing team can go 
and unlike email all of the history of the marketing team conversations is right there and their documents and 
and i might be a dev or i might be on sales but i might pop over to marketing 
to see what talking about they can lock me out if they want to but they probably so a 
way to collaborate that has not perfect but has a lot of advantages over email and the idea is 
reduces friction and makes people more productive together right sc yeah over and above the ability to calculate the 
instantly you have a direct connection to some slow calculator i personally wonder and maybe this is optimistic not 
i think that once you people are underestimating the video capture element here if i have glasses that are 
at the world or something built into my brain that is accessing my visual cortex and just say it 
an image once every five seconds of what i see i think that totally changes the world not just 
sort of surveillance state ways but just in memory ways like what did i see at that thing that 
five years ago i can instantly pull it up i think that changes human cognition in an interesting way 
yeah run with that something else that happens i think these videos tap into human empathy if you read 
stat about police brutality one thing if you watch some of the videos really there and a second thing 
would increase empathy is automatic realtime speech translation so if you watch some iran we have tensions with today 
you watch the statements from iran or a news briefing like those weird people looking weird talking funny just 
be honest sc vaguely threatening yeah right rn vaguely threatening if you hear it in realtime translate it into 
with the voice those news conferences might still seem threatening but you can find other iranian content what if 
watched iranian movies because they subtitled they even dubbed they were just translated in the voice to you what 
you could have an iranian pen pal that you like just talk to and it just works instantly i 
that might increase our sense of empathy sc yeah very much in favor of that i did have a 
with paul bloom the psychologist antiempathy he thinks that empathy gets in the way of our rationality i think 
opposite i think that we trick ourselves into being rational by thinking of things a certain way and not 
that there are other ways to think or other facts that matter or other experiences of the world that 
completely shaped our everyday lives and so going to optimistically agree with you that our ability to experience things 
other people in a more visceral way might help the world come together a little bit sure be people 
are going to disagree about that but being optimistic today rn and rational is not the default state of 
human tribal is and empathy dissolves tribalism or at least expands your sense of who the in group is 
what we have to do with global problems i think speaking as a techno hippie here sc yeah techno 
and i do want to wrap up you did write this science fiction novel trilogy so first tell the 
who has not read the nexus trilogy which read the first book sorry i get to the next two 
tell us what about ideaheavy work but also a rollicking yarn as they say rn thanks so nexus is 
fastpaced techno thriller set in so not that far in the future twentyone years where invented a brain tech 
can swallow it you swallow a vial of a metallic fluid still sold as a party drug it gets 
your brain little nano machines that cross the bloodbrain barrier attach to your neurons and transmit what your brain 
doing via wifi and so if you and i both have it both taken it and in close proximity 
creates cory doctorow called it a weak telepathy we can see out of each eyes feel what the other 
is feeling and so on and a story about freedom versus control rn my protagonist is a young scientist 
he and his buddies and friends think this stuff is awesome and they want to make it a platform 
make it permanent in the and build apps on top of it and give it to the world so 
of cyberpunk but unlike william view where only the elite had it the question is we could give this 
everybody who gets to make that choice and then a cold war with china and cloned soldiers and maybe 
uploaded ai and lots of explosions and a lot of it takes place in thailand at a neuroscience conference 
buddhist monks talking about the connection within buddhism science and technology and they also like nexus sc yeah slightly 
but i read it very close to when i read the windup girl and like apparently all the great 
fiction is set in southeast asia these days just where things are going to happen rn paolo bacigalupi i 
the guy a friend of mine we talk at least on slack actually pretty often i love the windup 
also another amazing novel set in thailand sc and yeah by authors with egyptian and italian last names so 
was wondering whether a connection there or not but it is things going on but why did you write 
novels very tempted to write fiction myself but i never quite screwed up the couragetime to do it but 
made a conscious decision is it because this is the best way to work out these ideas is it 
the best way to reach an audience or is it just it sounded like fun rn i read science 
as the dominant thing that i read growing up and i i think science fiction is the literature of 
the literature that really has ideas about the big picture and then frankly i was writing i wanted to 
my book on how to save the planet called the infinite resource and my agent like it laughter and 
i was just like frustrated scott if listening to this the reason i have a science fiction career thank 
and so i like i said well i had written a nonfiction book before about human augmentation written a 
about braincomputer interfaces going to take that and make it a novel and i just did it and along 
way then we found a formulation of the book on energy and climate and resources that my agent did 
and we sold that book too and so then i had two books to write that was a busy 
sc did you find it challenging to write fiction do you people relationships the whole bit is very different 
rn i think i got a lot better by doing it i got a lot of advice most novelists 
keep it close to the heart and share a lot of what writing they just give it to their 
maybe four people i had fiftyfive people read different drafts of nexus friends of mine and give me copious 
they were just friends and i said you read and i took some advice from david brin actually first 
asked him did you put the book down where were you bored enough to put the book down please 
me that page number tighten but i would ask them a whole bunch of other questions and then invite 
over for a discussion of what they liked and like and i would say my first draft was a 
mess and not very good and probably offensive in some ways and by the fourth or fifth draft is 
you read it had gotten a lot better thanks not just to me but collective intelligence of my editors 
there you go oldfashioned collective intelligence yeah and aside from the personal reward of doing it do you think 
effective are you happy with how people responded rn yeah people love the book i mean the people who 
it it found a certain audience among people that are in tech and science and neuroscientists like it which 
the best compliment to me so awesome been a a nobody ever emails me and says your nonfiction of 
blog post about solar economics kept me up but occasionally somebody will be like i was up am reading 
and a treat and so i do think fiction narrative is a super power actually because human brains did 
evolve to be irrational or data weighing or what not paul bloom is wrong we evolved sc well sorry 
be fair to paul not saying that we are rational saying that we should work to maximize our rationality 
empathy gets in the way rn i retract him being wrong but not rational and not even empathy just 
and so if you can tell a narrative be very responsible with it because it slides past rationality and 
a deeper level of the reader or listener and they can start to believe things and so i do 
that fiction is a very powerful tool to change opinions sc alex rosenberg who was another previous guest a 
who rails against how stories can be used to make people believe things rather than deliberative argument and he 
failing in getting this message across so he began to write novels to illustrate his point and been wildly 
so there you go rn there you go sc do you have future plans for more fiction rn as 
as we have finished the energy no not going to be that long going to be a while yes 
i know when i definitely have more novels in me to write but the clean energy thing is sort 
allencompassing right now sc a pretty big thing yeah but when you write a novel or when you anticipate 
a novel do is it the idea that is there first and you want to illustrate it or do 
get a plot in your head or characters and want to put them in an interesting situation rn i 
vignettes and themes there are things i look around and interested in interested in tech unemployment interested in ai 
in the belief which i think is totally mistaken that ais will be killer ais that want to take 
the world interested in uploading interested in all the stuff happening with fake news interested in the future of 
interested in ar and vr and so things that sort of bubble up in my head and then i 
about what could the world look like an interesting world and the conflict going on the mystery or the 
that pulls you through sc yeah lots of novels to be written well good so i think done a 
good job of being optimistic mostly or at least giving people a feel for optimism is there any parting 
you want to leave that maybe action items like what can we do to even improve the chances that 
optimistic timeline comes to pass rn a good question well i would just say this when you read the 
go look for a stat go look for a number when you hear about any bad thing that happened 
look for the context of the larger number in it because the news exists to get your clicks and 
business model they know that outrage works and so i love great news media but the real news is 
and numbers and so keep hope because the story that gets the most revenue for news media is the 
negative story and so shit go find the ways the world is getting better and tell people about it 
them out of their malaise and motivate them not make them complacent sc yeah my version of that is 
i think that new stories should be much more filled with rates and frequencies and fractions of things rather 
just things happening even in vox which i really do like in many ways there was a story about 
restaurants and how there was a salmonella outbreak so like well what is the rate of that compared to 
outbreaks i think a little cognitive improvement that we could adopt very widely rn totally sc alright ramez naam 
so much for being on the podcast this was a very uplifting fun message rn sean thank you so 
been a blast music dishonest to discuss all the positives of renewable energy without touching on the toxicity and 
of lithium ion batteries you should have covered this in your podcast otherwise i enjoyed it very much it 
an interesting interview sean caroll introduces the podcast with there is reason for hope that the human race will 
figure itself out and get this right before we completely destroy the completely destroy the planet where does this 
from almost no climate scientist thinks this is even remotely possible ramez naam said not the case that degrees 
just of course it would be perfectly fine if the temperature rose to degrees by the eighty years of 
in every area will make that even better than most imagine a podcast on future energy cover everything but 
was surprised that there was no mention of nuclear power including the real possibility of nuclear fusion sometime after 
remaining optimistic in a climate emergency adam olsen mla dishonest mike lithiumion batteries a pollutant how batteries are rather 
us to move forward off of actually polluting means of energy so sure mining and transporting the raw materials 
currently emit some pollutants because they rely on old polluting tech however all of those stages are subject to 
rather soon leaving even the supply of raw materials for cells and batteries free of emissions in the near 
this is already the case for the production and assembly steps inside some renowned factories using green electricity this 
possible with fossil fuels it even possible with biofuels since they still emit a large range of air pollutants 
burned by engines and can never be truly net zero carbon which will become a requirement at some point 
the future also biofuels seems to be somewhat of a ruse no way near enough supply of waste products 
make biofuels at scale for any foreseeable future biofuels seems to need to be complemented heavily by fossil fuels 
quite simply sustainable even if it looks good on paper while discounting the reality of supply constraints and still 
pollution does not lessen in any way with bios there are rather ways for biofuels actually compounding air pollution 
than carbon electric is the only way we know of that is sustainable for real an electric motor emit 
pollution and lithiumion batteries are the best way we know of today to power those motors even with todays 
and production practices a batterypowered car will emit less carbon during entire lifespan than a fossilburning car will do 
its first six months on the road lithiumion batteries are thus hardly a pollutant compared to combustion engines and 
soon enough not be a pollutant at all lithiumion batteries toxic are you going to eat them lithium is 
abundant element found everywhere on earth it toxic unless you eat it in too a large quantity it is 
used as the active ingredient in some medications so eat your batteries mike stick to the meds amiga figure 
speech take everything literally degrees will displace hundreds of millions of people literally regardless of future advancements of technology 
is not a given and thus not something we can bet our hand on not playing it safe which 
doing otherwise either but if it comes great then we can drive our batteryelectric cars on fusion power but 
on it also the fusionreactor in the sky already works great we just need to hook up to it 
more thanks for the podcast sean please buy in the confusion about electric cars great you got one no 
technique allows your car to be replenished with green energy and start every morning with full commuting without polluting 
the best i think you would do a service by inviting climate scientists who can present a real view 
happening and about to happen also the lid needs to be pried open on air pollution which kills millions 
and will continue to do so until we ban combustion processes altogether all advancements discussed are fantastic but are 
risk to be a bit too little and a bit too late our future is in real danger maybe 
awareness helps us buy some time a fellow physicist figure of speech take everything literally no non scientists seriously 
climate change will cause catastrophic destruction or the end of humanity when nothing remotely close to that is possible 
will displace hundreds of millions of people literally regardless of future advancements of again nothing remotely approaching hundred of 
being displaced would happen in two thousand seventy to where does this estimate come from fusion is not a 
and thus not something we can bet our hand on not playing it safe which not doing otherwise either 
write that we should depend on nuclear fusion i wrote that i was surprised that on a podcast devoted 
the threat of climate change and future energy that there was no mention of either nuclear fission or nuclear 
if you wanted to go deeper into the impact of agriculture on the environment and what can be done 
improve it a good guest to have on would be joseph poore he coauthored a large meta analysis on 
subject that was published in february interesting podcast however subscribing to this rssfeed does not work with vlc media 
there seems to be a a problem associated with redirecting from podtrack to well it works eventually but takes 
minutes to connect just an observation pingback renewable energy reasons for optimism how i see it could anyone mathematically 
please clarify this sc do have part of me that shivers whenever people mention exponentials as a scientist i 
really exponential other than the expansion of the is sc saying here that all the science which uses exponentials 
merely appropriating it from the defacto expanding universe law of nature that just so happens to obey the exponential 
or is sc saying here that all the science which uses exponentials is wrong because it somehow ignores the 
part of the sigmoid process or perhaps something else altogehter comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the 
most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts and ideas
