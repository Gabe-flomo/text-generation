podcast your host sean carroll and in the course of doing many podcasts interesting phenomena arise when i look 
what the comments are and from various sources whether email or twitter or comments on the webpage or on 
or reddit different podcast episodes have different spirits in some sense sometimes big picture right sort of talking about 
ideas from a very highlevel view and more inspirational than challenging right like thinking about things rather than getting 
lecture in them other times we get a little deeper we kind of get our hands dirty we get 
the weeds we try to dig into some specific example of something either way i will get complaints that 
know and you know what i love and cherish the complaints because i want constructive feedback i want to 
what people have to say but honestly going forward realistically going to be a mix of both kinds sc 
today getting our hands dirty going to get into the weeds be afraid think that well this is going 
be a slog or anything like that this is one of the most fascinating episodes i think that done 
on mindscape and perhaps the most useful in a sense i will explain to you in just a second 
guest is karl friston a neuroscientist at university college london and karl friston is by many measures the most 
neuroscientist alive today the most citations the highest hindex all these different quantitative measures of scientific success he is 
practicing psychiatrist and very interested in schizophrenia and he serves patients but he has also contributed to neuroscience more 
most obviously in developing techniques for imaging the brain ideas like statistical parametric mapping voxelbased morphometry i really have 
idea what these ideas are sorry about that sc what interested in is where moved more recently in his 
into the theory of how the brain works and been developing an idea called the free energy principle as 
of a bigger set of ideas called the bayesian brain the idea that what the brain is trying to 
is to model the world around it and therefore develop a little picture of going to happen next using 
inference something you all are experts on all read the big picture or somewhere else bayesian inference is getting 
in and using that data to update your beliefs about the world the free energy principle is idea for 
the brain effectively does that it turns out that calculationally updating your beliefs about the world can be very 
hard the free energy principle is a way to sort of simply and quickly get to an effective view 
the world sc and the basic idea is that the brain is constantly trying to minimize surprise trying to 
a model for all the stimulus all the sensory input that going to get that is least likely to 
surprised by something new happening so that sounds simple but when you get into it when you look at 
actual way supposed to work it actually turns out to be pretty darn complicated and intimidating and famously a 
number of people in a lot of different fields not just neuroscience but deep learning machine learning biologists and 
and a whole bunch of people who have trouble really figuring out what this is all about so i 
think that in this podcast we present quite an understandable picture of what all about sc some jargon but 
explain what the jargon is of course karl understands what all about but i think that able to give 
examples talk a little bit about why the brain would work this way and what supposed to be why 
particular interested in it from the point of view of addressing schizophrenia and other problems and to me of 
biased i know a lot about free energy and entropy and measures of information theory etcetera but i think 
did a good job of uncovering going on here no equations in the podcast but the ideas i think 
out there this is the kind of episode which it really repays listening closely to i think you can 
a lot and learn about something that is really at the absolute cutting edge of modern neuroscience sc i 
want to mention a tiny little announcement that i have a patreon account that you can find on the 
preposterousuniversecompodcast a link to the patreon one of the benefits that patreon users get is that they get a 
ask me anything episode so patreon users ask me questions i try to answer as many of them as 
can and someone on patreon suggested that even though it makes sense that patreon supporters get the ability to 
questions the ability to listen to the answers might be more widely shared so working out a way to 
that every month like a two or threehour episode that i put on patreon and right now it is 
for patreon listeners but going forward going to try to figure out how to make those answers available to 
right now the only way to do it is going to be to go to the patreon page every 
when they appear but hopefully figure out a way to put them into the regular podcast feed sc the 
is that it costs me a lot of money to put two or three hours worth of gigabytes of 
onto the podcast feed because my host is really expensive it gets paid for by the ads not clear 
we can get ads to pay for the ama or not let me know especially on the comments in 
blog post associated with this particular episode whether or not this is a good idea at all whether people 
be interested would it make sense just to include like one worth of answers then you can go to 
patreon page to get the rest etcetera etcetera but i think a different kind of thing not going to 
regular mindscape episodes but it might be a different way to get some ideas out there and talk about 
and with that go music sc karl friston welcome to the mindscape podcast karl friston thank you glad to 
here sc i figured we would talk about this thing called the free energy principle which been investigating and 
for a while now but maybe just to get there rather than just start by defining that could you 
explain what is the problem that trying to solve what is the question that trying to answer by talking 
free energy kf from my perspective trying to find a first principle account of sentient behavior and just very 
relevant because of my background which is as a psychiatrist so very simply as richard feynman says if you 
to understand something got to be able to build it if you want to understand psychiatric patients you have 
in some minimal way be able to build or simulate sentient behavior that goes wrong so basically how i 
into it sc so you were actually a practitioner with patients and the whole background kf oh yes sc 
out of that kf yes slowly but surely yes transferred my angst from patients to students but i did 
an early part of my life in a therapeutic community with thirty chronic sc wow kf which was aneye 
for several years sc chuckle i can imagine yeah okay so so we want to understand how the mind 
how the brain works in part to help fix it when it goes wrong kf the ultimate agenda because 
got seduced away from clinical psychiatry into systems neuroscience and brain imaging and the question became slightly less focused 
more how does the brain work and that became relevant when trying to characterize or analyze neuroimaging time series 
things like functional magnetic resonance imaging or electroencephalography to make sense of these data you have to have some 
generative or forward model of actually under the hood sc sure otherwise just a bunch of time series data 
and neuroimaging is sort of where you made your money as it were right what you did for a 
right kf my day yeah absolutely sc chuckle and thinking about the grand theory of the brain is what 
now so good enough for me to dive into free energy except that you had this lovely story that 
about woodlice when you were young and seeing them scurry around that does set the stage very nicely if 
could tell our listeners that story kf right well that was my first looking back my first sort of 
insight it was a hot day and i i must have been about between five or eight years of 
playing in the garden and just became preoccupied by watching little woodlice scurrying around noticing that they tended to 
sunlight that they ended up underneath bits of rock or wood in the shadows sc in shady places yeah 
in shady places and just looking at this i thought interesting that looks like purposeful behavior it looks as 
they are purposefully in a goaldirected way avoiding the but then there was another interpretation that came to mind 
but you would also see exactly the same phenomenology if they just moved more quickly when they were warmed 
by the so there was a more deflationary account i use these words at the age of five sc 
at the age of five yeah kf the essence of the insight was well a much simpler explanation of 
on here for this sort of very elemental form of selforganization ensemble dynamics a simple explanation things just move 
when hotter and that notion that sort of deflationary simple almost verging on a tautology explanation for selforganizing behavior 
representing itself throughout my education so natural selection i think is a nice example of that if it work 
move in some phenotypic space right through to physics at cambridge and sort of density dynamics and the fokkerplanck 
quantum physics again if not good if it has a high potential just get out of there sc yeah 
you a physics undergraduate is that what you studied kf natural sciences yeah so half psychology and half physics 
quantum physics sc i had no idea so audience i seek out people who are physics undergraduates but i 
them in all sorts of fields kf you are attracted to them sc apparently yes chuckle kf but in 
deflation way just because you move away from people who are physicists sc right exactly but i love that 
of story because an example of what i talk about a lot in the big picture this emergence of 
well purportedly purposeful teleological goaldirected behavior out of things just obeying the laws of physics one way or the 
right kf yeah exactly sc so the kind of thing that you saw in your undergraduate education and even 
i presume in studying the brain kf yes well at its heart that is the free energy principle that 
promoting it is very much the sort of deflationary getting back to the first principles and then rebuilding up 
that and seeing what would this kind of behavior look like in a sufficiently itinerant context how would would 
be for purpose to explain the behavior of you and me or starting at a slightly simpler level would 
be fit for purpose in explaining a thermostat or a virus or something an ensemble of bacteria or the 
so a question of how far can you get from first principles as a principled account of sentient behavior 
we get back to the human brain and of course that is in terms of writing down the dynamics 
mechanics and specifically in mathematical terms it becomes necessary if you want to write down formal models of brain 
times series so an interesting dialogue between the rather selfindulgent theoretical neurobiology side of it what i i often 
to as the work you do at the weekend when the pressures are off and the day job which 
analyzing brain data sc right kf both sides inherit from each other in a very interesting way that constantly 
models of how the brain works and then testing those models in relation to the empirical data you get 
brain imaging which forces you puts pressure on you to actually sort of think the simplest sort of dynamical 
computational architecture that could possibly explain these data when i look at this sentient creature then usually at a 
subject human subject when exposed to these experimental manipulations and yet on the other side the very algorithms of 
or data analytic approaches that you apply to make the inference about is this the right model of the 
or is that the right model the brain themselves now inherit from the theoretical work because if you can 
how a brain laughter sc absolutely kf the best sort of data analysis machine you can possibly have and 
that helps with analyzing the actual data sc has it affected what data you collect kf yes yes i 
true in both senses true in terms of me as a sentient creature in the sense sc an example 
yep looking around and literally collecting visual data as i around the room interrogating your face trying to anticipate 
turn it is to talk whether understood me so selectively sampling the right kind of data to resolve uncertainty 
those hypotheses that are relevant to my behavior at the moment and in exactly the same way as a 
scientist i designed those experiments to solicit the right kind of data that resolve my uncertainty about my hypothesis 
the functional integration of the hippocampus with the prefrontal cortex same stuff exactly the same principles sc good except 
selfconscious that everything that i do analyzing well i mean of course going to be looking in my face 
a different way than looking at the desk in front of you which you see every day right the 
all the new information is much larger for something like that so okay good what is free energy when 
think about it a physicist and i have a definition and i think a little bit different than yours 
a mathematical relationship so i want to clear up for everyone in the audience what we mean when we 
these words kf right so when i talk or when i say i a little bit selfcentered when people 
things like machine learning talk about free energy they mean variational free energy so technically if you were talking 
somebody from machine learning talking about an evidence upper bound they switched the sign in machine learning so often 
an evidence lower bound acronym elbo which confused me for an enormous amount of time i literally thought it 
part of your body laughter sc asking for trouble really kf so a statistical information theoretic concept which licenses 
previous discussion about hypotheses and inferring this and rich information so it scores basically a bound on technically the 
information or the lob probability of some data given a model of how those data were generated so from 
sc so sorry the crucial thing a model and data kf yeah sc and we would like them to 
kf yes absolutely so well just rehearse that absolutely fundamental everything that we talk about either in terms of 
of sentient behavior and the free energy principle as applied to sentient artifacts or in terms of actually analyzing 
rests upon this notion of a generative model generating what generating data generating sensations generating any observables and an 
more simple expression of that is you have to have some way of articulating a mechanics of causes and 
so the generative model causes or is a description of how causes generate consequences and in this instance the 
are sensory observations or data observables measurables kf the causes are the sort of the latent variables features structures 
you want to call them that are responsible for generating those things so central to the free energy as 
scalar functional is a generative model so only defined in relation to a generative model that tells you immediately 
variational free energy is a function of a function of a function and the function that it is a 
of is a probability distribution or a belief sc so this is your brain giving probabilities to the various 
it might experience out there in the world and the free energy is a way of all to say 
those that prediction for what you see to what you actually see and then sort of what measure is 
what does it characterize really kf well exactly as you defined it a measure of the surprise that you 
have and using surprise in a sort of yeah well actually in a folklore sense a folk psychology sense 
literally the surprise of all the self information sc there is a technical version of it which is in 
case pretty close to the folk version kf yes indeed absolutely so the surprise that you would associate with 
bunch of data given a belief or a model about how those data were generated so technically also called 
marginal likelihood or the logarithm the negative logarithm of the marginal likelihood and that marginal likelihood is also called 
evidence and all this rhetoric becomes important because you can gracefully move from one interpretational stance to another one 
making any mathematical moves whatsoever sc right the math carries over kf just exactly the same but depending upon 
you grew up or how you appreciate these quantities or what the rhetoric that you would interpret them you 
a very different look and feel to the fundamental behavior of systems that look as if they are minimizing 
variational free energy so if this surprise is interpreted from the point of view of a statistician so the 
as a statistical organ a little scientist inside your head then if it is in the game of minimizing 
variational free energy its evidence bound that makes it appear as if it is maximizing model evidence kf what 
that mean well it will look as if gathering information in the service of seeking evidence for its own 
and this translates nicely into a philosophical concept selfevidencing so another way of looking at this purely mathematical sort 
behavior is in terms of selfevidencing so you have lovely little phrases like people going around gathering evidence for 
own existence which literally is mathematically a truism sc yeah kf so only one or you can look at 
the other way round trying to minimize surprise so what would that look like if you were in been 
to think about things in terms of information theory and uncertainty well mathematically expected surprise expected self information is 
entropy is one way of describing uncertainty so what does that mean it means that you look as if 
creature or this artifact or this system is gathering information in the service of resolving uncertainty uncertainty in relation 
its model of how we think the world works and in particular how it is situated within that world 
sampling from that world so that brings us back to your phrase earlier on about looking around not looking 
my desk because no rich information there but sc i be surprised hopefully kf just to reassure you i 
my glasses on so i see anything sc it look very surprising to me kf so what is another 
in information theory of articulating the notion of rich information just minimizing uncertainty maximizing the relative entropy as scored 
technically the kl divergence that is part of an expected free energy but put more simply it just means 
minimizing free energy or making moves that will minimize free energy in the future simply means maximizing information gain 
optimizing some divergence measure literally making your mind up in the sense of moving a belief moving a probability 
from one prior belief to a posterior belief and the more information that you have at hand you will 
and the kl divergence will in this instance be greater and a very important part of when you actually 
down the imperatives for action that becomes a very very important part sc and this kind of makes intuitive 
right that our brain would like to carry around with it a model of the world such that it 
looks around and says yes more or less what i would have expected kf absolutely yeah sc and so 
free energy is the difference between what sort of expecting and what seeing so it wants to minimize that 
absolutely sc and completely information theoretic which i need to say out loud because of course the word energy 
in it and as a physicist we have a notion of free energy that a kind of energy you 
use to do useful work and in fact in the thermodynamic system when you maximize entropy minimizing free energy 
vice versa like if you have a box of gas that is in equilibrium it has no free energy 
of entropy if all bundled up on one side the opposite but looking at a context in which the 
is both minimizing a kind of entropy and minimizing a kind of free energy kf a great paradox laughter 
now i shall try to unpack it sc yes kf but we are right in the depths of sc 
weeds yeah okay kf so i apologize in advance so just back up sc pay off later bring it 
to earth worry kf okay then so just start from yeah gone to university learnt that free energy is 
amount of energy that is available to do work not locked into the entropy so the total entropy is 
expected energy minus the entropy so what that would suggest in terms so the first thing to acknowledge is 
the form of the the variational free energy is formally identical to a sort of gibbs or thermodynamic equation 
the same equation kf the same equation the only move you make is you drop constant from the shannon 
all you do sc we set it equal to one anyway so it make any difference in there kf 
difference between us we are speaking the same language and on that view what does that mean well that 
if you now write down the energy as a potential a potential energy and thinking now from the point 
view of a statistician for example the potential energy that gets into the variational free energy well effectively the 
so the negative of probability of getting these data given the parameters of my generative model given all the 
the quantities the structure of my model of what could have caused those data my hypothesis if you like 
is parameterized and quite important so the accuracy is this basically the surprise that we were talking about before 
i should say the way that you described it makes sense having a model of the world we can 
predictions and then we can test those predictions against sensory impressions absolutely spoton and indeed a whole industry both 
terms of data compression and engineering but also more recently in neuroscience and particularly cognitive neuroscience that is predicated 
predictive coding which is exactly that so prediction errors are just the mismatch between what your generative model predicted 
what you actually sample you take the sum of squared prediction errors you weight them by some precision or 
variance that is basically free energy under some simple assumptions about the generative model and the nature of random 
so predictive coding is one instance of the more general notion that in the game of minimizing our free 
kf so coming back to this the conception of free energy in systems that have attained equilibrium what does 
then mean to minimize the free energy well trying to minimize your energy which is maximizing your accuracy but 
the surprise averaging out your ignorance about the parameters and then trying to maximize the entropy now that may 
paradoxical which is why good that you or i apologize because going to have to so just said if 
remember minimizing uncertainty by choosing the right moves that will get the most information resolve the greatest uncertainty looks 
if trying to maximize the information again on the relative entropy but now saying well minimizing free energy will 
a maximization of entropy from the point of view sc yeah kf and absolutely right so the key distinction 
basically what i do at this moment in time will always be to maximize my accuracy or my energy 
terms of minimizing this sort of prediction error whilst at the same time maximizing my entropy keeping my options 
because the entropy that talking about is an attribute of a belief about the causes of my data so 
is not an entropy measure of the brain biophysically sc right not the molecules in your brain that treating 
a thermodynamic system a set of beliefs kf absolutely so these beliefs are then driven to be as broad 
possible entirely consistent with the second law of thermodynamics you know an imperative a drive for disorder the entropy 
increase but the entropy of our beliefs now what does that mean well it basically means trying to find 
low energy explanation for my data whilst at the same time keeping my options open so this is essentially 
this basically not committing to a very precise posterior belief if seen these data then i believe this caused 
so you want to commit to a very precise one so got to find the simplest the most accommodating 
for your data so the paradox if you like in terms of whether trying to maximize or minimize the 
term comes in but i think more fundamentally makes the point that the entropy talking about at the moment 
a functional or a scalar functional of a belief about something it is not the thing that is encoding 
beliefs not the neuronal firing or the molecules or the atoms kf the twist the slightly paradoxical aspect of 
is when you move into the future and when you have the beliefs about the consequences of an action 
looking over there or googling a certain entry or going to wikipedia before you make that action you have 
about how your free energy is going to change and at that point your entropy or your relative entropies 
switch around because the outcomes now become random variables and you have to take an this is a bit 
but a beautiful little bit of techie stuff which basically flips this imperative to minimize these entropy and relative 
when applying it to the system as it is now and as it is behaving when the system looks 
itself saying well how would i have to now act in order to minimize my free energy in the 
i now include basically outcomes as random variables and they get into the expectation operators and suddenly then in 
service of sc minimizing an entropy yeah kf so this sort of yin yang which means that as currently 
my data striving to find the explanations that maximize my uncertainty because i want to commit to a particular 
yet at the same time going in the exactly opposite direction trying to sample those data that will shrink 
uncertainty and then when i find that balance then we have this sort of active selfevidencing sc let me 
to put it in my words and you can tell me if coming close here i mean we want 
minimize the times that surprised you might think well just predict the thing you think is most likely to 
true all the time but if you put probability on that then any time not exactly right hugely surprised 
bad kf absolutely sc so you might say well do the other thing have no beliefs about anything say 
could happen but then in some cases especially when you go through the math always surprised everything that happens 
a little bit unlikely it could have been anything else and so this compromise where you sort of try 
home in on something you think is most likely but you do give allowance for the deviation kf absolutely 
put as a physicist what you could understand what just said as is basically how do we describe systems 
have some itinerancy but they still restrict themselves to a limited part of their phased space or their state 
so not one point sc exactly kf not little marbles or moon rocks nor are we gases but we 
we certainly have boundaries and we have a shape and a form in the sense of those parts of 
state space we could occupy or where the woodlice are running around a structure there so that structure if 
is the case that these sorts of systems exist things like you and me or anything actually exists in 
nontrivial way by nontrivial i mean basically having an attracting set that is just one being in one state 
kf absolutely yeah then there has to be this balance between this itinerancy this sort the expiration of a 
space in a structured way where many regions are visited but some regions are visited more often than other 
and when you start to think about well how would you articulate that mathematically you start to get random 
that inherit from random dynamical systems so what saying is an attracting set out there it is probability distribution 
i measure the probability of finding me at any point in my state space over a very long period 
time certainly not uniform sc no kf i have a shape i have a sc some things are more 
than others kf i have a personality absolutely and yet i am not a fixed point i am not 
in one state so what you are talking about effectively is a nonequilibrium steady state so it is not 
kind of equilibrium steady states that physicists knew and love and know and love and were taught in the 
this is the new challenge of understanding nonequilibrium steady state in open systems that exactly have this delicate balance 
being a point attractor and being completely diffused at the end of the universe if where going sc just 
i did have antonio damasio on the podcast a little while and his favorite word in the universe is 
right the idea of keeping within this tiny little range as much as we can but some flexibility there 
you want to correct me if wrong again but you really want to say that this minimization of free 
and surprisal is sort of the key to unlocking what the brain does right the underlying thing for most 
kf yeah it is absolutely a joke in my group meetings that the answer to any question is model 
usually sc you could do worse kf and certainly when talking about colleagues and research fellows and whenever they 
a question what happens if this is like well get the evidence for that hypothesis and then you can 
your belief about whether it was like that or whether it broke like that or whether that difference is 
play so can i come back with another parenthesis because i think it nicely follows on from antonio focus 
homeostasis of course the roots are much of selforganization to nonequilibrium steady state inherit from the work of people 
ross ashby who made apparent his ideas through the homeostat so exactly the same or the good regulator theorem 
i think this is just my personal opinion i think that physics has a lot of work to do 
a lot of discoveries to be made along exactly these lines where nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is a booming growth 
i try to get my colleagues excited about it but used to doing their things a tricky kind of 
area where we exactly know what the rules are kf a nice way to phrase it i know because 
became a psychiatrist and left the physics behind but certainly surfing the web that preparadigmatic thing very exciting though 
sc oh of course kf because the next thing sc yes exactly kf century physics sc much more comfortable 
you know like in particle physics or cosmology where i was raised you know what the questions are you 
what would qualify as an insight whereas in complex systems dissipative ilya prigogine was a early pioneer here also 
selforganization and we just know what words to use we know what equations to use but i think like 
a fan of these statistical mechanical lenses of which to view these things kf yes sure the only way 
for me it is the only way to write these things down because at the end of the day 
actually have to have a model in code that generates predictions to analyze the brain data so there is 
you really have unless a philosopher or you write books there is sc you need to be able to 
it to a computer and ask it how well doing just do sort of the reality check for this 
here i certainly get that if driving down the street i would like to be surprised as little as 
but it true that also informally i do sometimes seek out new experiences right how does that fit in 
well exactly that sort of paradox the way addressing it technically in the difference between me at this point 
time this moment minimizing my free energy via a maximization of the entropy uncertainty of my explanations or beliefs 
going on now and choosing those actions that will in the future minimize my expected free energy that basically 
that when you talk about the expected freeenergy conditioned upon a particular action move you know looking over there 
driving the car you have this opposite imperative so now you become informationseeking now you become a curious creature 
you become sensationseeking kf but a particular kind of sensationseeking those sensations that would resolve uncertainty about what would 
if i did that of course behind a lot of the ways just described that is a sense of 
as an agent so once you generalize the nonequilibrium physics of sentient systems to write down what might be 
imperative for the way that they act upon the world that they evidence their agency and you make the 
that or you try to prove it can be no other way that they will act in the service 
minimizing the longterm average of free energy in the future then you get this curiosity written into the information 
to resolve uncertainty means going to be sensationseeking now whether a sensationseeking of a banal sort that looking at 
traffic lights or the street lamps to see whether or or whether going to a disco and doing bungee 
same imperative underneath sc but this is the response to the wisecrack that if we just want to minimize 
we would sit in a dark room and not do anything right but how innocent is that move to 
from minimizing surprise to minimizing the expectation value of all my future surprises that seems like a little bit 
a different minimization is that fair which one is it that doing kf well in a minimal sense doing 
sort of touching on the issues that normally come to the end of the laughter kf what is the 
between you and a virus so to cut to that distinction before revisiting the fundaments of minimizing expected free 
in the future it may be the case that certain systems yeah biotic systems creatures basically have acquired the 
to install in their generative models the prior belief that they are free energy minimizing creatures and if they 
do that then they will have the prior belief that the way that i will act will be to 
my free energy that was how you might write it down as a physicist sc i see where this 
going yes good kf if you were a psychologist all say is have the capacity to so all saying 
sc or to imagine kf exactly yeah so you have sort yeah perfect so your generative model is now 
with the capacity to imagine a counterfactual fictive future to imagine the future to roll out possible consequences of 
and of course the consequences of those actions in terms of the observations now are random variables because they 
yet and why you get this reversal suddenly you become a creature that seeks out sensations literally sensationseeking that 
uncertainty you become curious and you go to your discos and you do your bungee jumping at a certain 
so i think an important distinction between very simple attracting sets kf go right back to the moon rock 
so an appropriate description of that nonequilibrium steady state is in fact an equilibrium steady state and the case 
got a pointed trajectory it could have a quasi periodic attractor say the orbiting of the planets but these 
very simple nonitinerant attracting sets that would approach an equilibrium steady state then we move up to systems right 
rocks through you may even go to as far as some not insects but certainly say viruses so things 
plan but they live very effective at occupying our universe and so on sc but they live in the 
in some sense kf absolutely yeah in joe words there is no remembered present there is no imagination no 
they have all the mechanical finesse of a thermostat but very good at what they do so you know 
homeostasis yeah they achieve it kf well a nice beautiful example so even in our own bodies there possibly 
all that actually goes on in terms of physiology and you know which is homeostasis is just this reflexive 
the moment keeping yourself in that attracting set sc right regulating yourselves right kf regulating yourself so those kinds 
systems are distinct i think from systems like you and me that start to plan and have the ability 
generative models do actually span the future and by implication the past they implicitly have a dynamics where the 
actually go quite a long or in their generative model go quite a long way into the future so 
would be a really interesting way to take forward the argument or a response to your question but your 
is just to return to say is it minimizing free energy or is it minimizing the free energy conditioned 
a particular action sc expected yeah kf expected action it is both the degree to which you actively minimize 
uncertainty depends really upon the shape of the attractor that talking about the attracting set that talking about so 
itinerant systems it is possible to sort of write down the density dynamics and work out the probability distribution 
trajectories of action into the future so action is just another state and you can apply fluctuation theorems or 
formalisms to work out a distribution over trajectories of action into the into the future my apologies which means 
technically what you can do now is characterize a given system in terms of probability distributions over courses of 
policies into the future trajectories or paths of action under a model of what would the implications of that 
action have of all my sensory input for example kf and when you write that down there is a 
of showing that that is essentially a description of systems that do minimize their expected free energy in the 
of just minimizing the distance in fact technically the kl divergence between where they think they are probabilistically and 
attracting set sc okay kf so one part of expected free energy there is another part which is all 
ambiguity reducing which kicks in when there are particular constraints on the shape of this probability distribution that you 
i evince just by existing that depends really upon the itinerancy which you can measure in terms of mutual 
or relative entropies between different partitions of the states i was gonna sc laughter probably some details here kf 
comes one little detail all of this rests upon a markovian partition into a markov blanket it all rests 
carving the universe into internal states that are inside you that constitute your internal states the rest of the 
and then crucially blanket states that separate specifically you from the rest of the universe that enable you to 
identified and a further bypartition on those blanket states into active and sensory states so once sc kf compartmentalizing 
different kinds of states that would be necessary to describe a universe in which something exists ie you in 
way that is separable from not you then you can start to write you can go beyond just the 
in terms of entropies of distributions of say an idealized caste or some sort of closed system now you 
to deal with the entropies of a partition and now furthermore got the relative entropies now so suddenly in 
game which is pure physics just now gotta think about the relative entropies you just talk about the entropy 
this ensemble or the entropy of this wave function or this solution you now have to carve it up 
talk about the relative entropies which is where the information theoretic and all the information richness and all the 
or where it all starts to kick in and of course in so doing actually now committed yourself to 
mechanics of open system because the whole point of having the markov blanket is that it enables a twoway 
between the inside and the outside so now by definition in the game of writing down these statistical mechanics 
open systems that have some nonequilibrium steady state in virtue of having an attracting set kf so now the 
becomes what different kinds of attracting set could be and if they are what will it look as if 
are doing in terms of these mutual informations or relative entropies or incertainty resolving pressures are one way of 
the very existence of this attracting set sc i do wanna get more into the markov blankets but i 
quite let go of this transition from living in the moment to living in the expected future i guess 
seems to be without me planning something that appears on the podcast over and over again recently in a 
with the philosopher jenann ismael and when we were talking about free will and what that means that came 
and earlier with malcom maciver who is a mechanical engineer and neuroscientist who has a theory that one of 
steps on the road to consciousness was when fish climbed up onto land and could begin planning in the 
the timescales are much slower on lands you have the ability to plan so i wonder is it possible 
this framework to pinpoint a place in the evolutionary scheme where we flip over from living in the moment 
being more planning animals my personal theory is that with cats chuckle sc because i have two cats my 
are well aware ariel and caliban and i swear that one of them caliban just lives in the moment 
his needs are being met or not and those are the only two states he has whereas ariel you 
see that trying to figure something out about what would happen subjunctively if she did something and her little 
brain is trying its best so sure that cats is an exaggeration but is it as late as mammals 
this becomes important or do you wanna attribute it much earlier than that kf i know but compelled by 
of cats chuckle sc it seems very clear kf everything said in terms of these other perspectives particularly from 
makes entire sense to me the ability to plan suddenly means you have now a space of trajectories courses 
actions in the future and it means that you because you can only realize one deterministic action because action 
actually a physical state of the universe not action in and of itself is not a belief we have 
about action but the action is realized so that realization means that you have to commit to one of 
multitude so a selection process in play which must in some sense speak to the freewill or at least 
it depending upon your attitudes to freewill what it does say is if there is a selection process in 
in terms of selecting an action from some probability distributional beliefs about the way that i am currently acting 
it must be the case that that only applies to systems that actually have posterior beliefs about the future 
cannot yeah kf so a thermostat could not i think be confused with something that might express freewill whereas 
question now is at what point do we have biological thermostats that have this beautiful homeostasis that become equipped 
the capacity to imagine to plan to think and as you intimated possibly even have some minimal form of 
or even self perhaps selfhood before consciousness so i normally recourse to the philosophical notion of a vague concept 
i only recently learned about this this is why i like talking about it laughter sc there is a 
philosophy of vagueness true we talked about that on the podcast but an interesting topic yeah kf so for 
people who like me who know like i was a few months so at what point is a pile 
sand a pile is it one two three four five grains so i quite like that as a way 
moving getting out of the question at what point would you put your cap threshold and i think warranted 
licensed mathematically because even things like thermostats and viruses say predictive coding so predictive coding does not have this 
it have this sense sc maybe define for the audience predictive coding kf well predictive coding is well originally 
in the as a way of compressing sound files a very efficient way of complying with principle by retaining 
most information but in the simplest coding that you can which is another way sc sort of algorithmic compressibility 
yeah that is in fact the free energy principle as well but just written in terms of algorithmic complexity 
minimum measurements exactly the same maths but difference of events spaces so predictive coding as currently applied to things 
the brain is just the notion that minimizing our prediction error sc yeah kf so it talk about action 
it does talk about is how our brains might respond how our decoders might respond to some new data 
they do it by reorganizing belief updating or state estimation in a way that minimizes a prediction error so 
you can predict what is currently being presented currently exactly on the basis of what you have previously seen 
you must have a perfect model of what is generating that signal or that soundtrack or the auditory stream 
therefore you have minimized your free energy or variational free energy or maximized your evidence evidence lower bound in 
of the pure sensory the sentient aspects of it notice that we which is the important we talked about 
gonna do or how we get there sc we talked about that yes right kf so this predictive coding 
active inference or active learning it just talks about how to make sense of data so that would be 
nice example of the sensory part of a virus or a thermostat it can be completely described as just 
the discrepancy take a thermostat for example and now put action back into the mix so you can describe 
thermostat as just minimizing prediction error prediction error between what well between the temperature sensing and its attracting fixed 
sc mmhmm kf so one of these fixed point creatures and got its attracting setting it has its prior 
that the temperature should be like this and all i need to do is to minimize my prediction error 
my free energy i know how doing it but i do seem sc by turning on the heater or 
air conditioning i guess laughter kf in fact it know what temperature is about but it is equipped with 
that will enable it to get to fixed points so in what sense is that planning if you remember 
to argue for a vagueness so i have to answer your question well when you formulate that kind of 
coding in terms of kalman filtering or bayesian filtering which would be the technical or the way of describing 
predictive coding scheme always working with derivatives so always working in a dynamical setting with not just the prediction 
but the rate of change of prediction errors with time so in a minimal sense got a notion of 
future through a linear firstorder approximation sc next instant anyway kf absolutely yeah yeah sc okay kf so what 
meant in a minimal sense that everything has every generative model has a notion of the future just in 
of having a notion of trajectories or dynamics sc yeah okay kf but not quite the same as your 
cat yeah not thinking well if i sit here i look like yeah sc and you can see just 
the level of her capacities but you mentioned action and i think this is a natural place to go 
because you also want to say that free energy helps us understand how we behave is that safe to 
in fact so let me sort of repeat the thing that i read and then again fix it one 
of thinking about what happens when i move my hand is that my brain sort of intentionally gets it 
about where my hand is and then there seems to be a mismatch between where my hand actually is 
where my brain thinks it is and rather than fix my brain i move my hand to bring it 
where it is is kf yeah beautiful sc okay laughter kf yeah i need to fix anything there in 
we should celebrate that because what just described is a modernday recount of ideomotor theory which was prevalent in 
century sc helmholtz kf yes well yeah he did everything so i could say yes sc he was a 
entropy thinker yeah laughter kf there were other german neurologists and natural scientists who focused specifically on there and 
that was picked up by william james on his european tours but exactly what you just said to move 
have to in my mind imagine the outcome of that movement and then just let my reflexes realize that 
outcome which basically was in the victorian era posited as explanation for stage hypnotism that arm is getting lighter 
lighter and lighter and sc i see kf and of course if you believe your arm is getting lighter 
lighter and lighter and lighter and is floating then your predictions about the proprioceptive input that you would get 
your hand was in fact floating can now be fulfilled at a sort of preawareness level simply by reflexes 
your hand will indeed just rise so as much as nearly all the free energy principle actually particularly at 
of incarnations when applied to things like active influence these are very old ideas and you can actually probably 
them back to students of plato but they come through kant and helmholtz sc okay kf very much so 
yeah kf and alongside that sort of perception as was the sort of action as inference basically actions beliefs 
the way i should be yes now i am like and if of course you actually attend to the 
that in fact your hand is not floating then of course it move and which sort of takes us 
the interesting scenario that you must in some sense attenuate the sc prevent yourself from getting that kf exactly 
yeah okay is this is i guess maybe what we have that plato or helmholtz or william james did 
have is the ability to poke inside a brain and see going on there is this idea that action 
driven by a mismatch between model and sensory input verified testable in the brain kf yeah yeah yeah absolutely 
a number of levels but again just coming back to this sort of notion that most of what emerges 
this from a mechanical treatment of the free energy principle was wellknown you know a century ago so what 
are describing are classical reflexes so you know the brain sends down messages to alpha motor neurons and spinal 
that effectively are a mismatch between the intended signals sensory signals from the muscles the motor plant and what 
receiving and then those cells elaborate signals to the muscles to cause them to contract until the signals match 
the way that we move and in fact the way that we secrete our autonomic function works whether our 
works in fact all of our homeostasis works generalized homeostasis works is by supplying the right setpoints to servos 
homeostatic or reflex mechanisms in the periphery what are those set points just predictions of the way i want 
be sc and is the role does free energy have a role here in an optimization problem or an 
maybe mechanism like different ways you could imagine the brain or the nervous system bringing this match between expectation 
reality but is there just a sort there are easier ways to calculate how to do that using free 
kf well the free energy formalism is if you grandfathers all of these particular manifestations sc yeah okay kf 
guess what asking is if i wanted to now describe the biology or the wiring or the time constants 
have to do is to write down the generative model if you remember the free energy is a functional 
a belief and the belief is defined in relation to a generative model so if you can write down 
generative model you can then write down the differential equations of these sort of sensory inactive internal states and 
states you can associate with neural activity active states can be either secretions or it could be physical movements 
an arm and then you will be able to simulate these kinds of phenomena what you can then do 
take empirical data and then change the parameters of the generative model until your simulation of an arm movement 
example or a neuronal response to a perceptual synthesis matches what you observe in terms of brain signals kf 
that in a sense another description of what we already do what neuroscientists do sc okay chuckle kf we 
about the functional anatomy in terms of well how does the brain model its world how does it make 
predictions how does it generate for example in movement how does it generate these motor commands but not motor 
just predictions of what i should feel if i was actually in this position or walking or talking and 
fact a whole industry of not only theories of interpreting reflex arts and the motor system under that kind 
perspective called the equilibrium point hypothesis but also massive debate about the actual implementation of that and whether the 
way to look at things sc i guess i had this impression that you might imagine that what the 
is trying to do is just use theorem it has some beliefs it gets in more data it updates 
beliefs but that is calculationally difficult computationally intensive and calculating free energy is a sort of shortcut the minimizing 
free energy is calculationally easier than simply conditionalizing probabilities kf i see sorry yes moved us into a very 
observation so been talking about beliefs about where we should be and prior beliefs and beliefs about the future 
of course prior beliefs implicitly rests upon a bayesian distinction between prior beliefs prior to seeing any sensory states 
sensory data and posterior beliefs the product of belief updating having observed those data so that is the process 
minimizing variational free energy for example or is it not quite kf if that process of belief updating and 
just connected back to so what we are saying is that there is a gradient flow that is in 
that underwrites a random attractor and that that attracting set defines the kind of thing that we are and 
markov blanket or partition in play so that gradient flow gonna now associate with belief updating on the assumption 
some states and code probability distributions are standing for the parameters of beliefs and once made that move then 
can actually write down the gradient flows in terms of belief updating which is literally taking a random dynamical 
say a system and interpreting the dynamics as belief updating and the belief updating is from priors to posteriors 
so gradient flow in this case is a way of saying moving from where we are a little bit 
to where we wanna be kf yes chuckle kf yeah absolutely well exactly what the free energy actually scores 
covering all sorts of wonderful issues here chuckle sc we gotten to the origin of life yet but gonna 
there too chuckle kf yeah no it was the difference between bayes and approximate bayesian inference where going but 
think actually touching on something which rehearsed previously which is another perspective on variational free energy so just for 
interest once you abandon equilibrium physics what i fondly refer to as physics and you just live in a 
of nonequilibrium steady which implies that there is some attracting set there and you have to explain it you 
then the free energy the variational free energy now starts to have a look and feel of something which 
much closer to a thermodynamic free energy and effectively it scores the divergence between the current state of the 
and the probability distribution it would have on its attracting set sc exactly on the attracting set yeah kf 
its basically how far away am i from my attracting set or my nonequilibrium steady state probability distribution so 
that sense it now looks very much like the amount of energy available to do so look at me 
perturb me i put me in a highly unusual frightening angstinducing situation never been in before homeostatically or conceptually 
i will work towards getting back to my comfort zone my sc yes my happy place laughter kf my 
place my right and in so doing i will minimize my free energy and be working literally on the 
so now to my mind there becomes an almost invisible distinction between the variational free energy in the context 
writing down the dynamics or the mechanics of nonequilibrium steady states with attracting sets and thermodynamic free energy sc 
thats good kf and in fact you can just put a boltzmann constant on and they are the same 
and interesting that boltzmann constant is in the purely information theoretic perspective it now just equips the amplitude of 
fluctuations with units and now you can start to interpret it in terms sc physical measure kf absolutely physical 
anyway that was me indulging myself i know a physicist you like that sort of thing sc no no 
yeah thank you kf but back to the you know why not just bayesian inference and the difference between 
free energy and bayesian inference great questions so if bayesian model evidence is just simply the marginal likelihood of 
of being then one can trivially say just by optimizing the likelihood that i am in this state which 
definition is the thing that i do because how i exist i could describe myself as performing bayesian inference 
so because i can just call the negative log of my nonequilibrium steady state density model evidence and therefore 
i do is in the service of maximizing model evidence the perfect basis of decision it get you anywhere 
a nice thing to say laughter kf so where does the variational free energy comes in well the variational 
energy comes in because it operationally defines called approximate bayesian inference so the difference between bayesian influence that would 
to bayes rule and approximate bayesian inference or variational bayes or sometimes called ensemble learning but probably variational bayes 
the most technically correct term well the difference is that not maximizing model evidence you are maximizing a lower 
on model evidence which means that the thing that you can measure which is this variational free energy or 
negative in machine learning is now always in machine learning always below the actual thing you want to maximize 
is your model evidence but flipped aside and bring us back to physics and the free energy principle so 
negative logarithm of model evidence which is essentially our selfinformation our surprisal can always be minimized as if you 
a perfect bayesian statistician by minimizing something always provably larger than that and the kl divergence or bound approximation 
the variational free energy is an upper evidence bound and if you minimize that then you become an approximate 
inference why approximate well the bound is not necessarily zero sc not saturated yet but it might be easier 
work that way kf the only rationale for it yeah so just that the evaluation of the actual evidence 
partition function if a physicist becomes intractable in highdimensional systems so how do you elude that intractability when actually 
real physical systems that would seem to be able to do this kind of thing well you just create 
tractable bound and who did that well richard feynman where it came from on one reading of the legacy 
russian reading which laughter sc laughter kf on one reading of the legacy of physics for things like the 
energy principle and certainly machine learning that was path integral formulation which introduced the notion of a variational a 
that was using variational calculus was provably always greater than the thing you wanted to optimize so you just 
the bound instead and you get into some nice rhetoric about bounded rationality in economics sc okay yeah i 
thought of that but i guess it makes sense kf not perfectly rational not exact bayesian influence but its 
physically realizable so the key differences sc none of us is demon kf absolutely yes yeah sc but so 
of this conversation and i think for good reason has been in the context of agents or brains occasionally 
but you do wanna be even a little bit more ambitious right and talk about sort of a general 
principle of nonequilibrium systems to minimize their free energy and maybe this has something to do not just with 
nature of cells and organisms but with their origin is that safe to say is that a fair ambition 
attribute to you laughter that minimizing free energy helps explain why life came into existence in the first place 
oh yeah taking me out of my comfort zone now laughter sc surprise kf did i say that somewhere 
it could be me it could be my lenses i want to do that and i may be attributing 
to you kf oh i see well you should talk about that then sc yeah yeah well put it 
way you mentioned markov blankets right the idea in fact we have a bunch of systems in the universe 
have a pretty clear boundary between themselves and the rest of the world and this boundary mediates their interactions 
the world the appearance of cell walls is clearly one of the most important steps in the origin of 
and a literal cell wall is certainly similar in spirit if not exactly identical to the conceptual markov blanket 
the inside and the outside is that safe to say kf absolutely sc yeah yeah yeah kf in fact 
is the metaphor we always use is a cell surface is a boundary yeah absolutely sc but somehow life 
we know it you could imagine that if life were just defined as some complex thing that had a 
chemical reaction and it evolved it need to have cell walls it need to be in a compartment and 
it is as a matter of fact and wondering if somehow being compartmentalized like that affords a special set 
powers to certain chemical reactions to then go and adapt in a crazy world kf yes sure right not 
wondering whether a slightly more deflationary way of expressing that sc very likely yeah chuckle kf in order to 
and to have measurable characteristics in the sense of a have to have a markov blanket so from a 
anthropomorphic principal point of view then it could have been no other way sc well does a hurricane have 
markov blanket kf interesting point been asked does gaia no it very irritating nor do candle flames sc and 
so but yeah so there is right kf oh i see good point yes sc but they have characteristics 
kf do they yes but on a norgodic sense in the sense that they last long enough however you 
say an eternal i think right i think from my perspective that is a really interesting outstanding challenge wondering 
notion of wondering sets resolves that that you could actually have a mark off blanket that renews itself sc 
kf however sc but in some sense one of the reasons why we count hurricanes or forest fires as 
is that not rich with information just doing their thing and even the simplest cell in your language carries 
model of the world around with right and a forest fire does not kf ah good yes no that 
a lot of sense i wish i has said that sc yeah and so somehow i know how life 
some of my friends are working on it i do wonder whether or not we are under emphasizing the 
debate in the origin of life between replication first where you imagine that rna or the information carrying thing 
first and then it sort of wrapped a blanket around it and got energy and got going another camp 
first that said that the actually extracting free energy in the physicist sense from the environment was the first 
that happened and only later did it get imprinted informationally on to rna and then put in a cell 
then everyone agrees that the easy part is making a cell wall just like a bilipid layer that can 
happen automatically so i wonder if not underselling the importance of that thing that without that compartment without that 
the very notion of having a view of the outside world having a model even if very very primitive 
not really tenable if you even have a difference between self and other kf yes sc what does it 
to have a view of the other kf well the deflationary aspect for me beautiful a desert landscape a 
truth to that i really thought about this so clearly you sc i have kf it does strike me 
we use the free energy principal to model morphogenesis and cellular organization it becomes immediately obvious that you need 
and dna as a generative model certainly the case when talking about multicellular organization you cannot get a free 
minimum from coupled free energy minimizing mark off blanket without some shared generative model that is most naturally written 
in terms of some genetic code so it may well sc from an information perspective that makes perfect sense 
dna is good at doing storing the information kf so perhaps you could argue and perhaps you have already 
people have already that yes first of all you need a markov blanket otherwise there is no of the 
we are talking about but if it is the case that just the part of having a markov blanket 
there is a way of writing down the dynamics or the mechanics that makes it look as if there 
a generative model there would also have to be something in the internal states that plays the role of 
generative model kf and it seems quite natural that the things that endure over generations or show that sort 
attracting set with a sort of itineracy that kind of looks like reproduction then what we call rna or 
they may well be that the other side of the coin of having a markov blanket namely i must 
an implicit generative model or it looks as if my gradient flows are a variational gradient the free energy 
and that free energy is a functional of a generative model therefore it must be a biophysical encoding of 
that could be a statement that you need something like rna dna in order to go handinhand with the 
blanket sc well i do appreciate your indulging me there but that may be good then to sort of 
things up we can bring it back close to where we started with going back to the clinic out 
the research environment how does this perspective this point of view of free energy minimization help us understand not 
the brain when working but the brain when not working i recall schizophrenia is something that you might be 
about but maybe other things as well kf yes i mean my personal training and interest is in schizophrenia 
i have to work that sounds awful to say i have the pleasure of working with lots of psychologists 
psychiatrists laughter sc edit that out worry kf who are interested in all sorts of neuropsychiatric conditions so i 
a lovely question because it allows me to make some simple points so if kant and helmholtz and everybody 
that time are right and effectively psychology is inference consciousness is inference and unconsciousness is inference psychology is inference 
psychiatry is psychopathology that tells you by definition that psychiatry is all about broken inference false inference and i 
that in a very literal sense that basically inferring something is there when it is not like a delusion 
hallucination or inferring something is not there when it is like an agnosia or a denial that something exists 
part of my body exists so just extending that notion that nearly every psychiatric and probably neurological syndrome can 
cast as an instance of false inference suddenly gives or puts pressure on you to now derive a calculus 
how the brain works that is framed in terms of beliefs and inference so just a few examples well 
say delusions and hallucinations in schizophrenia those are sc kf poster childs of false inference but also it can 
in a slightly more subtle way like take disease sc okay kf come back to our ideomotor picture of 
and how we move i infer that my arm is going to be over there or i infer that 
the next six hundred milliseconds gonna stand up and start walking now if i make a false inference because 
fail to attenuate the evidence that i am not moving i would never realize that prior belief i will 
form an intention to move once moving fine but if not moving i cannot deny the sensory evidence that 
immobile and of course a classic description of disease and actually if you drill down on the things that 
belief updating at the neuronal level it actually impacts directly the neurotransmitters and chemicals that implicated disease so if 
just generalize this notion of false inference when inference really underwrites your free will selection of what to do 
in terms of predictions about how gonna feel yourself move and talk and think and feel including your gut 
then got a way now of writing down a mechanics of psychiatry kf so in a way that all 
normative schemes do not because actually articulated in terms of probability distributions if you remember all about functional all 
things like entropies and beliefs and relate entropies and uncertainties beliefs about something then now got a calculus which 
fit for purpose to understand false inference hallucinations and perceptions and the physics that gives rise to those the 
underwrites the belief updating that leads to this false inference so in the past ten years hit me time 
time again why it is so useful if not essential to understand sentience in a philosophical sense and the 
of sentience that we have in psychiatry to understand those on a formal footing calls for something like the 
energy principle sc and has it led to any specific tactics for therapeutic interventions kf well i hope soon 
it certainly led and i may be misinterpreting this through the whether i the things that asked to review 
only speak to people that commit or subscribe to the free energy principle i see alternative but from what 
see in terms of being asked to contribute to special issues and what i see in terms of being 
to review for the the specialist psychiatric literature there has been a slight paradigm shift in the past five 
it all centers on something called precision we mentioned that very very briefly before when we were talking about 
predictive coding implementation of the variational approximate bayesian inference via minimizing variational free energy so i talked about the 
weighted prediction errors so what that basically means is that you could have a mismatch between what you predicted 
what you sensed does it really matter sc right kf you know if in the dark if i get 
mismatch between if i thought i was seeing a visual angel what i actually get is darkness does that 
matter because no precise visual information around so i actually now have to see the darkness by inferring the 
the signaltonoise ratio effectively sc the error bars in some sense kf exactly it is exactly the error bars 
of course of the challenge for statistical analysis not measuring the group mean measuring your uncertainty about it but 
people like sort of emphasize the importance of what what just said for psychiatry getting the error bars right 
at the heart of good inference if you break the capacity to get your error bars spot on gonna 
all sorts of false type one and type two errors false inferences inferring things are there when not and 
there when they are kf so where the precision comes in literally this sort of the more precise the 
the error bars the less precise the more dispersed or uncertain you are about something or in particular the 
of the sensory evidence at hand for example or the precision of my beliefs the confidence with which i 
my prior beliefs that have been used to explain these data that themselves may or may not be precise 
but you have to estimate this precision so it looks as if and this is the mini paradigm shift 
was talking about it looks as if in psychiatry nearly all the phenomenology and the psychopathology and possibly a 
of the neurochemistry and psychopharmacology can be explained by failure to encode the precision the error bars and that 
a lot of sense because nearly every treatment or certainly every pharmacological treatment in psychiatry targets those neurotransmitters that 
a modulatory effect kf so they in themselves encode shifts in the beliefs or expectations or averages they encode 
in the sensitivity to sensory input for example so it looks as though those are exactly from the point 
view of predictive coding exactly the biophysical mechanisms that would encode your beliefs about the precision so what does 
tell you well it tells you first of all where you should target your therapy likely to be in 
standard error estimators in the brain so where are they and then you know that once you know about 
neurochemistry and the functional anatomy and the projection systems and the domains of beliefs that are if got anorexia 
beliefs about your body if got visual hallucinations it might be a lewy body disease an organic psychosyndrome but 
same underlying mechanisms should be in place with different neurotransmitters and different possibly neurodegenerative processes so it does give 
a mechanistic focus so you can start to move away from what has if you like haunted psychiatry for 
which is a purely nosological describing descriptive approach to a slightly more mechanistic understanding which started to preparadigmatic chuckle 
there you go kf gonna use it all the time now so when you say is it net currently 
treatment structures no it is preparadigmatic sc got it kf but i guess if you came back in five 
ten years then i think then see evidence of where that turn lead in terms of possibly reinvigorating the 
industry i say that very practically as something you know but it worries a lot of people in my 
so pharma have basically given up on psychiatry and developing psychiatric drugs no money to be made no progress 
is no mechanistic underpinning so about three years ago they basically all just pulled out sc wow no idea 
yeah so there is no active research at all and this is expensive research it is billions not millions 
drugs for schizophrenia depression which is a great shame and you can see why because they know what to 
because no one said gotta be this system or that system or that sc so we all agree important 
just see the direction forward kf yes absolutely yeah and of course they have to keep the money coming 
to fund the research to make the next drug sc but maybe this will propose a direction forward in 
kf that would be the final hope sc cross your fingers the final hope alright i think this is 
wonderful lesson to end on we should all aspire to have our error bars brought in as close alignment 
reality as we possibly can karl friston thanks so much for being on the podcast kf thank you music 
waiting for this one sean i find this stuff not very compelling according to wikipedia friston acknowledged that the 
energy principle is not properly falsifiable free energy principle is what it is a principle like principle of stationary 
it cannot be falsified it cannot be disproven in fact not much you can do with it unless you 
whether measurable systems conform to the as with integrated information theory iit it seems like it attempts to describe 
mind but at such a distance that nothing is resolved like saying the brain is roundish gray and weighs 
three pounds and all details we discover must be consistent with that model neither theory is wrong but leaves 
path forward that tells us more about how the brain works i lie i found much of this episode 
incomprehensible i just make sense of it i think it was intended for an audience that exists in a 
diagram that intersect with mine i really sure what it was about at all usually i have trouble with 
philosophy episodes but this one was even harder to understand than those not sure going on with your mic 
but the sound quality for your guests is poor and often picks up a lot of extra mouth noises 
makes for a very distracting experience listened to your podcasts for over a year and never had this experience 
the last several recordings also i have this issue on other podcasts so i know not an issue with 
iphoneyou sound just like you always have so thinking something has changed on the way your guests are being 
it would be great if you could edit the sound or change your mic set up i used to 
so forward to every new episode but this is starting to be a problem thanks regarding the question of 
the patreon ask anything answers more widely if hosting costs are an issue perhaps a compromise might be to 
just the transcript assuming that that exists like it does for the regular episodes as einstein proved that time 
money so friston confirms that knowledge equals power i really liked this episode for me it was far enough 
from things i know about that there was plenty for me to learn but near enough that i could 
tentative connections i am especially thinking of reinforcement learning where it seems there are similar ideas expressed in very 
language eg see learning an by richard s sutton and andrew g barto very interesting topic but i did 
grasp most of it except for the very general upshot however i find the talk about beliefs udating priors 
the like does not to go well with the aspiration to give a general theory of our mind the 
task of a theory of our mind be to give an account on how the brain manufactures beliefs or 
fact about the world or ourself how in the first place do we come to the stuff that our 
operates on not trying to split hairs and also not trying to smuggle in the mind body problem i 
the real physical problem is how the mind which after all is a bunch of elementary particles turns a 
of elementary particles into information ie how it performs what sean always calls and is the basis for entropy 
energy etc to make sense in the first place we might well be sophisticated thermostates with memories and multidimensional 
and so forth but you can not for instance fool a thermostate a thermostate never errs i find it 
perplexing that our brain is able to produce erroneous assumptions about the world which is also to say that 
if subscribe to the free energy principle there seems no simple way to apply it to psychiatric diseases without 
those in in the first place maybe there is yet another free energy principle acting on the way the 
coarse grains the brain would be somehow self organise such that coarse graining produces the least amount of surprise 
would amount to something like learning a language but then again we rarely learn new concepts or throw away 
ones in favor of better ones it seems that our brain is rather wired to resist such changes instead 
forcing them upon itself lastly i want to also throw in that sentient beings are also curious and seek 
whitehead called of clearly this exploratory behaviour does not aim at minimizing surprise instead it aims to actively sample 
and unknown parts of the world this topic was briefly discussed but i did not really grasp argument the 
behaviour is often said to be at least in part more or less random ie the free energy principle 
also include some randomnes in order to prevent us from going the same beaten trails forever no just came 
to say i would love to hear the ama responses this was a very pithy discussion i really enjoyed 
as always with regards to which organisms have a sense of self and demonstrate abilities to plan into the 
i was reminded of the jumping spider as demonstrated in this youtube link certain species have a clear ability 
assess a potential hunting situation plan a route of attack and visualise a environment in their including their place 
it as they approach their target the urge to anthropomorphise is hard to resist particularly given david commentary but 
sure does look like the spider is closer to a thinking animal than to a thermostat particularly given the 
the spider makes to its approach depending on a given situation httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvudtlvzgmhyk another vote for ama to be part 
the website or at least a i hope it works out i have always enjoyed these podcast but i 
say that this was the most difficult one yet the sound quality made it even harder to understand the 
matter was interesting but i just could not understand what was being said i could not connect with the 
presented it may be just me but i think i would want to listen to another pod cast on 
subject sorry sean hope the next pod cast is better bem sean carroll gosto muito de ler seus episódios 
entusiasmada para este como sempre e dada sua introdução completamente frustrada não consegui acompanhar o diálogo salvo parte final 
concentrada o suficiente mas julgo muito técnico não sei de qualquer forma apercebime sua insistência para esclarecimento de alguns 
como habitualmente que mesmo assim não funcionou obrigada one of the best episodes so thank you sean and karl 
must say i had to listen to the episode twice to understand everything but it so good it is 
to listen to it five times if needed the free energy principle is a fascinating idea i found this 
to map very well to an idea of the fitness landscape from evolutionary biology where peaks of the landscape 
correspond to a set of attractors it seems like the free energy principle and the concept of attractor sets 
an extension of the fitness landscape framework which i hope will allow to include cultural and personal dimensions into 
unifying theory of evolution pingback now a diversion on free energy and the brain tong family all i want 
know is what carol tavris thinks about this podcast for me this podcast it is the quantification of cognitive 
for me without condescension an eye for the evolution of cognition helps to get more out of this podcast 
attracting set is not a point of absolute knowledge of absolute truth it is a spectrum where some outcomes 
less probable but anything is possible this podcast is predicated on the ability of the reader to value variance 
think in probabilities to see spectrums instead of points because that is the reality of life it is not 
points interacting it is spectrums of a waves interacting it is how we deduce our next move it is 
only way artificial intelligence will work personally this is exactly what i want out of these podcasts that is 
want them to be so intellectually rich and on the borders of what i know that it is like 
college lecture where you only of it but it is so stimulating that you are driven to comprehend the 
personally i am not looking for these podcasts to tell me what to think i want them to show 
a new perspective on how to think why that way of thinking is beneficial thankyou sean comments are closed
