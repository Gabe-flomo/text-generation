carroll i want to mess around a lot at the very beginning of this one because probably heard of 
who is sir roger penrose one of the most important and interesting thinkers and scientists of recent years of 
lifetime for sure if you know sir roger penrose as a physicist you might know him as a writer 
popular level books the road to reality the new mind and so forth but he made his bones as 
were in the field of general relativity theory of gravity along with stephen hawking he helped invent the singularity 
the idea that if you get enough stuff in a region of space general relativity says you help but 
into a point of infinite spacetime curvature sir roger penrose has done many other things in addition to that 
as one example early on in the podcast he mentions doing some early work on the nature of infinity 
spacetime and what really referring to is the idea of a penrose diagram which general relativists used to make 
little picture of an entire spacetime roughly speaking penrose diagrams are as important for people in general relativity as 
diagrams are for people doing particle physics sc and not only that roger penrose has come up with the 
triangle the penrose process for extracting energy from black holes penrose tilings twistor theory the cosmic censorship hypothesis many 
extraordinarily influential ideas in general relativity and he stop there with general relativity as you do know if a 
of penrose been working in recent years with ideas in quantum mechanics he has his own basically idea about 
wave functions collapse in quantum theory and the implications of those ideas for consciousness and how that relates to 
and artificial intelligence and all of these big picture of ideas now in my mind the thing about roger 
is that he understands fourdimensional curved spacetime better than any person alive so what i chose to talk about 
our conversation mostly in this particular podcast we do go on to other things we talk about consciousness and 
mechanics for the last half hour or so we could have talked about those for hours more but we 
had schedules to meet sorry about that sc one thing i got to note is that we both got 
on the names of the three people who were the authors on the papers on black hole the laws 
black hole mechanics jim bardeen whose name we forgot sorry jim who wrote papers with stephen hawking and brandon 
about that topic now talking to roger penrose the great thing about him is fearless he has enormously creative 
ideas many of them have been incredibly successful and influential many of them are idiosyncratic many of them i 
with i agree with his ideas about entropy back when i was first learning cosmology i later realized he 
completely correct in his picture of entropy in the early universe and that had a huge impact on my 
so always happy and respectful talking to roger penrose whether or not i agree with his ideas you can 
whether or not you agree or disagree with any of them in particular what the point of the podcast 
is to give you information about what the ideas are the one gotta make the decision about what to 
at the end of the day so this is an extremely fun conversation a great way to start off 
year sc let me just do two quick podcast announcements of course you can always support mindscape on either 
or just directly through paypal go to the webpage to find information about that and like any podcaster we 
getting good reviews on itunes and elsewhere so we have a wonderful list of guests coming up for the 
of but i think of a better place to start it off than talking with sir roger penrose about 
nature of spacetime black holes and cosmology so go music sc roger penrose welcome to the mindscape podcast roger 
hello quite pleasant sc now not only done a lot of amazingly important scientific intellectual work but on an 
variety topics and so usually for the podcast often for the podcast like to focus in on one i 
the feeling that my people will be upset if we hit all the various high points of cosmology quantum 
consciousness so we can spend three hours if you want but gonna try to get the main things in 
but i thought starting with spacetime would be a good thing to do i mean this is where you 
of made your bones early on is it safe to say the first big thing you published the first 
result was the singularity theorem for black holes rp i think true trying to remember the order of which 
were done i had two phys rev letter articles and one was on conformal infinity how one represents gravitational 
by squashing infinity down to a place where you can see it more or less and this is a 
way of talking about things like gravitational radiation and electromagnetic radiation and so on but then i wrote this 
in written in i think which was about black holes except we call them that at that time this 
gravitational collapse going way back to work done by chandrasekhar in the when he was on the boat coming 
england chuckle so i think nineteen or something i remember and he worked hard a white dwarf star would 
a certain maximum mass and if it was more of than that then it would collapse basically sc right 
chandrasekhar limit rp the chandrasekhar limit is what has worked out at that time the white dwarf stars being 
very concentrated so that the mass of the sun might be concentrated in something about the size of the 
but these stars are certainly known the companion of sirius another such stars these are the things that were 
but what chandrasekhar showed was if the mass was above a certain amount which was a bit more than 
mass of the sun one and a half times the mass of the sun then there was nothing would 
it apart and it would collapse down and the question is what happens to it and chandra was very 
about this and less speculating on what happens whereas eddington at the time was thinking is ridiculous that sc 
got a lot of pushback for this idea that there will be gravitational collapse rp yes indeed he got 
a lot of trouble well a wild idea so not surprised actually laughter sc yeah he should get a 
pushback rp yes but of course that get down to a black hole he just said is left i 
he had some sort of idea that it might well a lot of early work which people say there 
this i forget names right on the spur of the moment anyway this early work when people wondered what 
to a very massive object but until general relativity came along it really an issue which was problematic and 
was in the one thousand nine hundred thirtynine when oppenheimer of atom bomb fame and a student of his 
and they worked out an exact model according to general theory of relativity of a collapsing dust cloud and 
was the picture of a black hole that we have now but a lot of people were a bit 
of whether that was really what expect because well there were two things one is the dust cloud was 
material that had no pressure and so it push itself apart at all and it would fall into the 
and it stop itself from pressure the other point was the model was exactly spherically symmetrical exactly the same 
the way around and so that the matter as it collapse inwards would be aimed right at the central 
and so the fact that you got infinite density there was not perhaps surprising and people thought maybe if 
was irregular it would fall in and maybe swish around a bit and then come swelling sc right so 
thought this was an artifact that it is maybe some special thing but not usually what expect rp right 
i think there was an argument about it now i know john wheeler was very worried about these things 
the worry came particularly to a head when maarten schmidt dutch astronomer well dutchamerican astronomy and he concluded that 
was the first quasar and he noticed that the signals from this object well first of all they were 
shifted so that meant probably it was receding from us at a very great speed and secondly it was 
bright and thirdly it had variations in its brightness of the order for a week or so which suggested 
it be much bigger than the solar system and therefore you had this huge amount of energy coming out 
is something like more than the whole galaxy and it was a real problem and the picture which was 
was that you had something which was down at the level that the well oppenheimer and snyder model would 
you have a horizon as a certain point and this would be where this energy would be released at 
sort of scale sc sorry this point about the variability is an important one sort of not obvious to 
but a very simple fun argument rp yes right sc if something varies rapidly then probably not any bigger 
it takes light to travel across the object rp exactly right yes sc and so week timescales the size 
the solar system which is small by massive extragalactic object standards rp right yes so a great puzzle and 
know wheeler was very worried about this and he talked to me about it and he said look this 
got something down at called the schwarzschild this was a very early solution of equation called the schwarzschild solution 
schwarzschild discovered it soon after general relativity unfortunately he died not long after that but it was the first 
of a represented body he was thinking more in terms of a star or something where there was something 
which was matter and the equations changed when you get into the matter and so that there was no 
there but if you imagine squashing the matter down to this radius which is called the schwarzschild radius then 
get into a very curious situation which was described by the oppenheimersnyder collapse model sc and then so it 
a long time decades for people to really appreciate what the schwarzschild solution was trying to tell them all 
rp yes sc a tricky little general relativity question rp right well usually people thought there was body inside 
so you explore what happened when you extended the solution inwards it was the first i think the oppenheimersnyder 
just before the second world war was a first clear model of what could be happening sc right and 
the quasars that you mentioned i mean so a bright object in the sky very far away very small 
this could be a candidate for an ultra compact object that might be what we now call a black 
so is it really accurate to say that that experimental data nudge us theorist towards trying to understand this 
oh absolutely true yes it certainly nudged me into chuckle thinking about this sc yeah rp i thought about 
schwarzschild horizon and so on and think much of it as thing that might be out there usually one 
that if you squash the earth down or the sun down to that size well it would be pretty 
sc right rp but if the thing is big enough and it collapses itself inwards and i should say 
the schwarzschild horizon the size of it the diameter of it is proportional to the mass of the object 
that if the object is much much bigger than the volume which goes as the mass cubed is something 
you the density be so necessarily very large sc and what is the schwarzschild radius for the earth i 
like some very small number rp yeah tiny laughter rp i forget what it is something like a centimeter 
centimeter or something like that rp i remember exactly sc a neutron star with the mass of the earth 
be the size of los angeles or something rp something like that yeah sc a black hole is a 
across a lot of mass in a very tiny area rp oh absolutely yes laughter rp but you see 
know wheeler was very worried about this he said happens do you get the singularity or does it swish 
and come out and it was a big question should you trust the oppenheimer model oppenheimersnyder model or is 
unrealistic because of irregularities and at that time i should say the craziest time was around about i think 
around about that time there was an argument by two russians lifshitz and khalatnikov and they had produced a 
which seemed to say that singularities did not happen in general circumstances sc right rp so that when the 
collapsed if it was a general irregular collapsing body it would swish around it reach these infinite densities infinite 
it would swish around and maybe come swirling out again or something like that so the picture that a 
of people had sc but you were able to prove otherwise and what i love about it is in 
sense maybe this is exaggerating i know the history very well but in some sense what you did represented 
shift in technique in general relativity from finding exact solutions that were simple to making an absolutely general statement 
just relied on the sort of intuitive powers of the theory but made very rigorously mathematical rp no absolutely 
you see other people had found models which required a lot of ingenuity but they had usually had some 
symmetry or something like that and these solutions very beautiful solutions often but whether they were realistic or very 
sc right rp the only other way you could was to use high power computers and work out but 
in those days people have the kind of computers we have now sc right rp and it was pretty 
to get any impression as to what happened in the general case so i started thinking about this been 
about other problems a little bit like this one of them which i never published anywhere was worrying about 
old steady state model sc okay rp see this was a cosmological model that was sort of in vogue 
i was becoming a graduate student and becoming interested in general relativity in a serious way and in cambridge 
i was it was a popular view sc it was a hotbed yeah rp yes that the universe although 
was expanding and the mass sort of got less and less by the expansion this would be mass replenished 
hydrogen gas appearing spontaneously and it was a very beautiful model in a way because as the expansion took 
the matter was replenished and you had a universe which was sort of stable and it remained forever in 
way and some curious properties but the question that i was interested in is could you in any way 
this consistent with general relativity without having to introduce negative energies and things like that and you could see 
well that that be the case if it was very symmetrical but then i started wondering well suppose irregular 
some you quite serious way does this still cause a problem with general relativity and i came to the 
using sort of topological types of arguments that you save it sc is it even possible to give us 
know this is a very intricate differential topology question but is it possible you give a flavor of the 
something like gravity is always attractive and the basic principle rp yes that but it was mainly how it 
on light rays that was the real argument you look at how light rays behave and a bit like 
lens you see you have a parallel beam of light rays and the way that mass acts on that 
to give it focuses like a positive lens so convex lens would cause these parallel rays to focus now 
you have an astigmatic lens suppose you imagine a lens which in both one direction is positive and in 
other direction is negative i mean you normally find these lenses but the way gravitation behaves so if you 
go through empty space then it focuses one way in one direction and expands out in the other direction 
and this is what leads to spaghettification if you fall into the black hole rp yes it squashes you 
the one hand and stretches you in the other exactly right so what empty space curvature does but the 
is if you have combinations of lenses quite interesting you can do this just with ordinary optics you have 
and you put them on an optical bench and if you had these astigmatic lenses what you find is 
if suppose you had one and an another sitting right next to it an astigmatic lens which is at 
angles i mean their planes are parallel but the direction of the astigmatism is at right angles then one 
out the other and so just like a flat piece of glass but now suppose you pull them apart 
you find there is a residual effect which is a focusing effect sc interesting rp and this is connected 
the energy in gravitational waves so the gravity acts like an astigmatic lens but when you have a lot 
them one after the other a net effect which is focusing as though there was matter and this is 
effect that gravitational energy has focusing so i knew about these things by thinking about these focusing effects and 
on and it was using this kind of argument together with topological arguments that you could see if you 
a point of no return and that was a critical point as knowing what that sc right rp then 
would find that this focusing property would be irreversible and you could show that there had to be some 
place inside the object it was collapsing really it gets to a point where you know what happens it 
of stops space time chuckle gives up sc yeah but singular just mean special it means the curvature is 
infinitely big in some sense rp the expectation although the argument that i had directly show that it just 
that something stopping this the space time comes to an end then it stops sc right rp and the 
expectation is that it these focusing effects become infinite and so things just crumble up and you get any 
sc and you necessarily it immediately follow logically that a black hole but you had ideas about that chuckle 
yes true but the argument that i had prove it what we call a black hole it just showed 
you had the singularity you had to make a further assumption which is what i call which is if 
singularities in general are of the kinds that you roughly speaking see them chuckle then you do get what 
i think we now call a black hole but it did depend on this cosmic censorship hypothesis sc right 
is still not completely proven is that correct rp i think correct yes a lot of evidence that true 
think in general well the argument is that it has to be you look at general situations sc yeah 
then you can cook up special examples which disagree with it but not realistic sc so the astronomers with 
data prodded you to think about this problem and rp absolutely yes sc you proved something did your proof 
the astronomers to take black holes more seriously rp it did eventually chuckle it was quite interesting because you 
see somehow a huge amount of skepticism about black holes and i used to be asked to give lectures 
these texas symposium which happened every i think every year at first and usually i was asked to give 
talk something about black holes and you could see gradually people beginning to take it seriously and more of 
of me but a oomph it sort of went over to the other side it sort of happened very 
once enough people got used to the idea sc and then i mean on the theoretical side black holes 
a whole area of study and stephen hawking and brandon carter and other rp yes indeed yes right and 
result about the fact that they do a very tiny amount of radiation and so if you imagine in 
very remote future of the universe and these huge black holes well you see now we see huge ones 
there were just the odd double star system where you would see one star and other one it seems 
be going around something else that you see sc right rp but maybe there was some plain where material 
coming out if you see the object itself and so people speculated that that was a black hole the 
was pretty indirect for a while but now the evidence is well indirect in a sense that you actually 
directly into the hole but you see like in our galaxy we have what we call a supermassive black 
which is about four million times the mass of the sun and really remarkable you can see these pictures 
you have to speed a little bit chuckle sc yeah sc but not that much and you can see 
going around in these sort of elliptical orbits and nothing in the middle chuckle sc yeah going around a 
heavy thing that you see chuckle rp yes right sc although you see except not that big a small 
heavy thing you see rp right pretty small by yeah right well four million solar mass not sure quite 
big that is but not huge sc less than a light year right yeah very tiny rp yes yes 
but so when hawking circa argued that black holes are not completely black given if you take quantum mechanics 
account they radiate how did that strike you was that a controversial at the time rp i can tell 
exactly what happened you see i think i was away from sorry i was working in cambridge at the 
no yes it was no when was this that was it rp early yeah rp i must have been 
oxford by then sc but you and hawking had become close and work collaborators rp oh yes no i 
him well but the point was come back from somewhere chuckle exactly where i remember i have to work 
out but dennis sharma you see who is a great friend of mine and i learn a lot of 
from and he was stephen supervisor and dennis was a great person for getting the right people to meet 
other and so on people who might benefit from encounters with other people and he knew all the physics 
was ground around so i learned an awful lot of physics from dennis but anyway i come back and 
told me have you heard the latest stephen hawking has showed that black holes and i said laughter rp 
i got i phoned him up you see i phoned up stephen and i said this all and he 
tied in with the ideas about and i said makes a lot of so no it take me long 
come to the conclusion it was probably right what he said sc well to be fair to the audience 
had previously shown that you could extract some energy from a rotating black hole but a limited amount and 
had to do it intentionally rp yes sc i be automatic but that kind of pushed people on the 
to think about these questions rp yes right that you could get stuff out in a sense you could 
energy out of it but this was going a little further it was curious now i must have been 
oxford because i remember how this came about we used to have these meetings every friday in my office 
oxford with my graduate students post docs and people interested and if somebody was visiting had have them dig 
a nice little talk and stephen was visiting at the time and he was telling us he was imagining 
black holes which be might be created in the big bang and the idea was if they were rotating 
they lose their energy in the rotation and he showed some calculation about this and it was actually not 
long after that you see i must have been i remember exactly how it was i saw dennis at 
point but i phoned stephen up and it was really following up on this calculation he had done previously 
the rotating ones and i think that he found that they need to be rotating sc right rp which 
surprised him sc yeah every black hole does it right sc yes right sc and i think that in 
famous textbook by kip thorne and also misner and wheeler this picture of an advanced civilization that has built 
energy extraction device around the supermassive black hole at the center of their galaxies a lot of energy we 
in principle get out rp absolutely sc free from our dependence on foreign oil sources if we could really 
black holes this way rp that was the idea well you see this was the argument i wrote a 
in an italian journal there as a conference in italy somewhere i forget where now chuckle and there were 
talking about very massive stars and so on and i asked to give a talk on black holes which 
did but i had come to this conclusion that you could extract energy and i imagined that you could 
this by having particles which would split up into two and so on but when it came to the 
which way round was it i think i did give it that way around but i thought about also 
the civilizations rotating around the whole and extracting energy out and there this simple argument you can see they 
do this from quite general principles they just lower you know fill buckets full of rubbish and lower them 
the whole and tip the rubbish in and they would extract more energy than the mass of the rubbish 
it goes there sc and when hawking did explain that black holes give off radiation this all came as 
of this as you mentioned thermodynamics rp yes right sc like this package that black holes have entropy rp 
sc and there was this sort of analogy between what black holes do in the laws of thermodynamics and 
really said not analogy black holes have entropy rp right well it was curious because you see the entropy 
a black hole it was really bekenstein had had a fairly rough argument but i was quite happy with 
because it seemed to be very consistent that the area of the black hole should should have an entropy 
that argument looked pretty convincing to me but stephen then had a much more exact argument and which was 
impressive mathematically but this came after a lot of discussions between stephen and brandon carter and who was the 
one sc i know the paper talking about laws of black hole but tell the audience afterward laughter rp 
tell the right people give you a set i think there were only three people maybe there were four 
yeah rp but they were exploring the analogy between thermodynamics and black holes but stephen definitely just thought it 
an analogy i remember talking to him about this and i was sort of thinking it was real you 
sc mmhmm rp but you see in a way been looking more deeply into it than i had because 
realized if it was really thermodynamic then the black holes had to have a temperature and sc and we 
know not true sc not the case yeah they just swallow things no way it can have a temperature 
see sc right rp but then he found that they did sc i think that in brief history of 
mentioned that he was literally annoyed at bekenstein for suggesting the entropy was real and that motivated him to 
this laughter rp interesting i quite realized it was that argument but right sc did that help get you 
in entropy because it was just a few years after that that you started talking about the entropy of 
early universe rp it must have done have to try and put it together but to be able to 
a value to this entropy that that was crucial for that you see i quite remember the order of 
thinking here but a suddenly something which i had played around with a lot was thinking well i thought 
it in the steady state model you see and issue of entropy balance troubled me you see but there 
see you had this creation of the hydrogen which the fact that it was condensed you see and formed 
could be a source of the entropy and source of low entropy i should say a reservoir of low 
so how sort of squared itself in my mind with the second law issue been worrying about it then 
but when that had to be given up and one was looking at models which expanded and have creation 
matter at some point i was worrying about this question but it really have substance to it until the 
entropy well bekenstein and hawking entropy value for black holes and how huge it was sc yeah so i 
to be very fair to all of the audience listeners entropy heard the word before but roughly speaking a 
of how random disorganized a certain system is rp sure sc and in some sense intuitively you might have 
that a black hole has zero entropy not a lot of different ways a black hole can be right 
like a cup of coffee where there is a lot of arrangements of the atoms inside but hawking and 
show that actually a huge number and that inspired you in some sense to start writing the second law 
thermodynamics says that entropy tends to increase in closed systems and therefore not surprising that entropy used to be 
in the past rp right sc but cosmologists have a long history of being confused about this issue laughter 
yes they have sc and i think just be honest that this is the most profound there has been 
a profound effect that you have had on my career because it was your papers emphasizing this problem of 
the early universe had such a low entropy which i thought were completely convincing and puzzled by why my 
cosmologists take this seriously so why you explain how you think about this rp you were one of the 
people who really latched on to it immediately but i was just as puzzled why people take it seriously 
the basic argument is this as you say i mean the entropy or the randomness if you like increases 
time and the second law another way of saying exactly the same thing is as you go back in 
it decreases so as you go back and back and back in time you should find the entropy very 
now the earliest evidence that we directly see of the universe in states the cosmic microwave background so this 
radiation coming from all directions electromagnetic radiation and this radiation has a lot of entropy in it but the 
point that gonna sort of concentrate on here is if you look at the curve which represents the intensity 
different frequencies you have this thing the curve goes up and then comes down again and it called the 
curve sc the amount of light at different wavelengths rp right so a certain temperature where its maximum and 
the radiation at higher frequencies it goes down and this planck curve is observed the cobe satellite when it 
up have to tell me the dates i remember chuckle sc yeah rp okay the cobe satellite measured this 
the intensity for different frequencies of this radiation they found an extremely good fit an almost perfect fit to 
planck spectrum what does the planck spectrum tell us it tells us what looking at is maximum entropy i 
the whole point of it what they call the black body radiation which meant maximum entropy so here this 
what i call the mammoth in the room chuckle and you go back and back in time where the 
is supposed to be going down and down and down until it reaches a maximum chuckle rp which is 
of the wrong way around sc right chuckle rp and i know why people worry about that more but 
point is the i think partly because muddled up with the expansion of the universe that people sort of 
well the universe is expanding and so maybe not much room for entropy down or something like that sc 
think partly that and partly that when taught thermodynamics gravity is not a part of it right rp yes 
think right yes sc we think about black holes and so forth rp i mean there were people like 
one of the early mathematical physicists who studied cosmology and he understood pretty well about the entropy issue so 
certainly did understand it the right people at that time but anyway yeah you got this huge amount of 
in the radiation which was a lot actually and then why does that second law hold when it starts 
at the top and got no where to go if you like chuckle and you can have to convince 
that the expansion of universe help sc right rp which is the point tolman did understand but the other 
you see got this radiation coming from all directions in which it has this thermal character but the other 
about it is also very uniform so almost completely uniform over the whole sky if you take account of 
motion through the radiation it is uniform over the sky to about one part in so really pretty uniform 
you see what does that indicate you say suppose you have a gas in the box then the temperature 
be pretty uniform if at a maximum entropy stage just leave it in the box and the temperature apart 
gravity and all that stuff it would be uniform temperature so that also finds represents high entropy so where 
it low well low if you think of not a gas in the box but suppose you you think 
a huge box of galactic scale and got stars running around in it rp now those stars will tend 
clump because of their gravitation attraction and eventually become black holes and as they do this the entropy goes 
up particularly with the black holes because as we know from bekenstein and hawking the entropy is absolutely enormous 
that represents an increase in entropy so you have these two things about the early universe one is the 
spectrum which tells you that the matter and radiation you see the planck spectrum was telling you that the 
stage of the universe photons and matter were a kind of at maximum and randomized as much as they 
be and so that radiation comes to us and you see this planck spectrum but the other feature about 
is that uniform and that as far as gravity is concerned is very low entropy because as things start 
clump and a good example of this is our sun you see our sun used to be well a 
time ago chuckle a distribution of gas all over the place and it went through various stages but it 
clumped together and produced this hot body it would be hot even if there were no thermonuclear reactions at 
rp so it gets that heat which when compared the darkness of this background sky is a very low 
situation you can get energy out of it by sc and we do laughter rp we do absolutely why 
the plants do by photosynthesis and we live off plants and animals that eat plants and so on and 
where it all comes from so it comes from the fact that the a hot spot in a cold 
sky and this is why we are interested in the second law of thermodynamics because low and creeping up 
is what we get our structure from and all that stuff sc so ultimately the cosmic microwave background it 
like a maximum entropy but only you forgot that there been all these lumpinesses which made the entropy much 
i think true the entropy of the black hole at the center of our galaxy is larger than the 
entropy of the cosmic microwave background rp that could well be yes and if you look at it thinking 
the stars all the galaxies that are around absolutely enormous the entropy in the black holes is absolutely stupendous 
comparison with anything else sc so this is very good news for the second law of thermodynamics it explains 
the early universe had a low entropy actually not a maximum entropy rp right sc bad news for cosmology 
with this question of why the early universe is like that rp exactly sc a lot of cosmologists like 
theory of inflation proposed by alan guthe around and you were one of the first gadflies there saying the 
is a bit of a cheat i think rp yes well you see i thought this is a crazy 
it last a week and how wrong i was laughter rp now i was completely wrong it just seemed 
me such an artificial theory you had to invent a special field well you see in the old days 
called it a higgs field because they hoped that the higgs field would be the same as but that 
sc we should explain the basic idea is that the universe underwent in very very early times a period 
super fast accelerated expansion which i think you would agree true that if that happened and if the energy 
that expansion turned into matter and radiation it would give you a universe looking like our universe but it 
explain the initial conditions rp yes it because gotta have a pretty uniform already otherwise it even work sc 
rp so gonna have quite general arguments to show that it really be the explanation of the just not 
the low entropy in the early universe this particular form that low namely in gravitational degrees of freedom and 
strongly strange why you can see a list of what are the problems of cosmology and you look down 
list and say is chuckle sc yeah i am totally on your side there but so both of us 
in the small band of people been trying to invent models of the universe which naturally explain this early 
but where we diverge so i think that i would honestly give it a chance of being part of 
final answer rp a lot more than giving it laughter sc exactly but a lot lower than all my 
give it who are professional cosmologists rp oh absolutely yes right sc and been working very recently on a 
model of the universe on its super larger scales rp right or recently even all that recently i forget 
over ten years anyway sc okay rp but nobody paid well you see it took me a long time 
used to lecture let me explain the model first sc please rp the argument is that think of the 
ends of the universe we have this future which seems to be dominated by this exponential expansion so this 
observations of supernova stars and other things together which persuaded cosmologists enough to give the two groups the nobel 
chuckle which was very deserved to see that the universe is having this called an exponential expansion a sort 
the range of expansion is proportional to the size and so on so something which used to be taking 
now those of us who were brought up on cosmology and read the cosmology books would have seen that 
kinds of models of that exponential expansion are perfectly well described in the books these are models in which 
is a thing called the cosmological constant which is positive and usually referred to as a lambda a capital 
so like a v upside down sc right basically the energy of empty space rp well you can think 
it as energy people call it dark energy yes yes not sure happy with that term but nevermind chuckle 
well explained by this excuse me by this einstein cosmological constant einstein introduced this term in when was it 
rp for what was the wrong reason he wanted a model which was static he hoped that the universe 
static i thin a sort of appealing idea the steady state model as again the same sort of appeal 
appealing in some way sc to be fair i think it was also the observations at the time the 
looked static to astronomers in rp i guess hubble quite sc right that was rp but it was i 
it was after the vesto slipher it vesto slipher had already seen the expansion maybe it as a convincing 
sc well you saw that there were you saw that there were objects that were moving away from us 
yes i guess sc we know if they were far a way rp yes true it probably terribly persuasive 
there was some indication but not enough to rule out a model rule out a model like einstein and 
one he produced then before that model he needed this term and the only thing you can really do 
equations without wrecking them in my view you just add this term and he like to do this at 
but then after i guess he thought put it in and then they get a static which we refer 
as the einstein cosmology but then not long after that hubble showed pretty convincingly that there was this expansion 
proportion to the distance so the whole universe seemed to be taking part in this expansion and so einstein 
guess kicking himself for not having stuck to his original equations which seemed to indicate he would have predicted 
chuckle sc he could have become famous yeah rp he could of become famous yes well he considered this 
his greatest blunder and i think true on record gamow has recorded einstein having said this so okay this 
all in the cosmology books despite einstein retracting it and yeah people i studied it i studied and looked 
see what the infinity looked like in this model and so on so i was familiar with it although 
was a bit slow on the uptake to taking it seriously i think it was jerry ostriker who told 
i said maybe these distant supernovae look red because of dust and so on which people thought maybe it 
the case and he said no there are all sorts of other things got not just chuckle rp have 
take it so i thought okay take it chuckle and it i know how long after that conversation that 
began to think about the remote future now you see the remote future and i mean the very remote 
we have the universe expands and expands and expands and it gets more and more rarified and nothing much 
you get dead stars and it gets pretty boring and the most exciting things that are around are these 
holes but pretty boring too you sit around waiting for it to evaporate according to evaporation and for the 
ones it takes about a google year something like that so thinking about ten to the one hundred years 
with a hundred zeros chuckle sc yeah rp that number of years sc a long way rp yes and 
awful long time so i regard that as a pretty boring area wait for that but then you see 
gone off pop by hawking evaporation now the very boring era chuckle sc not even black holes yes rp 
i mean i think of anything more boring than that and i admit this is an emotional argument but 
just seemed to me for our universe it you see sc right rp forever and ever just an eternal 
you see chuckle sc well it is weird and i think that cosmologists underemphasize how weird it is we 
talk about the last fourteen billion years of the history of the universe the past what observed and we 
a long time and so forth but our best current models say we have infinity years toward the rp 
sc which is a rather big imbalance rp and yes in terminal in terminal boredom sc yeah rp well 
see then i began to think gonna be around to be bored by and then i thought pretty well 
damn hard to bore a photon chuckle rp actually i expect you to have actual experiences so boring is 
not an appropriate term sc again to be fair i did interview david chalmers on the podcast and he 
that photons can have actual laughter sc just a little bit so maybe think about the feelings here take 
into account rp okay well that helps me a little laughter rp because they still get bored they get 
because if you take relativity now this is just ordinary oldfashioned special relativity without the curved space time and 
that it matter curved or not the photon because it travels at the speed of light the time is 
stretched out and nothing so right from its creation in some particle decay or something this photon goes out 
infinity and it experiences zero time so not bored in the sense of forget about whether it actually has 
or not laughter rp it experience the passage of time now this is the sort of thing i used 
play around with when thinking about gravitational radiation and how you put boundaries on space times and so on 
it was a useful way to think that this boundary is something you could imagine going through and if 
were a massless thing when you hit that boundary you say where the hell am you see chuckle got 
be something on the other side you might think i mean only a way of thinking i think it 
seriously that way sc so just to get this correct in minds this is a boundary that talking about 
is literally infinitely far away but saying the photon experiences zero time rp yes sc it gets there chuckle 
exactly right but i think very useful if you have seen these pictures by the dutch artist mc escher 
very famous one with angels and devils and they in the middle you can see the angels and devils 
and then you go out a circular boundary and they seem to get smaller and smaller and smaller and 
crowd in on that boundary now this is a representation of a kind of geometry which is called a 
geometry and if you think of those angels as really all being the same size as each other and 
devils all the same size then although it looks to us as though they get smaller and smaller to 
all the same size sc and did you have something to do with inspiring that escher rp no that 
relation to escher was something chuckle somehow a little different but that was coxeter it was the same meeting 
this was in the international congress of mathematicians in whenever it was early i think sc okay rp and 
the mathematician coxeter who wrote to escher and said you might find this interesting to you see laughter rp 
no that was amazing sc so a representation in the spirit of what you did for spacetime in general 
where you can express infinitely far away things in a finite piece of paper rp exactly what it is 
the thing about the escher picture is called conformal so that means that small shapes are accurately squashed down 
look at the eye of the devil if you like got a certain shape and no matter how close 
the edge you get it retains that shape smaller so squashed in one direction and equally well in all 
directions so called a conformal representation so a conformal picture of an infinite universe but where you see infinity 
a finite at a finite place now you can use the same trick in cosmology but then thinking of 
and not space and what conformal means is that you preserve the speed of light if you like the 
the light cones which tell you how the speed of light goes or how light goes and so this 
down of infinity if you are light you notice the difference in fact a more general thing if you 
any mass you notice the difference sc if you move at the speed of light rp at the speed 
light and also a factor not thinking of particles but of fields and the electromagnetic field which light is 
feature of electromagnetic fields this is famous equations and these equations of maxwell again are insensitive to the scale 
you can squash it and stretch as long as you do it equally in both directions in the spacetime 
means you squash the time and the space equally then that kind of transformation is not noticed by light 
not noticed by the maxwell equations sc right rp and true also of the yangmills equations of particle physics 
physics sc so these are the nuclear forces the strong and nuclear force etcetera rp right they all have 
except for mass so gotta be careful gotta get rid of things which may disturb the but the equations 
as classical equations are completely insensitive to the scale so anything which have mass that boundary which just drawn 
like anywhere else now infinity you see well not quite because we have to worry about the black holes 
the black holes eventually decayed away so we got rid of that too chuckle but the other end you 
the excuse for stretching out the big bang to make it look now the excuse there is not an 
because most big bangs work sc wait sorry i think maybe we skipped a step or i just paying 
attention but been explaining the future and it has a certain nice remarkable mathematical properties rp yeah sc and 
move is to relate it to the past right to say like the very past of the universe kind 
looks similar maybe we can make some money off of rp exactly right now you can use a similar 
but the opposite way around so in the future you have to squash it down like the escher picture 
the i was trying to find an escher picture which did it for it quite chuckle rp there are 
which almost do it but if you go into the past you can stretch it out now all the 
cosmologists the ones what friedmann and lemaitre and robertsonwalker the cosmologists the models that most most cosmologists play with 
have the property that you can stretch out the big bang in those models to make it nice and 
but almost all models if you think of what possible things they could be in equations a great mess 
the beginning and they have a nice smooth big bang but those ones which do have a nice smooth 
bang are ones that you can stretch out and make it a nice conformal boundary and those are the 
which you could say that the gravitation degrees of freedom are killed off right at the beginning so you 
a nice picture with entropy low in gravity but not low in anything else and so being able to 
that trick is seems consistent with what we seem to see of the universe rp and my former student 
colleague paul todd used this as a criterion for the kinds of big bangs that one might be interested 
but you can stretch them out in this conformal way now you see look at the argument here you 
to say in the future because got some masses things around in the well you see the argument is 
of similar but not quite the same there you have very very large temperatures get hotter and hotter the 
you get into the big bang that means the more and more energetic the particles are and when they 
very energetic in the sense of their motions kinetic energy and that completely swamps their masses sc effectively massless 
yeah so effectively massless so really around the big bang everything is pretty well massless so sort of reasonable 
to do these tricks at both ends sc so what suggesting what called it is a conformal cyclic cosmology 
yeah sc you think our universe has an infinite number presumably of cycles rp yeah might as well chuckle 
where you go from big bang to stuff like us to the future and then repeats rp yes well 
idea is that our big bang was the conformal infinity of a previous aeon i call it an aeon 
like not to call our universe because all entangled with each other and a part of one big thing 
our aeon aeon i like to think of it as began with a big bang and ends in a 
with it squashed off infinity but if you apply the stretching at the beginning and the squashing in the 
you get a thing which looks a bit like a cylinder and you can imagine that joining on to 
tube which was the previous aeon so its most remote future conformally smoothly fits on to our big bang 
and one of the exciting aspects is it might be observationally testable rp absolutely well there are some new 
on this at first i used to give lectures about this and said is fun and i can go 
talking about this and nobody will ever prove me chuckle rp because we have any way of seeing whether 
or not but then i started having an idea maybe one could see a test and so the first 
i thought of was what about black hole collisions you see our galaxy has a supermassive black hole in 
center so four million times the mass of the sun i think the andromeda galaxy is what about twenty 
bigger or something like that and we are in a collision course with it not very near in the 
but you have chuckle sc thinking big here rp yes right sc professional cosmology chuckle rp but eventually these 
holes galaxies collide and the black holes will feel each other out take a while finally spiral into each 
and there will be one whacking explosion which will carry away a significant proportion of the rest mass of 
combined black holes and that will be gravitational radiation primarily likely ligo detection of the black holes that seen 
very proud of and now this is a far far bigger explosion rp right rp we might be lucky 
see such a thing in a very distant future i well just in the future i know rp anyway 
explosion would carry out to the crossover between one aeon and the next and you have to look at 
equations now you see you need equations to do the gluing job from one to the next and okay 
can produce equations which have nice behavior and they indeed kill off the gravitational degrees of freedom but they 
it i mean the degrees of freedom survive but not as gravitational waves they come through as disturbances in 
newly created dark matter so you have to to make the equations work you have to we talked about 
energy but this is dark matter and that seems to be some real substance out there but in this 
got to be there got to be where the degrees of freedom of gravitational waves get picked up and 
into this form on the other side and these would produce signals that could be seen they will look 
circular features maybe concentric ones because in a cluster of galaxy be a lot of battles between black holes 
each other up and then end up with one big whacking one in the middle of the cluster and 
one that finally you get sc that eventually evaporates rp right but there are claims and arguments about whether 
see these rings i think the most persuasive argument was from my polish colleagues they had a first looking 
the wmap satellite and then the later satellite which is planck satellite which did some very very precise measurements 
cosmic microwave background with radiation and they claim to see signals of this nature with the confidence this is 
at the planck data with a confidence level of nevertheless people pay any attention laughter sc i mean have 
argued against it or are they just asking about it excited rp i know very strange because i mean 
had a lot of trouble with referees who said you better this and then if we believe you got 
this test that they did them all the polls were this is krzysztof meissner and pawel nurowski well daniel 
who is a korean who did the analysis in that case and in the planck data command they came 
this conclusion of confidence using all the tests but the editor said more or less afraid gonna have to 
your laughter rp all the complaints people sc right rp you should say in the initial part of the 
this might be a chance sc always possible yeah rp it could be a chance effect sc but this 
the good news is in the data data hopefully will improve made a prediction people will figure out one 
or the other rp yes but more exciting is happened more recently sc okay rp you see this is 
same more or less the same team the polish team with daniel an and they were doing a slightly 
sophisticated analysis which came from a discussion i had with krzysztof meissner you know maybe you could refine the 
and see what the shapes of them are and so on and they then found a particularly strong signal 
some very small ringlike structures and this was puzzling to me at first because it should i mean they 
some evidence for the bigger ones but it seem nearly so impressive as the small ones but then it 
to me that i had thought about this before but not really dared to think about it seriously which 
the question of what happens to these super massive black holes see any cluster will end up with a 
whopping great black hole in its center this will gradually gradually decay over something like a of a hundred 
google years sc i mean sorry in fact any cluster turns into a whopping big black hole right rp 
well yes i think pretty well all the matter gets swallowed i know exactly what proportion it is but 
would expect i would guess pretty well most pretty well all the matter gets swallowed up so got this 
hole sitting there and it sits there and eventually it decays away by hawking evaporation now you see hawking 
is a very cold most of it and you know you could pretty well ignore it chuckle enormously long 
length and you can ignore it but as a total it carried away the entire mass of that super 
black hole and where does that mass go well you go think about the escher picture again you see 
have an event which is taking place right up near the edge of that boundary and that means all 
radiation which comes out is concentrated right at one little point so you would have according to this cyclic 
what i refer to as a hawking point you see the hawking evaporation and these hawking points would be 
release of an enormous amount of energy right at that point and then it will spread out through about 
which is the time between the big bang and the last scattering surface where you see the microwave background 
and the amount it spreads out is to well four degrees which is about eight times the diameter of 
moon so it looks quite a sizeable thing but pretty small on the basis of looking at the whole 
so imagine spots of that size now we see them quite that size because our past light cone cuts 
a bit of it so a little technical point but comprable at that size they maybe say five times 
diameter of the moon or something like that but this is just the scale in which the latest analysis 
seem to see an effect and this would be regions i mean they look at rings and you imagine 
ring surrounding the hawking point and in the middle heart and then it cools down as you get towards 
edge of the ring as the energy gets dispersed through this period of time from the big bang to 
years and that spread you can see concentrating in the middle and spreads out and completely consistent with that 
and now the latest thing which is just about i think now on the archive the latest version of 
article is given a confidence level from the looking at simulations and things of confidence now this is just 
out there on the data anybody else can look and if they see something else we will have to 
why why we all see a different thing but the evidence seems to be out there and it has 
confidence level is complete clearly calculated at now one of the real problems for inflation of this is that 
point you would be seeing not the big bang inflation would be called the graceful exit moment so inflation 
the inflationary okay started very close to the big bang and then this huge expansion took place and most 
which happen in that region of this huge inflationary expansion would be spread out to an enormous size rp 
only at the very end would you get something which is restricted to this four degrees across the sky 
we see the signal bigger than that the size of it so if people come around and say yes 
see the same signal we do and i see why they do that then they would say how is 
an inflationary if due to inflation it would be how something was just happened at the last minute just 
inflation turned off at this point where they have a lot of trouble with anyway call it graceful exit 
was one of the reasons i had trouble believing in it how you turned the blasted thing off uniformly 
the whole universe which seems a great problem and more of a problem now because not just uniform got 
little points where a huge amount of energy spewing out and waiting to see what the inflationary explanation will 
for these things sc but the good news talking about data now talking about observations other people can repeat 
analysis rp absolutely sc and see what comes out of that good and written a book about the conformal 
cosmology rp i did i wrote a book yes it i talked a little about the black hole collision 
nobody had seen them at that point i make any particular point about observation just that it potentially was 
sc i do want to plug the books this is a part of that chuckle sc an important part 
appearing your reward for appearing on the podcast rp oh yeah but cycles of time is the title sc 
of time excellent good rp yes sc available wherever books are available rp yes sc but not the only 
written been very happy to go and write books about all sorts of topics i think the people are 
wanna hear about quantum mechanics rp oh yeah sc if okay i think talked about quantum mechanics on the 
before certainly we will going forward the measurement problem rp absolutely yeah sc quantum mechanics has this weird feature 
there seems to be a thing that we need to include in the description that is what happens when 
look at something unlike any other theory ever in physics rp yes sc and so like many people been 
by the standard approaches to this problem so how do you like to think about it rp well i 
take the view that quantum mechanics is not finished i mean i like to quote authority but actually i 
chuckle because sc when right rp when right i mean einstein was he was doubtful about the theory being 
complete description of what goes on and schrodinger who put forward the equation which quantum theory is supposed to 
well he was troubled with it you can see because he put forward this ridiculous situation of the cat 
is the superposition of alive and dead as an example of the absurdity of following his own equation sc 
yeah rp so he was not saying this is what saying is an absurd thing we understand going sc 
that mean that right but if those people were worried then we have a license to be worried a 
bit at least rp right well dirac you have to find the right quote there because he express himself 
much but if you find the right place he was also just as skeptical sc i know that i 
about einstein and schrodinger rp yeah less well known but no he regarded quantum mechanics as a provisional theory 
it works very well but we need something better not sure how explicit he was about what it is 
him and maybe it was divergences as well but it was probably the measurement issue sc a wonderful book 
adam becker called what is real that just came out which makes the case that we tell ourselves this 
story about einstein and bohr where einstein just keep up chuckle sc and bohr got it right but in 
you know his arguments were better but he lost the pr battle back in the day rp yes it 
to be that yes well quite curious because in my view he was thinking along the right lines because 
was bringing in gravitational effects and bohr at this particular case who saw a way of resolving the issue 
favor of the conventional view but that was because they never really considered the effect of gravity on things 
was the effect in gravity and when you think of the effect of gravity where things change at least 
view and you can make i believe a good argument that there is a basic contradiction between the basic 
of both theories now when i say basic in gr general relativity this is the principle of equivalence that 
to say a gravitational field is like an acceleration so if you fall freely in a uniform field the 
field is gone as far as the physics is concerned rp and the principle in quantum mechanics which concerned 
here is the principle of superposition which as it says if you have an object which can be in 
place and if it can be in another place then there are perfectly good states where in both places 
once and you can see this with neutrons and things the way many things behave and when it comes 
cricket balls or baseballs not what you see and the question is why the difference and i curious i 
to lectures when i was in cambridge i was just working on pure mathematics but i went to lectures 
various things that interested me like cosmology and general relativity by bondi a course on mathematical logic by a 
called steen about theorem material machines and things and then was a lecture by dirac and it was his 
lecture where he talked about the superposition principle rp and he had a piece of chalk and he i 
he broke it in two as an image of where it could be in two places at once and 
talked about it and my mind wandered for a bit i know what i was thinking about and when 
came back to the subject moved on and i remember him say something about energy it quite sure what 
think just as well i hear his explanation because it might have calmed me down but instead worried about 
for ever since so how is it that big massive bodies appear in two places at once but then 
see if you look at the principle i have an example about this you think of an experiment done 
the table top which involves the gravitational field and you can see treat it two different ways either the 
of newtonian way which is the standard quantum mechanics procedure putting called a term in the hamiltonian worry about 
that means but what they do and the einsteinian way which we now know you pretend you take a 
falling frame and there a gravitational field rp and then you compare the answers you have a thing called 
wave function in each case and the two calculations are almost the same but if you look at them 
whether they differ by called the phase factor which you usually care about and so if you stuck to 
if you look at them carefully you see that this thing called the phase factor actually has a little 
thing with the time cubed in it which tells you that actually called the see when you do quantum 
theory you have a thing you have to do is you have to settle on what the vacuum is 
sc a vacuum is an interesting place in quantum field theory rp yes exactly and what you find is 
the vacuum is different in these two approaches now this is might not matter because you say stick to 
and fine but now think of a different situation where got an experiment where not the field you can 
about that because it sort of cancels out but the main point is that the einsteinian point of view 
you have a superposition if you look at what a little bug would feel near these superposed lumps got 
vacuum from one position and the other vacuum from the other and stuck because in standard quantum mechanics you 
these superpositions when different vacua so what i do is to sort of say well go through as best 
can and see if a kind of error that you could attribute not quite right but how far off 
sc and so sorry just to conceptualize this because the gravitational field of the thing is different that you 
of have a consistent quantum description of both fields at once rp yes when the lump is in two 
here and here then its gravitational if you take the einstein point of view of free fall which gets 
of the gravity and then you have a different vacuum so for each of these two locations you have 
different quantum field theory and that make any sense you go ahead with your standard procedures if got two 
quantum field theories for the two lump positions so in trouble so actually technically you are in trouble so 
i try to do is say how do you estimate the error or the uncertainty or whatever it and 
do a little calculation and you come to a measure of what this trouble is how big is it 
like an uncertainty in the energy of the system rp and then i say a bit like an unstable 
what you find is that for an unstable nucleus say there is an energy uncertainty which is inversely related 
its lifetime and this is standard physics and this inverse relationship is part of the heisenberg uncertainty relationship with 
have time energy uncertainty okay you sort of using it the other way round so people say if you 
the lifetime of the system what is the uncertainty in the energy now saying that you have an uncertainty 
the energy the lifetime what do i mean by lifetime well the sc yeah what do you mean by 
rp yes is that it decays into one location or the other sc now your proposal rp my proposal 
not rp i should say that there is a hungarian physicist called who had a very similar model before 
he have this particular motivation so it was or he has a suggestion that you might have for how 
superposed state might become one or the other by itself spontaneously the point is that not somebody coming and 
at it you sc nothing to do with observers rp right nothing to do with observers or if anything 
itself or something sc but do you think of this as a modification of conventional quantum mechanics or a 
of it not there in the textbooks right rp not in the textbooks i think a modification sc yeah 
rp going to need a theory i have a theory going to need a revolution you see i think 
it something like this gravitational theory survived a long time it worked beautifully and well people have started to 
things like the motion of mercury which quite agree with the theory and maybe there was a little extra 
called vulcan or maybe some other exploration or so on and then einstein explained it by not modifying theory 
putting another term in it or something by looking at it completely differently sc right so a partisan of 
quantum mechanics of many worlds wondered a little bit although i sat down and gone through the equations but 
everett we talk about wave functions branching because of decoherence because a system interacts with an environment and one 
a big challenge in quantum computing to prevent systems from acting and reacting with the environment so that you 
maintain quantum coherence but one thing you can never escape is gravity right so everything has a gravitational field 
in a superposition of two different places where the gravitational field would be different i can at least imagine 
there are virtual gravitons that are that in the particle physics language that in the classical language we would 
slightly different gravitational fields that could interact with the world and cause decoherence and maybe just because gravity is 
by massless particles sort of an inevitable branching of the wave function that leads to collapse in a way 
is at least morally similar to what talking about rp i think if you do take an everettian view 
to have something else like this to tell you what a world is in a sense because you want 
be able to say this world or that world and then you have to know what a world is 
so some quantum mechanical mess everything entangled with everything else or is it sort of singled out by having 
welldefined geometric spacetime structure in other words a welldefined gravitational field sc no i very much agree and people 
do foundations of quantum mechanics generally think too much about general relativity and spacetime or if they are experts 
it they think that the two problems are related but i do think that something people should take more 
rp yes well you see a lot of talk about quantum gravity people say we want to bring the 
subjects together these two great century fine but they usually concentrate on how quantum mechanics might affect spacetime structure 
gravity and this is where looking at things on a tiny scale of ten to the minus thirtythree cm 
ten to the minus fortythree seconds and things like that which are way off the range of experimental tests 
you might have to build an accelerator of the size of the solar system or something like that in 
to get the energies needed to explore this kind of level but this is much more optimistic this is 
effect of gravity on quantum mechanics not of quantum mechanics on gravity or you could call it gravitized quantum 
you see chuckle and here not bad at all just looking at experiments which are on the verge of 
done or being tried even now and other experiments coming up which could well give maybe direct evidence of 
rp one of the latest ideas is using boseeinstein condensates these are very very quantum mechanical states very very 
almost an absolute zero and you can play around with them in interesting ways and you could put them 
superpositions of two places at once maybe see what happens experimentally just about at the level that can be 
sc and gone further than that suggested it happens in our laughter rp yeah yes well sc for the 
we should mention that in part done this in collaboration with stuart hameroff who is in the room right 
chuckle sc you can say hi stuart rp yes hi stuart stuart hameroff hello everybody sc he is there 
which came first your consciousness thoughts as it were or your quantum mechanics thoughts or when did they get 
rp well you see the quantum mechanics thoughts came first but not that long before because i mentioned these 
courses i went to and the dirac issue about where there seems to be a gap in our present 
of he put it like that but that was what i felt but then i also went to this 
on mathematical logic and i had been struck had long conversations as an undergraduate with ian percival who we 
to discuss these things a lot and this issue of mathematical logic we had played around with logical systems 
formal logic and so on and then i had vaguely heard about theorem which seemed to tell us that 
are things in mathematics you prove and i like that idea chuckle rp so i went to the lecture 
which was very revealing first of all i learned about turing machines what modern computers are based on if 
like so i knew what the notion of computation was basically what a turing machine can do which is 
very beautiful mathematical idea and that there are certain things that are outside computation so i was aware of 
both the things that you can compute and things which are outside computation or beyond universal computation and then 
learned about the gödel theorem and it was not that things you see are true or false or something 
said that if you have any logical system say something the steps you could put them on a computer 
say they are computationally checkable rp so you have a line of argument which is meant to be a 
of some mathematical statement it could be like the last theorem that andrew wiles famously proved or it could 
the goldbach conjecture which nobody has proved yet if true or it could be simple statements like if you 
any two even numbers you get another even number so these are statements about an infinite number of things 
is rather a critical point and how do you prove things like that now is it according to following 
specific logical system rp well what gödel shows and turing had a much nicer way of doing it but 
gödel showed is that given your system of proof procedures and if you by understanding what the system does 
you trust the results that it says are if you test it on a theorem say is conjecture or 
is suggest a thing and if it comes out and says yes done then you believe it and you 
it because gone through all the proof procedures and the axioms involved and you still pick the first one 
say okay i trust that and the next one you say not ah yeah okay yes i see that 
so on until totally convinced that anything using those methods if it says you believe it rp then what 
does is he shows a statement which absolutely clearly constructed from this set of rules which is the statement 
the same kind about numbers and this statement you can see if you trust your systems prepared to use 
system to get truths then you must trust this as being true as well sc right rp so this 
is true on the basis of your same belief system as following the rules and things you come out 
so if you trust the system is giving you only truths then you must believe the statement yet at 
same time you demonstrate that not derivable by the rules now how the hell do we know true chuckle 
if you prove it eventually by the rules rp if you prove it that way sc that way yeah 
yet you can see true by means of the same understandings that you have that the procedures that accepting 
giving you proofs so i i was blown over by this when i saw it and i thought this 
as far as i can make out that our abilities to understand things are not a computation no matter 
it sc because we can see truths our you get the result that our minds are not going through 
proof procedure within some formal system rp right yes i mean you can add that thing to the other 
if you like and say my new proof but sort of cheating because that what you started with and 
did you know that other one was true when your things supposed to know are true are the things 
comes from some algorithm in your head and so what algorithm can that be if you can supercede it 
then i started thinking about i like to think some goodness knows what comes from the fairies or something 
gives us i think that our brains are constructed according to the same physical laws as everything else in 
world maybe something subtle about the way organized but then i thought well i suppose newtonian mechanics well you 
put it on a computer a little bit of an issue here because strictly speaking the laws that we 
are based on the continuum not discreetness sc right rp but the sort of feeling is that if you 
enough precision gonna get close enough that needs a bit more exploration but i think not going to argue 
that i think the fact that continuum as opposed to discreetness i think is a big point it was 
exploring that but not what i thought okay what about special relativity well still calculations like things what about 
these continuous things waves and so on well yeah same issue about their discreteness but not probably the real 
you could put it on a computer and what about general relativity again you could put it on the 
we have a really good demonstration of this now with the ligos and these sc you need to put 
on the computer now yeah rp absolutely i mean these calculations have come from really delicate understandings and calculations 
have produced the signals that you expect to see from blackhole encounters so we can certainly apply these procedures 
general relativity now what about quantum mechanics well you can evolve the schrodinger equation okay difficult you get all 
degrees of freedom which you have to keep track of and yeah but you could still put that on 
computer but then i remember piece of chalk you see and think well a gap and if what we 
upon when thinking and understanding things the main thing i concentrate on our understanding i would argue is something 
is not a computable process and the only place i could see where a relevant gap in our physical 
is in this measurement process or the collapse of the wave function yeah sc the collapse of the wave 
the random part of quantum mechanics rp the random part of quantum mechanics right so where we have a 
theory so the argument is that whatever is going on in our heads chuckle when producing conscious understandings conscious 
conscious whatever then involving this kind of gap in our understanding sc i mean this is probably too much 
ask in a brief period of time but so how do we go from the randomness to some kind 
understanding that goes beyond the merely algorithmic rp well the argument would be not really random sc oh okay 
it looks random but because the level at at quantum mechanics something deeper going on sc so a thumb 
the scale of the collapse of the wave function to give us some kind of insight into things that 
get rp yes as it you see the sort of opposite of some view that people have that the 
of the wave function takes place when some conscious observer sees it sc right rp so this is the 
of that not that our consciousness creates the collapse the collapse that creates our consciousness so the idea was 
i wrote this book new where i know much about neurobiology and so on and i thought well learn 
it and by the time i get to the end of the book see where a place that you 
have quantum coherence at the level needed i laughter rp i wrote the book and in the points i 
made up something at the end which i really believe in and sent the book out hoping that it 
maybe stimulate some young people to do physics or maths or something most of the letters i got were 
old retired people laughter rp but then i got one letter which was a little different from both of 
from our friend stuart here stuart hameroff told me i think you might find these structures more relevant to 
concerns than just neuron nerve which i thought have a hope in hell of preserving coherence it disturbs the 
and you get these electric fields and stuff which churn everything around and sure how do you keep that 
and so stuart in his letter described to me these little sc microtubules rp nano nano scale tubes and 
thought are i mean i get lots of crazy letters from people and is this another one laughter and 
said look pretty real in the so i checkup and see yeah just my ignorance was i know about 
and so stuart came over to oxford where i was at the time and we got together and tried 
make sense of what each other was talking about sc i mean one thing that is a lurking question 
i did have david chalmers on the podcast and we talked about the hard problem versus the easy problem 
consciousness rp yeah sc from everything you just said it sounds to me like what pointing at are what 
would call the easy problems of consciousness and admittedly no one thinks the easy problems are easy chuckle some 
think the hard problem is impossible some people think easy but everyone thinks the easy problems are hard do 
think that this way of thinking about quantum wave function collapse in the brain would help us understand the 
of experience the first person subjective view rp well you yeah i mean i had a short discussion with 
chalmers i think after a talk i had given it was only about ten seconds discussion but see he 
complaining i was saying basically the view that stuart and i have is that whenever one of these collapsed 
takes place where the state decides to be one or the other i mean i say you see sort 
it gets decided yes chuckle rp what is it you see but we that is always accompanied by a 
of protoconsciousness now you see protoconsciousness you think of that as the building blocks out of which consciousness is 
constructed it have any purpose at that level but the thing out of which consciousness is built now david 
like this he thought it was still not a solution of the hard problem well whether it is or 
just depends on your point of view but saying here is something which goes on in the physical world 
of which consciousness is and so a point of view that so you say a sort there are many 
element of experience every time these reductions take place but only protoconscious it relate it to anything else and 
any purpose it just does it sc and part of why here in southern california and i get to 
to you is because you have a new institute is that right the penrose institute and consciousness is gonna 
one of the things looking at rp that was certainly one of the big topics absolutely no i when 
was approached by james tagg originally he said mean the idea of it was a little bit scary and 
sure about but it seems to me here is an opportunity to explore things where the mainstream is going 
another direction and one of the obvious places is with the consciousness issue and stuart and a few people 
this point of view seriously and here is a way of looking at it not the mainstream but a 
way of looking at the problem which does have a chance it seems to me of yielding some real 
into what consciousness is sc so just tell us a little bit about the penrose institute in san diego 
that right rp well not anywhere sc a state of mind right now rp sort of spread out in 
places but san diego is well that was the place it was initially supposed to be maybe it is 
really based anywhere at the moment kind more of a concept rather than having a clear location which you 
in quantum mechanics you can have things like chuckle sc perfectly compatible yes exactly so the mission statement of 
institute rp well see i more or less made it up but i remember it at the moment chuckle 
but the idea is to explore ideas which are not mainstream but they have to be things where they 
experimentally testable i wanted to make sure about that sc not a philosophy institute rp well right and in 
of people who might say flaky this is just some ideas who but the idea is they have to 
things where you could they be immediately testable but pretty soon got to be really within the range of 
and but initially these were on the consciousness thing or maybe things to what creativity is or something but 
thought most of my works on physics i really i know much biology so not really my main interest 
so i thought we need a strong side on the physics side but which is exploring these things which 
a little offbeat in the sense of not too many people do it so things like the collapse of 
wave function which is an important one and i asked ivette fuentes who is somebody i knew who she 
on unconventional approaches to gravitational wave detection and what i knew about rp so you use boseeinstein condensates which 
completely on a different scale from ligo but it struck me that a lot of promise in that idea 
these boseeinstein condensates are the most quantum mechanical thing you can think of more or less and practically absolute 
so looking at things which can be really isolated from disturbance from the outside and i had long discussions 
her also about how you might use these things for the collapse of the wave function so this is 
the major project being done in nottingham in england at the moment because where her post she was in 
originally when i was getting her interested in this and she has a team of people working in nottingham 
one of the the main project really concerned with is looking at these boseeinstein condensates and whether you can 
whether the collapse of the wave function takes place in a measurable way and which is objective not something 
depends on somebody looking at it really the system itself does this or that in a time scale which 
consistent with the sort of proposal that i was putting forward sc well you know as a scientist always 
to be correct to say things that are true but which you certainly have done but also something to 
said when able to inspire and provoke people into doing interesting things and looking into things in slightly new 
rp very much the case yes and the hope is of course yes to get other people who might 
interested in exploring some of these ideas and taking them seriously sc and gotten a lot of things named 
you along the way which is pretty good too chuckle rp there are a few of those yes chuckle 
alright roger penrose been a great pleasure thanks so much for being on the podcast rp thank you great 
music a list ausgezeichnet i wish this conversation never ended i hate time pingback sean carroll podcast episode roger 
on spacetime consciousness and the universe the penrose institute wow sean carrol and sir roger penrose what else could 
ask for two of the brightest minds in cosmology and general relitivaty phenomenal guys sean carroll and roger penrose 
conversation i know how you do it sean mindscape was already the best podcast on the web and you 
keep making it better brandon may asks else could you ask how about a conversation with david mermin he

philosophical society award making better sense of quantum mechanics arxiv to appear in reports on progress in physics even 
i knew some of those achievements in isolation i never realized until last week that all those achievement came 
a single person namely david mermin and he has written more books than listed above books i never heard 
before look for the date yourself if you are interested all the way through communicating science in a prosaic 
rhymes with pork and other scientific about time understanding and time in special thank you absolutely illuminating what an 
man thanks sean this podcast made for the most enjoyable commute home had in a good long while thank
