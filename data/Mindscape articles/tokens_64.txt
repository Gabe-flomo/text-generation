mindscape podcast your host sean carroll sc in episode gonna tackle a perennial big question in the natural sciences 
to understand the sense in which the world is complicated now i mean this in a very particular way 
way the world could be which is completely chaotic right like things just happening at random no order or 
anywhere another way the world could be which is completely rigid and orderly right sc the actual world is 
in between these two things sort of poles of chaos and order and we balance ourselves in between one 
but the other is no one planned it right not a central designer that says this is how things 
be the universe somehow organizes itself and when i say the universe especially of course here on earth in 
biosphere so guest is actually a mathematician steven strogatz has become very well known for his popular books on 
but equally successful as a researcher as i mentioned in the podcast the author of a paper that has 
over citations which makes regular physicists like me very jealous and one of the founders of both the field 
studying synchronization spontaneous synchronization of different physical systems and then out of that study came the study of networks 
a particular small world networks the way that many systems like the human brain or the internet are organized 
it is neither just you talk to your nearest neighbors nor you talk to everybody but again somewhere in 
how does this sort of mixture of chaos and order naturally come about through the working out of math 
its equations sc so a wonderful communicator and a real pioneer in this field so i think gonna enjoy 
conversation go music sc steven strogatz welcome to the mindscape podcast steven strogatz thanks very much sean sc you 
very well known as a popularizer of math but also extremely well known as a doer of math i 
to think of the math you do as almost kind of physics not the pure math that is proving 
things really hands dirty there in the real world how did you come to think of yourself as an 
mathematician not something that most people grow up wanting to be ss a good point and i even know 
existed when i was in college i thought i wanted to be a math major and they had a 
kid winning our algebra class for the people who had done very well in math in high school so 
found myself in there and i got crushed in my first semester of college i got the worst grade 
i ever got in college in that course and it was the kind of course that is supposed to 
like to weed out the people who have the right stuff to be a pure mathematician they were trying 
decide gonna be the mathematician of the future and otherwise a lot of kids in high school think pretty 
in math and the idea was correct them very early on i have to say to this day i 
resent that course because they put a really quite weak teacher in there and so it was a real 
or swim experience for all of us and i definitely was taking in a lot of water sc this 
be a big deviation from the planning of the podcast but okay actually that my best podcasts have involved 
from the plan but let me just remark that we live in a culture in physics and in math 
this weed them out sink or swim ask them to do impossible things and see who suffers the least 
i personally think that that is not really the way to make the best scientists or mathematicians ss me 
of course i agree with you as a weed or a wouldbe weed almost weeded out i think we 
a lot of talent with that kind of approach and no need to be that discouraging so yeah i 
kinda wanna go along on this thread sc yeah do it ss because i think something a lot of 
have experienced this feeling of having once loved some subject and then getting discouraged in college and not necessarily 
bad thing as long as it turns out okay you go in some other direction so in my case 
thought well maybe really meant to do physics and so to respond to your earlier question i took a 
of physics too which was always a great interest of mine sc i love the idea that physics is 
you went after being weeded out that is not how physicists think of themselves laughter ss no come on 
saying that i just thought math was my thing because i feel like i certainly i was a disaster 
the lab i knew that already from high school and i felt like i my physical intuition never seemed 
great i know especially like freebody diagrams things pushing even action and reaction i always found that very mysterious 
well it is feel bad ss yeah but the math part of it when once it was converted to 
then i felt very secure so i thought that was my natural strength but then i started to think 
after this one very prooforiented course and i had never really had any experience with trying to do rigorous 
proofs at that point in my life so anyway i enjoyed the physics course especially enjoyed oh sorry it 
the spring semester of my freshman year we took a we i think these other kids that were in 
same cohort out of the electricity and magnetism book by purcell sc right ss i know that you would 
that book and maybe some of your listeners will know that book one of the most beautifully written textbooks 
any subject i would say i think do you agree with that sc yeah no we use it when 
was undergraduate but i know it since then very very good ss what was so interesting to me about 
was that it just tell you for instance that the force between two charges is gonna be along the 
between the charges suppose the electrostatic forces how much does a proton pull on an electron gonna be some 
and in high school i had learned this thing law that the force would go along that line between 
but what was so interesting to me and purcell is that he said that follows from the symmetry of 
ss but not just a property of this force a property about space because if you imagine those two 
by themselves in an empty universe otherwise empty there would be assuming that space is the same in all 
there is no other preferred direction than this line between them so it has to be along that line 
whether you believe that argument or not i just was entranced by the idea that you could make an 
like that sc yeah you can see how this would light up the mathematician inside you laughter ss so 
taken a big long detour from your original question but the point was that i always liked math but 
did like the math of the real world or at least the sort of semireal world that we study 
classes like physics class not the real real world where i had to catch my clothes on fire or 
sparks in the lab or something sc i studied cosmology and quantum mechanics so i make any claims to 
too involved with the real real world but applied maths is an interesting field right i guess pure math 
the alternative really about proofs right some math things gonna prove some things also math which is this wonderful 
field where we say things we think are true and we give some arguments for them but we actually 
things and i think applied math i have the feeling is somehow in between those poles ss well it 
many different things to many different people so some see applied math just to be clear since we really 
about these things there are these two roughly speaking two flavors of math so math that looks inward at 
which is what i think of as pure math and math that looks outward at the world at the 
very broadly construed it could be oceanography it could be the universe it could be biology whatever but a 
in the service of something else or sometimes math inspired by something else like something beautiful that happens in 
can be then the beginning of a new mathematical theory and some people would still call that pure math 
i would think of that as part of applied math or maybe close to what you just called the 
sc do you actually in your daily in your work in your papers are you typically proving a theorem 
i noticed that one of the wonderful things about your work is that very often you sort of figure 
what the answer to the question is by doing some computer simulations ss true yeah a noholdsbarred style definitely 
called a physicist by many of my mathematician friends that they see me as using the spirit of physics 
i do from the physics culture that i absorbed i learned that that you should try lots of different 
you can guess you can use intuition you can use physical reasoning you can use computers you could do 
kinds of sometimes a proof is great if you can do a proof but not the only game in 
whereas in pure math that is the endall and beall is to prove theorems i never never no so 
not one of those for me all kinds of ways of getting evidence and trying to understand true definitely 
in the truth about the equations or the mathematical models that i study but i sort of actually feel 
lot of affinity with artists i must say ss this could take us in an interesting direction you from 
of your writing although we never met i get the feeling resonate with this but really interested in something 
you maybe you could call like mathematical impressionism that is instead of making a photorealistic painting of the world 
the mathematical equivalent i like to get inspired by something in nature or in the world and then do 
much simpler the essence of out there sort of like the way the impressionist painters try to capture the 
they interested in that they were trying to with their either their dots or their bold strokes convey the 
of whatever that was and so i like my models to be for instance there was one paper that 
did with my colleague rennie mirollo a mathematician at boston college where we were thinking about a certain problem 
it reminded us of fireflies that all flash in sync all flashing on and off together and yeah what 
did was not an accurate model of real fireflies i would never claim that and we were careful in 
discussion at the end of the paper to explain why fireflies were quite different from what we were pretending 
this paper yet they were somehow like the essence of what the fireflies were doing sc yeah to a 
that just makes perfect sense obviously math involved but the idea of distilling down some complicated thing to the 
possible description that captures something vital about it is what we do for a living in our own minds 
so always liked that attitude in physics and i do feel it has a lot in common with an 
impulse sc yeah ss just be clear not like this is something that everyone would agree with there are 
a few applied mathematicians who say not good enough you should really try to make a model that is 
and the ultimate arbiter is reality like if your model do the right things in experiments or match observations 
qualitatively then gone too far then lost the ss i sort of believe that i agree that if gone 
far of course you have lost the essence but the truth is if really being honest about it i 
more about math than nature okay a big dirty thing to say sc no go ahead in a math 
okay ss well right and why not a physicist because i think a physicist ultimately does care about getting 
science right and this evil part of me that says beautiful but a little bit wrong okay with sc 
beautiful yeah laughter sc the difference between a fine artist and a photo journalist absolutely right or an illustrator 
well maybe so an old quote from the sc trying to make this a flattering comparison from your perspective 
illustrator the fine artist ss well just a matter of what people are interested in so i think as 
as honest about what trying to do then i think it should be okay just where you pretend that 
is realistic and not then gonna get in trouble sc and the example you used is perfect because i 
to segue into this whole question of to an example of what been working on through your whole life 
suppose i guess as an applied mathematician themes come back and forth rather than just working on one big 
for your whole life but the fireflies are the example that you used in your book sync to introduce 
reader to this wonderful thing that appears all over nature in very different forms where you had independent agents 
something and yet they naturally fall into synchronization was that firefly paper that you alluded to there the first 
of when you thought about that phenomenon ss certainly one of our very earliest i say our because again 
person i mentioned earlier rennie mirollo i did a lot of this work with him he was and still 
probably my best friend and we did a lot of this when we were just starting our career so 
was a postdoc he was a new assistant professor but anyway yeah it was very early that was in 
early and to me part of a larger theme a cosmic theme about order emerging out of disorder i 
found that spooky almost theological because in physics in the simplest case like say in thermodynamics classes we learn 
things tend to disorder if you have a closed system with no energy coming in or getting out sc 
do ss and then the second law tells us that gonna just come to equilibrium and be disordered sort 
maximally as in the jargon the entropy will keep increasing but yeah we see fantastically organized structures all around 
we see civilization we see biology organizing itself into ecosystems and living things cells this fantastic fight between the 
that want not want but make the universe tend to greater disorder and yet we see all kinds of 
looks like spontaneous order all around us so still somewhat mysterious from a physics perspective although not to say 
the second law not possible a correct law more or less we could talk about that but not go 
sc no actually this is one of my pet peeves you have not said any of my pet peeve 
a pet peeve i have about how people talk about the second law where they say what everyone says 
is that in a closed system you tend to disorder and then they stop and then they say but 
at these open systems you get order but they help but telling themselves the order appears in this open 
despite the second law ss yeah no no no despite sc yeah exactly there is no despite like saying 
moon orbits the earth despite the force of gravity because you think that gravity pulls things together and the 
fall so obviously despite the force of gravity so i just react against that now you do it not 
of it but i think that a lot of work yet to be ss exactly sc in figuring out 
open systems do organize themselves and how entropy is actually part of the reason why that happens not something 
opposed by it ss right exactly sure on the same page with that the challenge of nonequilibrium thermodynamics that 
has to somehow be consistent with what we already know to be true from equilibrium or close to equilibrium 
and yet the math and the conceptualization the physics part of it just very difficult and some of the 
exciting research going on right now in nonequilibrium statistical physics so sc and apparently fireflies are an example of 
ss no i approach it from a physics perspective because first of all i never took stat mech statistical 
i never went that far in physics so i really know what talking about here but i did work 
it from the perspective of someone interested in differential equations which allow us to describe systems that change in 
or in space or both and so something like fireflies you can make a little abstract version of them 
you think of well going on with the firefly if you have a single firefly that keeping alive in 
jar that captured out in your backyard then it will flash and then its flash has stopped and then 
of dark for a while and then it somehow is building up its readiness to flash until it reaches 
we know really going on but probably something happening in its nervous system where got a little timer some 
circuit i think literally not known exactly how the flash rhythm works sc yeah interesting i was gonna ask 
really i know obviously but still not even know do you think ss well we know something about the 
of what the substance is that sort of ignites and flashes we know about the enzymes that degrade it 
i loosely speaking a bit analogous to something we all learn in the first year of physics where a 
between two on capacitor plates building up like in the jargon an rc circuit or a relaxation oscillator something 
building up toward a threshold and when it reaches that threshold then you get a sudden discharge which in 
case would be the firefly flashing or in the case of the rc circuit would be the capacitor dumping 
charge and then starting to build up again as it charges up so we rennie mirollo and i made 
little model of effectively lots of little relaxation oscillators building up discharging and every time somebody discharges it kicks 
else up a little bit closer to their firing threshold or sc they get excited or something like that 
yeah right and that part we know is correct qualitatively that fireflies not only flash but they see the 
of others and adjust the timing of their flash rhythm in response to the flash of others we know 
from experiments where you can use a pen flashlight to be like an artificial firefly and if you periodically 
your flashing flashlight at this for instance you can play tricks on it you could flash a little faster 
its normal rhythm and then see that firefly sort of scurrying to keep up not literally moving its feet 
it flashes a little bit faster to stay in sync with your abnormally fast flashlight up to limits if 
drive it more than like faster than it wants to go it keep up and then it falls out 
sync sc this is not helping the reputation of mad scientists and statistic experimenters on the animal kingdom afraid 
they do a lot of worse things than this laughter ss well anyway so we do know that there 
interaction rules that can be measured through the kind of experiments i just measured and so the hypothesis was 
that happening in a congregation of fireflies is all both flashing and receiving flashes from others and adjusting in 
with some rules and so then the big math problem and something that transcends biology not trained to solve 
question like this if every firefly is individually obeying the rules that you can measure then is it the 
that synchrony will emerge automatically every time in such a population and that turns out to be quite a 
math problem because of the discontinuities in it ss i said when a flash first of all the flash 
like a sudden impulse just a quick on and then quick off and then also we imagine that to 
that capacitor analogy that the discharge is very fast so the firefly sort of so to speak instantly goes 
to its baseline before it starts charging up again and so when you have jumps in any kind of 
that trying to describe with math unfortunately the apparatus that we use in math assumes everything is smooth and 
and jump around discontinuously so it sc when you say the apparatus these are all human constructions right like 
math used to doing is comfortable with this so this is why you get paid the big bucks to 
of generalize that way of thinking a little bit ss yeah thank you i mean apparatus in a laboratory 
meant the mental tools that we use specifically avoiding using the word calculus but really what i wanna say 
calculus is predicated on the idea that things can change but they only change smoothly they jump discontinuously from 
place to another whereas these fireflies sort of act like they do at least with these sudden flashes and 
sudden response to flashes and so what made the problem hard and why it was a research problem for 
was that how do you accommodate something that is on the one hand continuously charging up towards its threshold 
then at the same time it can suddenly flash and suddenly discharge and go back so it was this 
of continuity and discontinuity that made the math abnormal and weird and challenging sc and this is all started 
in a very scientific way in the sense that we saw the fireflies doing this this had been known 
a long time the fireflies got into sync somehow and i guess as a human being your first guess 
that well a boss firefly a clear leader that is telling them what to do a conductor for the 
but that seem to pan out empirically so your question was could it be selforganizing this coming into synchronization 
yes exactly right right i did get a little ahead of myself there with talking about the math it 
a great story that people that lived in thailand or malaysia had known about this seen it forever but 
first westerners to come to those parts of the world like sir francis drake from england in the there 
ships logs that we can read of his sailors saying as we go down these rivers like the river 
thailand there are these strange creatures that live in the mangrove trees that flash and they call them lightning 
sc what i called them growing up in philadelphia so still lightning bugs ss exactly so yeah lightning bugs 
whatever you wanna call them but what was spectacular is that there would be tree after tree for miles 
the river bank filled with these fireflies thousands of them it seemed and like you could visualize it almost 
a christmas tree with christmas lights on it except that these are beetles that we think these little beetles 
have this strange flashing property and the whole tree will ignite and get dark simultaneously and it goes on 
night long and just an amazing spectacle ss but the question was as you said how is it possible 
are not the most ingenious creatures just little bugs and at the beginning of the night not doing that 
they fly into the trees as the sun goes down totally disorganized if you get there at dusk you 
the phenomenon it builds up over the night and it takes a while but by the middle of the 
perfectly organized so that was always the question is it that as you say is there some kind of 
firefly like a conductor for the orchestra and all following the lead of that one not gonna be a 
robust biological way of doing it if a bird eats that particular maestro you know what then not gonna 
that night sc so also who appoints the head firefly that seem biologically sensible ss on the other hand 
have to keep in mind that there are things in biology organized like that like there is a queen 
who is different from the other bees so not unthinkable that there is a king firefly but no one 
found one and so the prevailing view today is that done this spontaneous synchronization is an emergent phenomenon that 
you say it selforganizes you need an external signal like lightning in the jungle you those were the old 
that there look in the tropics gonna always be some lightning storms and all the fireflies get startled by 
lightning flash and that kind of presynchronizes them all as they respond in shock to that lightning bolt but 
because it happens every night even if not raining ss anyway but they were like i say it was 
very old problem and it was only by around the that those experiments that i mentioned with pen flashlights 
that the fireflies are both reacting to flashes as well as emitting them and the conjecture was always that 
somehow through that process of interaction come in to sync but no biologist could figure out how to demonstrate 
because they have the computers that could not the way that they think they have different training so you 
need a physicist or a mathematician to try to work on this sc and the mechanism is just that 
fireflies are looking at each other and somehow what they see is affecting their rate of firing ss right 
so yeah if they see a flash when they were not expecting to see one it might tell them 
a little bit and then not consciously but through just some unconscious processes in their nervous system we think 
them as having much consciousness they just automatically adjust their timing something in their nervous system changes in response 
seeing this flash such that on the next time they will be more nearly in sync with that flash 
and not an especially complicated form of order especially sophisticated but still selforganizing in the sense that no teleology 
no goal there was no idea that gonna get together and do this just doing their own individual thing 
suddenly or not so suddenly but yeah ultimately all doing the same thing i saw you do the same 
at a ted talk where you ask everyone to clap in the audience and very quickly all clapping in 
ss yeah an interesting comparison there the audience knows trying to get in sync but yeah right that the 
have any particular goal and there are different theories about why doing it i should clarify only the male 
that are doing this sc ah i know that sc so definitely something going on with mating not just 
fireflies the females are flying around and looking for males to mate with and it seems well so this 
where the biologists quite figured out what they wanna say they used to say the idea was that all 
fireflies of a certain species would get in sync because it would send their message the farthest possible distance 
would make a very bright signal that could escape the darkness of the jungle you could sort the females 
find them from far away be this beacon like where all the boys are but still from a darwinian 
how is it to my advantage if i look just like my neighbor maybe come sc do the females 
at all ss they will flash yeah sometimes they will flash they actually do a little dance of light 
they flash and then if the male is flashing in the right way that is they wanna mate with 
of the right species because if you go with the wrong species you could get eaten sc yeah okay 
ss but they do they send signals to each other and if the flashing is done in a way 
they find attractive or from someone of their species then actually be drawn toward it so yeah the females 
flashing too a lot of signaling to find each other and make sure on the same page sc and 
mathematical result was it that this kind of spontaneous ordering by a synchronization is inevitable or it happens under 
right circumstances is it rare and fragile or generic or what ss well so yeah the particular model that 
made was the simplest possible thing where we imagine every firefly could see every other firefly and that really 
really they would mostly see the ones that are near them in a tree and they be paying very 
attention to one a mile down the river but we ignored that so we did what in physics would 
called the infinite range approximation where every firefly is imagined to be able to interact with everyone else out 
infinite distance away from them the reason for doing that is that when studying something that consists of a 
interacting sort of complicated for the reasons i said with this rc circuit analogy ss so if trying to 
the collective behavior of a million of these little tricky things you wanna have the additional complication of who 
is talking to who because we even know how to solve the simpler problem so yeah in the case 
we did with everyone interacting with everyone we proved actually this is one of the few times we did 
really prove a theorem we proved that for this model they would always synchronize in the sense not that 
a possibility of something else happening just that there was zero chance of it happening so in the jargon 
this if what i wanna say is it had probability zero not the so a good analogy for this 
i know for a physicist gonna happen a mathematician trying to be more careful bother gonna happen ss yeah 
probability mean that there possibilities of it happening just that never see them in practice to give a loose 
if i throw a pencil in the air there is some possibility it could land on its point and 
that is possible it never gonna see that sc right possible that the popular vote for president would be 
a tie right these things could happen but your mathematical notion of measure zero is even less than that 
is just not very likely ss the idea sc the fireflies are gonna come in to synchronization that was 
great triumph and but one of the wonderful things and one of the wonderful things consistently about good math 
that it finds application all over the place in the brain and how we sleep and things like that 
notions come to rise right ss true there are so many different examples of spontaneous synchronization that are important 
science and in medicine and nature like you mentioned in the brain so a lot of neuroscientists will tell 
that synchronous oscillation of neurons in the brain is related to phenomena like attention and memory you can sort 
see sometimes when if looking under an fmri machine people call them brain scans or talk about what part 
the brain lights up when doing a certain task or whatever very often the way the brain will sort 
get okay so an example suppose looking at an apple and i can recognize that an apple you might 
kind of obvious of course you can recognize it but not everyone can there are people with brain damage 
recognize simple objects anymore so actually a miraculous thing happening in our brains when we see an apple on 
table and recognize it as an apple and not something else ss think about involved you have specialized neurons 
detect color there are others that are looking at shape there are some that are thinking about other qualities 
the apple and we somehow put all those different qualities together to recognize one whole coherent object the apple 
what you observe in the brain when happening is that the parts of the brain that are noticing color 
actually firing electrically at the same frequency as the parts that are noticing shape or whatever so synchronous oscillation 
the way of the biologists call it the binding problem how do you bind all the different features of 
object into a coherent single object to recognize that not just a bunch of different things happening in your 
all at once sc interesting so not just that a part of my brain saying seeing something red and 
part saying seeing something appleshaped but saying it in synchrony with each other and somehow that lets the brain 
conscious perception say that is an apple ss yeah and it says that right exactly those separate things that 
all oscillating in sync are meanwhile other parts of the brain that are not paying attention or that are 
about or interested in other aspects out of sync and so ignored the way of telling itself all part 
one object or one sensation and this go ahead sc i was just gonna say be very honest and 
that i actually read this chapter of your book i just remembered the chapter titles so i wanted to 
you about it but does this imply that a separate part of the brain that is keeping track of 
frequency of oscillations to say oh yes this is a coherent thing ss an interesting question yeah it might 
i think the thalamus is often regarded as a relay station that it takes in signals from different parts 
the brain and it might do some of the binding of happening elsewhere not positive got that right so 
of your listeners may correct you sc well asking that they correct me the neuroscientist and the physicist so 
to say that not an expert ss that part not sure but i am pretty confident that if you 
most brain researchers now tell you the binding problem is solved by synchronization or at least their best current 
now i should say you always want things in sync in your brain epilepsy is a famous disease you 
picture someone having those during a seizure the most famous symptom is these rhythmic convulsions and the rhythmic twitching 
convulsions is that many millions or billions of neurons are discharging in perfect step when not supposed to sc 
that i did know about a problem this is always one of the problems with organization that you want 
right amount of it ss yeah exactly so yeah you can have pathological synchrony too sc and where does 
come into this i literally just yesterday was having a conversation with a bunch of scientists in different areas 
why do we sleep and the answer is often well this chemical that puts us to sleep but the 
level question what is the purpose of falling asleep is this kind of research relevant there ss it could 
that question wow that takes me back my phd was about sleep research i worked on human sleep and 
rhythms those rhythms that we have in hormone fluctuations and body temperature and lots of other internal rhythms but 
has ever really believe it or not figured out why we need to sleep it might sound ridiculous like 
mother when i was a kid she actually she had a theory she said because you have too much 
gas laughter ss and like what sc a very mechanistic theory i like it ss yeah she said when 
the longer awake the more sleepy gas you build up and then eventually when you get so much of 
then you have to go to sleep and then it goes away so she was actually doing the rc 
model that i talked about earlier where something builds up to a threshold and then she imagined it gets 
and chewed up when asleep but actually that so far off from one of the leading theories of going 
is that there are sleep substances that are measurable there are peptides that can be detected for instance a 
experiment from a long long time ago maybe about on the order of one hundred years ago where researchers 
sheep the animal the farmyard animal you keep a sheep awake how would you do that you could probably 
bothering it and disturbing it and poking it i know so they did something to keep the poor sheep 
for way past its bedtime so it was sc let it read twitter be enough laughter ss yeah you 
anyway you could do sleep deprivation on an animal and then the experiment was take a little bit of 
blood of that animal that is sleepdeprived and inject it into another sheep and that other sheep falls asleep 
away sc okay so that certainly seems to imply to my scientific mind that there is a chemical tracer 
the blood saying you should go to ss yeah and over the years isolated candidates for that for a 
time it was thought to be something called muramyl peptide that was the alleged sleep substance i think others 
been found since then so possible that one of the things happening that just being awake and active produces 
byproducts of activity that give you the subjective sensation of feeling tired and that that is you need to 
yourself back to having less of that stuff so sleep is partly for that but it seems a lot 
going on with sleep there are ecological reasons to sleep depends on if a predator or prey if prey 
wanna be in your burrow especially when not favorable for you like an animal that wants to be out 
the daytime then you better be hiding when night time when all those nocturnal animals are looking for food 
you can see how synchronization gets involved with all of these different things certainly about to fly to europe 
i know that jet lag is something that hits me very hard and apparently in part because different circadian 
inside your body get out of sync with each other ss right exactly that is what jet lag is 
funny thing a lot of people get confused about it and heard so many people say i get jet 
i just stay up all night and then i sleep it off the next day and then but what 
noticing is that jet lag just is not only about sleep and sleep disruption there are all these other 
that not so aware of that are inside of us if you think about it aware of when do 
wanna go to the bathroom sc yeah ss when do you feel hungriest when are you most alert those 
internal rhythms and then there are others that like i say body temperature is going up and down even 
you lie still in bed and people have done experiments like this just keep someone awake in bed all 
long you can measure their temperature and going up and down like a nice sine wave so there are 
rhythms of temperature of alertness what happens during jet lag is that even if your sleep gets on to 
local time your internal rhythms are still back at home time the lag in jet lag sc yeah every 
person has a lot of things going on inside them that can be in or out of synchronization it 
does matter ss right right and so there are things in the outside world that help to resynchronize us 
important is sunlight but food is another one the timing of your meals will affect and melatonin of course 
have heard now of this brain hormone melatonin that you can use as a pill for a sleeping pill 
for a circadian rhythm restoration pill but i have to say always been skeptical of melatonin not having used 
so maybe those people out there who are listening and do use it and swear by it not saying 
it but i can tell you that in experiments picograms of melatonin are enough to be biologically active that 
a one like twelve zeros ss a picogram is a tiny tiny tiny amount chuckle of melatonin has a 
action so i imagine how much is in a pill i think like a trillion times more than your 
wants so i feel like taking such an ungodly amount of i would be scared to do it but 
hear of anyone having trouble with it so probably wrong sc confess i think melatonin is a miracle drug 
me it could be entirely psychosomatic i take sleeping pills and i generally have no trouble sleeping and even 
i take nyquil i wake up feeling groggy and i just want to do that but when i travel 
i wanna get to sleep something like a local bedtime i take melatonin it puts me out and i 
no aftereffects the next day ss well i gotta start doing it this is a case where too much 
a theorist laughter sc yeah well chuckle it could be killing me longterm i know laughter ss hope not 
yeah hope not okay raised this issue and i really wanted to leap in at the time but i 
we had other things to talk about so i you raised this issue with the fireflies of the approximation 
every firefly is seeing every other firefly now obviously not true but maybe a good enough approximation to get 
on in something like the brain even obviously less true and kind of super important that not true right 
neuron is not talking to every other neuron and i think correct me if wrong that this kind of 
led you to think about the phenomenon of networks and how things were connected which eventually resulted in a 
that has so many citations that my jealousy is overwhelming laughter ss well right it was a desire to 
away from that very unrealistic infinite range approximation and to just start paying attention to whatever new phenomena would 
if we tried to be a bit more realistic about the networks that really do occur in so many 
phenomena that got us thinking about what came to be called smallworld networks the phrase smallworld is supposed to 
you think of that experience that we all have when we get on a plane or go to a 
party and you meet somebody and you start talking and then you realize yeah my cousin went to that 
chuckle so then people say a small because it seems like how is that possible how can we be 
also the counterpart the other phrase that you hear all the time is six degrees of separation sc yeah 
that i know someone who knows someone and we can connect ourselves to anybody it seems through just a 
small number of mutual acquaintances or chain of acquaintances which then became a popular game right that kevin bacon 
with actors sc mention that this morning jennifer my wife a science journalist said you know a guy named 
and of course yes cause a professor at caltech but also i realized he i think is the nephew 
one of your collaborators or mentors in the synchronization game right ss actually the son sc the son okay 
yeah art son and art winfree was my closest mentor of my career sc a small world laughter ss 
a small world when i went to work with art winfree at that time he had a twelve or 
erik who has gone on to be a great scientist and is your colleague at caltech but who also 
about the two of them is that one of the few father and son double macarthur award winners they 
got macarthur prizes sc something to tell your dad i got my own macarthur now yeah laughter ss so 
geniuses in the family and erik was a very smart little boy not surprised turned out to be a 
smart professor too sc and actually not surprising all academics and scientists and so forth but if you did 
very simple view of the world where everyone knew who ever lived within five miles of them and nobody 
then it would take a huge number of steps of separation for me to get from someone in another 
and the smallworld network phenomena says really just not like that at ss yeah right so counterintuitive because we 
have this strong sensation that i only know the people that live near me geographically or that are in 
department at work or go to my church or whatever it is so we feel like we move in 
circles and so why we are always so surprised and say wow weird a small and yet if we 
statistically minded we should be thinking smallworld thing keeps happening to me it must not be that laughter because 
experiences it so there must be some explanation ss and one of the things that duncan watts who was 
grad student at the time was interested in his father had said to him you know that only six 
from the president that you could find you may not have ever met say in this case donald trump 
you might know someone who knows someone and within six handshakes know someone who knows sc yeah ss that 
duncan as an interesting thing because at the time he was trying to study not fireflies but crickets there 
crickets that can chirp in unison the analog of the fireflies flashing in unison so the biologists speak of 
of crickets that are all chirping at the same time and we have this particular species of those crickets 
tree crickets as called that live in ithaca and so we thought we could do experiments on these crickets 
see if some of the mathematical models of synchronization actually predict what the crickets are really doing that would 
new because the case of the fireflies in thailand much harder to go all the way to thailand and 
them but the crickets are right here in the orchards in ithaca new york where i teach at cornell 
so we have like the grandmaster of sonic synchronization right here chuckle the snowy tree crickets so we thought 
would make a nice experiment for duncan to do for a project for his phd work so he learned 
to capture the crickets and keep them alive and we were starting to put them in little soundproof boxes 
that we could control how strongly they could hear each other and try to set up an experiment with 
help of a bioacoustics expert named tim forrest ss anyway it was in the course of doing these cricket 
that duncan started to think about i wonder when the crickets are out there in the orchard actually listening 
who do they all hear each other that be right maybe they only hear the ones right next to 
and so he got to thinking about connectivity in general and then through a brainstorm he remembered this thing 
dad had said about six handshakes from the president and so he came into my office one day and 
if things were connected in this smallworld or six degrees of separation way would they synchronize better than if 
were just connected to their neighbors or would how would it and i thought i know i mean laughter 
even know how you do this six degrees thing ss and so we realized a whole big math problem 
explains this small world and not only that but how would it affect synchronization and duncan said much bigger 
it because anything connected like that think it would make a big difference because everyone is so close to 
in the sense of the small world just a few hops away from everyone else so like how would 
affect diseases spreading sc yeah ss at the time actually people were talking about hiv a lot it get 
as much any more but during the height of the aids epidemic you would hear people say if you 
with someone not just sleeping with them sleeping with everyone that they slept with and everyone that that person 
with so the idea was out there that you feel like only interacting with a lowrisk group but actually 
a few steps away from the virus say sc i think i would like to try explaining these two 
that you talk about in the book that are relevant to characterizing these networks the idea of the shortest 
between two people in the network and the separate idea of the clustering right like how many people are 
to overlapping friends is that something willing to try to put in unassailable terms ss sure totally yeah not 
hard the idea of path length is just the idea that we were talking about with six degrees that 
say you and i never actually shaken hands so we met and i actually know what our shortest path 
but we could start naming physicists and mathematicians that met okay gonna guess guessing shaken brian hand sc i 
been a previous podcast guest chuckle ss okay and i know brian greene because known him since he was 
high school student so that would and i think any faster route one handshake for me to brian and 
handshake from him to you so two degrees of separation apart and our shortest possible path our path length 
path length is just the shortest route from one node in a network to another okay so one thing 
can calculate for a network get all the shortest paths between any pair of points in the network and 
that average is what we would call the average path length in the network which is basically a way 
quantifying this idea that the number six is not important just that a small number of steps from any 
to any other point even in a very big network like something the size of the world with seven 
sc but if your network were more like a lattice where you only knew your nearest neighbors then the 
path length would be enormous ss right if you picture a checker board like think of the nodes in 
network as being the squares of a checkerboard on a literally a checker board which is eight by eight 
you wanted to go from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner the fastest way you could get well 
could go down the diagonal i guess but that would still be eight squares in between sc yeah ss 
so there if the world starts getting big that shortest path is also getting very big it would not 
like in the if there were well seven sort of hard to take the square root chuckle sc do 
ten to the ss okay so yeah say if it was ten to the so we had ten billion 
on earth which we will pretty soon if ten billion people on earth and they were standing in this 
square checkerboard pattern that would then be as you said ten to the so people on each side of 
square sc degrees of separation chuckle ss i would say six degrees of separation say degrees of separation and 
one would say a small world it be the point being that worlds have to be small the checkerboard 
is not small and yet our world is small so that was a question that duncan and i wondered 
what does it take to make a world small the other question though is the commonsense answer to this 
does it take to make the world small comes from an old idea that like suppose i know one 
people or whatever number you wanna pick it could be but say i know them well enough that they 
lend me money maybe i have one hundred close friends and contacts and relatives okay so if i know 
hundred people and each of them knows one hundred people then naively i can just figure out how small 
world is by saying one hundred times one hundred or in your scientific notation chuckle ten to the two 
ten to the ten to the and if i wanna get to ten to the i have to do 
five times so be five degrees of separation if the world were such that i know one hundred people 
everyone else knows one hundred people except not the same one hundred people sc the trick ss in other 
if no overlap then the simple multiplication of one hundred times itself doing that five times that will be 
but the trick as you say the problem is that of the one hundred people i know when they 
one hundred people a lot of those are the same people because we live near each other or because 
the same profession or whatever and so what calling clustering the fact that not just a random choice of 
hundred people anywhere on earth so we have a more precise definition of clustering which is we you could 
of it this way think of two people you know and now ask do they know each other maybe 
do or maybe they like maybe someone thinking of right now is someone you went to high school with 
someone else is somebody that you know now from work and never met and they know each other okay 
those two people know each other even though they both know you but you could also think of two 
the people at work maybe they do know each other ss so the concept we had for clustering is 
any two of your friends and ask the probability that also friends of each other sc yeah okay ss 
number from oh to and in some types of worlds that number will be very small and close to 
and in other types of worlds it would be also we used expressions like we imagined kind of fraternity 
laughter the only people you know are the people in your fraternity so of course two of your friends 
know each other in the fraternity too ss okay so in that kind of world the clustering coefficient as 
called it will be very close to almost a certainty that your friends will know each other whereas if 
picked your one hundred friends at random on the surface of the earth one in ethiopia and one in 
and then each of them pick their friends at random one hundred friends somewhere else on earth very little 
that two friends of yours would know each other the odds are way against it that they would no 
pick out of their one hundred people out of ten billion why would they pick those same friends sc 
these two examples these are sort of the classic kinds of networks that people have been thinking about either 
knows everybody else so lots of clustering and the path is also very short or nobody knows anybody else 
so the path can be short but no clustering is that right ss well see if we got that 
sc nah i think i get it right ss i think not quite like the checkerboard world or actually 
often use a checkerboard we used to like to think of it as people standing in a circle if 
ten billion people were just standing out there in a big circle where the one hundred people they know 
the ones right next to them in the circle so i have fifty friends on my left and fifty 
my right and i know anybody else and the same for everybody else in the circle the same thing 
very big world for me to get a message say to someone diametrically opposite me i have to go 
around in steps of and gonna take a long time to get over to five billion people away sc 
path length very long but clustering very high ss yeah there is clustering yeah high clustering because of my 
friends on either side they will overlap a lot as i move to my friends so those worlds that 
of world has very high clustering but very long path and the other kind of world the random world 
very small but it has no clustering and so what we thought was this kind of paradoxical thing is 
our lives it feels like our lives are very clustered most of our friends do know each other or 
least many of them do much more so than if the world were random but yet the world seems 
almost as small as if it were random and so that obvious could you have both because the real 
somehow does have both could you make a model that has both and what duncan and i realized but 
him was that what was really important i mean one way to do it and we thought this was 
way it was probably done is if people had a certain number of farflung connections ss to give you 
example of what talking about i used to play a lot of chess on the internet and i got 
be friends with a guy in holland i mean i would say he was really my friend i knew 
many kids he had and i knew about his life and i never met him actually facetoface but i 
like he was my friend but the point being if i wanted to get a message to somebody in 
i could use my link to him and be a chance he would know that person or know someone 
would know the person in other words there was this bridge where i was suddenly connected to somebody i 
no business being connected to except that we both like to play chess on the internet and that bridge 
only made me closer to everyone in holland but everyone that i know is also now much closer to 
in holland although they realize it sc right right ss because they know me and i can take the 
sc and likewise more conceptually if you had a friend from high school who is now a classical pianist 
you have a whole bunch of connections a short distance to you to everyone in the classical music world 
exactly right and so interesting about this mechanism we called it shortcuts is that the shortcuts really make the 
very small very quickly though you sense it because you realize connected to everyone in the classical music world 
right ss because it sort of operate in your consciousness but you are and so this shortcut mechanism we 
that very very few shortcuts were enough to make the world incredibly small and that seemed to be a 
generic phenomenon that because it took so few of them it seemed like most networks would have this property 
you kind of in order to avoid it you had to scrupulously avoid having any shortcuts in a network 
we made a prediction back well i guess it now spacing out when did that paper come out sc 
was a while ago yeah i always hate thinking about these things ss it just was it was about 
anniversary i think it sc okay yeah ss yeah that sounds right yeah the paper came out in and 
we had said the brain for instance will turn out to be a small world network when we can 
all the we yet measured all the connections between all the neurons estimated to be trillions of neurons in 
brain tens of trillions i think so we know what the connectome as they call it is for the 
but we do know the connectome of a tiny worm the one nervous system been completely mapped out called 
sc oh yeah my favorite little tiny worm ss yeah so we know every neuron in its body about 
hundred of them only a something like on the order of a thousand cells in the whole creature but 
looking at the nervous system of this worm we show that it actually satisfied our criteria for a small 
that it was much more clustered than a random world but it also had path length about comparable to 
random world so it was as small as it could be while much more clustered sc and the internet 
a whole bunch of other networks in the real ss yeah a bunch of other networks lots of real 
networks and since then in the twenty years since then been abundantly documented that our prediction was right lots 
naturally occurring networks will be small world and you could ask okay so but interesting is that small worlds 
for very fast propagation of information through these shortcuts so anything that needs to coordinate itself or act as 
coordinated unit but is very big a small world mechanism is a really good way to do it but 
dangerous in the case of like the hiv example anything that can spread for good or for bad will 
much faster on a small world than it would on say on a lattice or a ring sc and 
typically a wonderful example of selforganization nobody planned it out you said naturally occurring mechanisms that typically give rise 
networks just like this ss right found all over the place and as you say no central plan or 
need to design it it just sort of happens on its own i did wanna mention one thing earlier 
that i sort of i had in my head but say out loud which was that another way of 
the world small that you could imagine which we deliberately did not imagine which is you could imagine that 
that everybody knows right if everybody knows lois weisberg i use that example because malcom gladwell wrote an article 
long time ago called six degrees of lois weisberg that she was this person in chicago that seemed to 
jazz musicians and she knew newspaper people and just everybody knew lois weisberg anyway one way that the world 
be small if everyone knows these superhubs these connectors sc right ss then of course just a few degrees 
all close to lois weisberg but we think that was really gonna first of all that felt like cheating 
course that will make the world small if you have that but more to the point we thought not 
gonna be how nature will use it not the mechanism because for one thing hard for the lois weisbergs 
there to maintain all those connections a lot of energetic cost a lot just hard sc and you need 
right ss well you need it i mean of course you might have it but you need it the 
mechanism and you need only a very few of those cost much and that will do the job for 
so we deliberately also i would say that i had been told by my friends in neuroscience that every 
in the brain connects to about that is make synapses with about others sc okay ss which might sound 
a lot but then when you remember that a trillion neurons in the brain or something like that or 
one hundred billion but way way more than sc i think eightyfive billion yeah but a lot ss yeah 
right so on order of a one hundred billion so right so if ten to the but only ten 
the synapses per sc yeah ss a factor of ten to the difference so a very sparse network in 
sense not connected to anything like the whole network and there are no lois weisbergs in the brain so 
deliberately wanna pay attention to those networks and the reason harping on this is because we missed the boat 
turns out that there are a lot of networks that use hubs the most obvious being airports if you 
of the airport system and for air travel you fly to a hub and the hub has a lot 
routes going into it so there are some networks that use this hub mechanism to make the world small 
so that was studied by other people and we like i say an interesting thing like in the history 
science that sometimes have a prejudice about what you think the way the world should be and you deliberately 
yourself entertain another possibility it strikes you as ugly or too simple or irritating in some way and so 
the world is very irritating it keeps doing different things in different circumstances in different models full employment but 
a little bothersome sometimes ss anyway those kinds of networks with the hubs were an analysis of them came 
the year after our paper on the small world réka albert and her advisor laszlo barabási wrote a paper 
what they called scalefree networks that had not only hubs but also a distribution the jargon is degree how 
connections any individual node has how many friends in our earlier social network analogy so if you ask how 
people have say ten friends how many have one hundred friends how many have one thousand friends you can 
people with more or less big rolodexes and it obeyed a power law in that there was the probability 
having a certain number of friends went down like the number of friends to some power it was an 
like one over x to some power but close to three or so something sc so that technically would 
a smallworld network but it has this extra feature that there are also lois weisbergs ss there were lois 
and also sort of like things a little bit less than lois weisbergs you had sort of lois weisbergs 
all scales of degree they were small worlds they have the right clustering properties actually at least in the 
models so we missed the hubs barabási and albert missed the clustering and since then people have figured out 
real networks are more complicated than the models either of us proposed which was no surprise we were both 
out really idealized simple models more like for thought experiments sc because this is within the realm of selforganization 
kind of networks we can speculate a little bit late in the podcast these are at the heart of 
complexity and complicated interconnected systems arise in a world that is ultimately governed by the second law of thermodynamics 
things run down ss well all i can say is that both of these are common network themes the 
theme and the scalefree there are a lot of other things going on learned a lot more about networks 
the past twenty years so they were very stimulating early ideas i think we could say that i claim 
either one of them is in kind the smallworld law is pretty much a universal law that almost every 
world network is gonna be a small world by our criteria sc yeah ss scalefree has not held up 
well but still a pretty common theme to say if the power law part is the part not reliable 
you just ask the distribution of degrees something that obeys a heavy meaning it look like a bell shape 
with a exponentially damped tail but it has something got a lot more of these lois weisbergs than you 
think sc yeah ss that does seem to be true sc yeah a heavy tail distribution has a lot 
things you might think are unlikely or improbable than you would get by doing the sort of traditional bell 
probability distributions ss right sc and so the world is full of things like that and still learning to 
with that maybe earthquakes or solar flares are examples of these which means that terrible disasters can happen a 
more frequently than we might guess ss true there are a lot of those heavy tail distributions in natural 
yeah with floods wildfires the statistics of those are often very heavytailed sc so okay clearly we have enough 
for a whole another podcast down the line that is good but i do want to give you the 
you mentioned right at the beginning how the very favorite tool of every mathematician which is calculus an obvious 
to the kinds of studies you wanted to do with the fireflies where there seemed to be some kind 
discontinuous jump and nevertheless your most recent book is about calculus so i think many people think of calculus 
nothing new there done calculus a long time ago and in fact my memory of it is one might 
a terrible class i had in high school what is it that you think makes us need another book 
calculus right now ss well i would sing the praises of calculus i think one of the greatest achievements 
the history of humanity this is something that took about more than two thousand years to develop starting from 
days of archimedes up through isaac newton and leibniz and taking a very broad view of what i mean 
calculus but say roughly speaking the systematic use of infinity to solve hard problems sc right ss the thrilling 
in calculus that you can take a hard problem and chop it up into infinitely that is infinitely many 
small pieces and then those turn out to be easier problems to solve those small ones and then if 
can figure out a way to put them back together which is what we call integral calculus or integrating 
differential equation then you can do the kind of math that has changed the world the math that let 
predict the phenomenon of wireless letting us talk to each other right now sc yeah but i always try 
gloss calculus as saying the statement that a mediumsized thing can be thought of as an infinite number of 
small things ss yeah a great great insight and it literally changed the world we without it we have 
we have television we have turned the tide in the fight against hiv so in the book trying to 
infinite powers and trying to make the case about just how revolutionary calculus was when it was invented and 
still giving us gifts today and i feel that a need to do it while true as you say 
the newest thing under the sun a lot of people in fact like a million more than a million 
in the us alone take calculus every year and for them something that they do the advanced placement test 
they know what the heck why did i do that chuckle often just taught as a lot a lot 
learn a lot of technical things to learn about how to do this kind of integral or that kind 
derivative but i feel like the great human story of this fantastic idea that i would rank right up 
with evolution and quantum theory this is a fantastic thing that i want people to understand just how rich 
story is and how world changing it was and still is ss so why to me not another calculus 
a book we know it those of us who are professional scientists know these things but i think that 
typical high school student or even someone who might be teaching it in high school they may not realize 
very broad context of what calculus has done for the world sc well jennifer wrote a book about calculus 
the calculus diaries and the gimmick was that a english major learns calculus and learns to apply it to 
world so i was helpful as an experimental test subject when we went to vegas or drove a car 
just noticed all the different ways in which you could think about the phenomena using calculus so i completely 
with you that people just quite appreciate how absolutely universal it is and if you really get what calculus 
trying to tell you your view of the world changes in a profound way ss perfect chuckle right exactly 
i feel like that needs to be better known that this just be for insiders i i feel a 
thing an inspiring thing and so i know there are people out there who would like to know this 
i should say written the book for this sort of person that actually that you and i both like 
write for the educated person curious but who is not a professional physicist or mathematician or may not have 
taken these subjects in college maybe was happy to be done with them in high school sc yeah well 
think what makes it interesting because we a preexisting resonance with the word calculus in many minds and it 
be positive so you have a blank slate to deal with trying to push up against some resistance and 
fun challenge to take up ss yes it is yup sc alright steven strogatz thanks so much for your 
ss thank you sean this was great fun sc definitely be recommending all your books and i wanna read 
about small worlds and scalefree networks and things like that and maybe have you on the podcast again to 
into them further ss oh okay my pleasure i hope i will sc alright thanks a lot music as 
wannabe amateur physicist or mathematician i really enjoyed this episode i listen to about of your political ones and 
the complex theoretical ones but this one i listened to twice and shared with several friends what happened to 
the download links on the web pages each podcast used to have a download link right above the click 
show episode transcript link this stopped after episode fifteen note the download link in the following url you can 
from the podcast player the icon that looks like a downward arrow pointing at a shelf thanks for this 
it was very enriching love a future episode with dr strogatz a great communicator and has so much to 
i was looking forward to this but it seems you have enough time to go much beyond fireflies another 
who studies complex systems would be welcome maybe stuart kauffman thanks for all the comments are closed sean carroll
