above to close sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and you 
notice still in that mode where my voice is not sorry about that the times when you listen to 
podcasts are not obviously correlated with the times when recording the intros to the podcasts which are obviously not 
to the times when i record the main part of the podcast this is a spread out over time 
of operation we have here at mindscape so sorry about that but hopefully understandable because i wanna talk about 
little bit different thing for the podcast today gonna dive into history everyone knows that important to try to 
lessons from history we have things going on right now we live in a time here in the united 
and in the world where history is happening all around us when many of us think we think of 
empire and the caesars but the empire was preceded by the roman republic which flourished for a full five 
why after such a long and prosperous run would an essentially democratic form of government change largely with the 
of its citizens into an autocracy the question i discuss with guest historian edward watts a fascinating story with 
contemporary resonances especially how reformers navigated the choices between working within the system to overthrowing it entirely lessons for

to go to look into the past to try to learn lessons for what we should be doing now 
easy to be too superficial about that easy to point to the nazis and compare everything to the nazis 
sure back way back in the day they compared everything to the mongols and genghis khan and worried about 
mongols lots of things that happened in history and all of them can teach us something but in subtly 
ways so today going to examine a crucial time in history and tease out some of the possible implications 
the present but gonna try not to be too simplistic gonna leave most of the implications to your minds 
guest is edward watts who is a pulitzer prizewinning historian at uc san diego his work focuses on the 
empire and times and places around that but what gonna talk about today is actually the decline of the 
republic the transitional period that ended the republic and led in to the roman empire the roman empire looms 
in our cultural background but the roman republic that preceded it lasted for five hundred years and was very 
it was a wonderful example of a longlasting stable democracyrepublic and then it changed it went into an empire 
the empire had various good qualities but still you get to vote the people have a voice in an 
system like they do in a republic system so what happened sc of course being that the roman empire 
know a lot there were people writing about what was happening and not always reliable we have to extrapolate 
use our wits a little bit but a whole bunch of stories about what happened in those last one 
fifty years before the fall of the republic particularly fond of the story of the gracchi brothers i know 
this probably to some of the history buffs in the audience this is old news but there are two 
in the late roman republic who on the one hand you can argue were trying to do good things 
the people of rome broadly construed for the people of the republic on the other hand they had a 
to violate the norms by which the government was running and the republic was operating so a debate right 
do you violate the norms when is it sufficiently bad the conditions that are going on around you that 
need to take dramatic action sc easy to make an argument that the norms just benefit the welloff right 
their norm violation one can also argue led to the normalization of the use of violence to achieve political 
which then contributed to the decline and fall of the republic and replaced by a monarchy so what lessons 
wanna draw from that never easy not gonna be actually telling you what the right lessons are i do 
though that the more we know and understand history the more informed our choices will be going forward so 
music sc edward watts welcome to the mindscape podcast edward watts thank you glad to be here sc so 
think come as no surprise that not a professional historian in fact i think safe to say most of 
knowledge of the history of rome comes from shakespeare plays and i think i can even go further and 
that probably not that atypical to think that when people say ancient rome i think of the empire basically 
i think of as the cool interesting part of the history of rome but there was a republic for 
of years before that and there was even a kingdom before that so interested in the republic and especially 
latter days but set up how we got to the republic even the kingdom was kind of interesting it 
hereditary crown like we think of it now ew right yeah i think that thinking about roman history across 
full scope is really intriguing because the roman state such as it is is there for years it starts 
the roman kingdom and it ends with cannons and the fall of constantinople in and very very few things 
history where you have that much continuity but seeing how it starts in some ways it looks radically different 
how it ends but in other ways the continuity is very easy to see so the roman state when 
starts up is a monarchy as best we can tell but a monarchy in which the king is dependent 
and interacting with this group of hereditary aristocracy that the king generally belongs to ew and so the monarchy 
something in which the king is chosen from among this group of patricians the king is accountable to this 
of patricians and when the king dies power goes back to the group of patricians and each of the 
members of each family take a turn auditioning as king and after a year passes one of them is 
and king for the rest of his life and at the end of that power goes back to the 
what happens towards the end of the monarchy is there is a what i suppose we would call almost 
class revolt where the nature of power in the roman state has begun to shift and you have an 
between the people who belong to the hereditary aristocracy and the people who are becoming wealthy and then there 
people outside of this aristocracy who start becoming wealthy and you have a king who seizes power on the 
of appealing to these newly wealthy but politically not completely disenfranchised but largely disenfranchised people sc the nouveau riche 
ew right right and what ends up happening is the patricians lose control of this accountability that had that 
governed their interactions with the king now the king is accountable to other people what the republic represents is 
patrician counterrevolution where these kings who are loyal to this new classbased structure are now not listening to patricians 
a way that really discourages patricians and patricians overthrow this new kingship structure and create something that starts out 
the patricians running things without a king at all and this is how the republic starts an incredibly conservative 
and the idea of the republic appealed to these patricians in large part because the roman republic like a 
republic is a state in which everybody has a voice but the voice is not allocated equally some people 
more of a voice and when the republic starts patricians have much more of a voice than anybody else 
i should say for listeners at home if you hear little bits of moaning and squealing in the background 
local dog juno she has opinions and cheap trip in perfectly fine so the so in the early days 
the republic it everyone gets a vote right the and who chooses the patricians how do you get to 
a patrician ew so a patrician simply because you belong to a family that is patrician there are cases 
people get moved into this order and this is the thing really challenging for us been trained to think 
societies that are hierarchical mainly organized on class and in the roman republic not the patrician order has nothing 
do with how wealthy you are and part of the challenge that the roman republic faces is there are 
which the romans called plebeians who were wealthier than some patricians ew and the republic struggled for about two 
years to figure out how you balance the authority that rich plebeians can claim in the rest of society 
the authority that patricians have arrogated to themselves in the republic and eventually what they come up with is 
series of messy compromises where plebeians are able to hold assemblies and vote on laws without patricians being involved 
the laws are supposed to actually bind everybody in the state including patricians ew and the series of compromises 
unfold are deliberately messy and ambiguity that is left where plebeians have authority that if they exercised it to 
fullest extent could be used to do really horrible things to patricians and they choose not to i mean 
have ways to block plebeians from doing these things as well and they choose not to and instead you 
this very elegant system where the laws provide certain ways to exercise power but there are understandings unwritten understandings 
deeply understood ideas about what is not acceptable you push your powers to the fullest extent imaginable sc some 
just done it was understood ew destabilizing sc yeah right ew and in no interest to do that if 
patrician destabilization leads to violence and probably going to end badly for you sc and one thing i noticed 
there was this i even think of it but there were votes there were ballots but they were public 
when you voted people know who you voted for right and the innovation of a secret ballet was a 
deal laughter sc laughing at juno she does not like secret ballots but okay go along with it ew 
the first three hundred fifty years of the republic your ballot was something that actually was spoken it was 
who you were voting for and the idea there was you were accountable and the other idea there that 
buried beneath this is if somebody paid you for your vote which was illegal but was done and done 
regularly they could tell whether the payment actually worked when you moved to secret ballots the initial secret balloting 
of a piece of paper and you would walk down a plank and then you would drop this into 
basket but people could stand there and see what was on the piece of paper sc see what was 
it yeah ew and a series of reforms in the get you from you have to announce your vote 
and clear so everybody can hear it to a very narrow walkway where no one can actually observe what 
on the piece of paper sc so it was more really secret ew it was really secret at that 
sc and that annoyed some people they like it ew it annoyed a lot of people sc how can 
bribe people if they stay bribed if i know who voting for ew and the interesting thing is quite 
that you could then take multiple bribes and this was in some ways something that was supposed to discourage 
malfeasance because you actually know if you got what you paid for and you actually know whether this person 
took money from six different people and voted for two of them and what could you do sc okay 
that is a relatively late thing i do wanna just sort of put ourselves in the mindset of understanding 
roman republic i mean it the first exercise in democracy in the ancient world it came after athenian democracy 
was it the first republic was the idea of a republic around i mean i guess in the united 
or in the french revolution we think about being influenced by philosophers right by locke and rousseau and hobbes 
there an explicit idea was there some philosophical justification for doing things one way rather than another ew well 
when we compare the roman republic to athenian democracy i think important to say that romans would have found 
democracy absolutely abhorrent there any assembly that was based on that principle where a majority would sc vote ew 
vote and then that would decide it sc like a democracy yeah ew and if plus that decided it 
the roman assemblies tended to do is they grouped people together in certain ways and the votes would be 
in the context of a voting tribe or a voting century and whatever that majority was would count as 
vote towards whatever decision was being made so your vote was always channeled through some other structure and the 
felt that this was ideal they never in any sense wanted this to be a situation where people just 
carry an idea on the basis of having fifty plus sc so it was almost like government by deliberation 
consensus rather than just majority rules ew exactly the basic idea that governed what romans were doing was a 
of better to do nothing than to do the wrong thing and better to do nothing than to do 
that a very narrow majority of the population supports and the idea behind and they articulate this in the 
that a greek political thinker would articulate this but the idea behind that was once you make a decision 
a large number of people in this state have signed on to they own it and very hard then 
step back and say was terrible we need to turn sc you just blame the other party right ew 
athenian democracy did that all the time the case of alcibiades is the greatest example of this where they 
him out to command a fleet and three days later they send another ship saying wait you need to 
laughter the roman republic work that way and it was by design there was no interest on the part 
romans in empowering the people to the point where you could have these radical changes in policy instead what 
supposed to happen and a lot of times did happen most of the time did happen was all of 
stakeholders would come together and propose an idea and try to make that idea workable to the broadest group 
people in the roman state so you could get this consensus sc and it was pretty successful right i 
rome both flourished internally and expanded a great deal in this time like when is the beginning to end 
the roman republic ew so conventionally the roman republic starts in five hundred nine bc there is some debate 
that date but i think generally speaking a good starting point it ends effectively somewhere between thirty and twentyseven 
sc okay yeah ew you sc almost five hundred years ew almost five hundred years but if you were 
ask the emperor augustus sort of state do you live he would say a sc right laughter ew you 
people who claim that there are still elements of the republic that are still sort of percolating through roman 
into the augustine period and even past augustus but i think if you asked any roman who was gonna 
honestly they would say the republic ended around twentyseven bc sc okay but it did flourish over those five 
years ew yeah yeah and for the first almost four hundred of it the republic was remarkably successful in 
more or less what it was charged to do creating an entity that prevented anybody from assuming power by 
and creating a political process that governed the rights and prevented violent exercises and violent conflict that dominated the 
life and what the republic did was it promised effectively peace and freedom from tyranny sc and who were 
stakeholders i mean who got a vote in some sense ew every citizen had a vote sc and what 
it mean to be a citizen of rome ew so the other genius that the romans had and this 
them almost entirely unique in the ancient world the romans extended citizenship quite widely so the city of rome 
course when founded this is the core of roman citizenship but as the city of rome conquered more territories 
awarded citizenship to people that they conquered not everybody and not all the time but in large enough quantities 
you reach a point by the end of the second century bc where there were millions of people who 
some form of roman citizenship and as the republic expands the number of places that enjoy roman citizenship expands 
well so by eightyeight bc all of italy holds roman citizenship and by two hundred twelve ad everybody in 
roman empire from britain to sudan from iraq to morocco holds roman citizenship sc to be fair we have 
mention slaves did not get to vote chuckle ew well and women get to vote sc and women get 
vote were there races that get to vote they just given roman citizenship ew sc not a concept that 
then back then ew there are concepts like that but generally speaking romans feel that they saw racial differences 
they saw ethnic differences and they saw geographic differences but they see racial differences in the way that say 
in the century in the united states would see racial differences and they feel that anybody of a certain 
background or geographic background should be excluded from citizenship just because this is their background sc and so there 
people in north africa for example who would get a vote in the roman republic ew not in the 
well there are some there are some not many citizenship really comes to north africa in large quantities in 
late second and early third centuries sc but it was a time of expansion for rome right even before 
empire the republic kept getting more and more territory under its purview ew yes yeah and what the republic 
able to do and what leaders of the republic are able to do is they recognize that even in 
period i mean really a future of the empire that rome starts incorporating large numbers of people from places 
greece and north africa but even in the republic there was an idea that extending citizenship to individuals who 
useful prominent people government people this was something you know that made some sense i mean caesar would do 
in gaul for example where prominent gallic chieftains would get roman citizenship and they would take a roman name 
and so you have these family inscriptions in gaul where you have somebody who has a crazy gallic name 
then their son is julius caesar crazy gallic name and then the son of that person is just a 
roman name and the in latin and it commemorates this transition from completely not roman to roman citizen to 
who really see much difference between himself and somebody living in the city of rome sc so they were 
good assimilators that was part of their genius ew very good at this yeah sc yeah and okay so 
couple of hundred years of successful life as a republic in rome and part of it was the sort 
gradual deliberate consensusbased approach i mean a lot more inertia built into the system intentionally in the roman republic 
versus athenian democracy as you say but then we hit a trouble spot around one hundred thirty bc with 
story of the gracchis and yeah confess i had never heard the story before starting reading your book and 
digging into the details but such a fascinating story why you tell us about these two brothers starting with 
i guess was the first one right ew yeah so these are two brothers tiberius gracchus and then his 
gaius gracchus and tiberius is the older brother by quite a bit and tiberius comes from a family that 
in essence if the kennedys married the bushes this is the blueest blood most sought sc not a rabble 
from the streets chuckle ew no no somebody wellplaced to do really well in political life and incredibly skilled 
wonderful orator someone who is very good at building personal relationships and also somebody with a distinguished military career 
i remember there was a line in your book i actually bring a copy of the book so i 
it but i loved it because it reminds us this is ancient rome not modern united states he came 
this incredibly establishment family and he was trained in philosophy and oratory to succeed in politics but not what 
do these days with our politicians laughter ew no no and it is something that is a useful tool 
even in the roman republic there are people who did this and people who but what tiberius gracchus understood 
these are tools that can be deployed in certain contexts and be deployed very usefully and he understood not 
how to use rhetoric but when to use rhetoric and so he is a person who is on the 
track to being a really prominent roman politician but a really prominent establishment roman politician and in the course 
one of his junior offices he is holding a position more or less managing the books in a campaign 
spain and the campaign goes drastically wrong and the army ends up captured and tiberius gracchus negotiates the surrender 
and the liberation of the roman captives but when they come back to the city of rome people on 
other side of the political divide who start demagoguing this and saying that romans surrender and romans negotiate and 
you surrender your life is and this is a principle that romans abstractly believe but not one that romans 
like to put to the test sc from an objective point of view it seems that the negotiation that 
did was actually pretty successful ew it was quite successful sc yeah chuckle ew yeah he got the entire 
out and in return he had to agree basically to a peace treaty that was not favorable to rome 
he saved tens of thousands of lives sc they gave back some of the loot that they had plundered 
ew yeah sc okay so just do that and save the lives ew yeah and so he comes home 
people in the senate who are conservative and are looking for an issue to really attack not even tiberius 
the commander who was responsible for this say that this be done you know romans we negotiate we sc 
negotiate with terrorists ew yeah we make this kind of concession to people who are less than us and 
gets kind of caught in the middle not really about him but the families of the soldiers that tiberius 
to liberate rally around him and the effort to completely undo this peace agreement falters because so much popular 
that in the end they send the commander back and they let the army stay but everybody remembered what 
had done that tiberius had shown up this establishment push to punish what seemed like a completely antiroman type 
behavior and so this is remembered and tiberius understands this sc this is remembered by people in political power 
have control in some sense over his future political career ew yeah this is remembered by the establishment sc 
ew and first act was as an establishment figure not one anymore and so what tiberius realizes is if 
wants to have a future political and he had done well but he done as well as his family 
and he done as well as previous generations had and a problem in a roman context you know if 
do as well politically as your father did failed i mean you have failed and it looks badly for 
it looks badly for your children and so tiberius has to make a decision about whether going to step 
and potentially not advance any further politically or if going to in a sense lean in to this populist 
that fallen into by accident sc right so he has the support of all these families who are not 
politically connected but that his constituency but those are the people who are on his side right now ew 
very enthusiastic and then the soldiers whose lives he saved back in rome citizens and they can vote very 
as well and so he leans into this and he begins crafting a second act that is as a 
and a lot of things for him to run on what had happened after invasion of italy and the 
victory in the second punic war was a massive rebuilding of italy that benefited everybody but in the context 
this a financial revolution that grows out of the massive amount of government contracts that are now coming into 
people have to bid in advance for these and if the contracts are for things like mineral extraction you 
pay in advance and then you go and extract the minerals and if you can get more your profit 
if you get less too bad for you ew nobody has that kind of money and so what ends 
happening very quickly is people take out loans who want to work on these contracts and romans realized that 
could figure out the likelihood that that loan is gonna be repaid the percentage likely to be repaid and 
amount of profit likely to come in and that meant the loan had value if you could figure out 
likelihood this is going to be repaid you can assess the value and then you can sell it sc 
is very modern all this conception long before adam smith but it was very capitalist and ew exactly exactly 
if you sell it then you can recapitalize and you can do it again sc right derivative trading ew 
and so for the first fifty years or so of the second century you have a situation where boats 
floating tide is rising poor people are rebuilding italy rich people are developing these mechanisms to generate wealth very 
quickly but around one hundred forty it slows down for poor people but it slow down for rich people 
what tiberius gracchus realizes is a perception problem here poor people are not becoming ridiculously poor but not gonna 
as well as their parents did rich people continue to get richer and richer and richer and tiberius gracchus 
for the office of tribune of the plebs which is an an elected office that allows you to propose 
to plebeians but tribunes tend to be more i suppose radical they can be more radical than people who 
elected to offices that will put them in the senate ew and what tiberius realizes is he could run 
tribune of the plebs and he could propose economic reforms and there will be a constituency for this there 
people who really feel that the situation is imbalanced the republic is not doing enough to fix this and 
has space to use the popular following he has to propose some solutions to this initially he wins election 
initially he proposes a law very similar to a law that had been proposed before and senatorial forces and 
forces and rich people say good enough for he wants to redistribute a certain amount of land and compensate 
people who were renting this public land he taking any private land at all sc yeah there there was 
a law saying this should happen and he was kind of the one to enforce it or is that 
bit too strong ew yeah so a tremendous amount of public land that the roman republic had taken from 
that had rebelled under hannibal and it they know what to do with it some of it they gave 
roman citizens but some of it they leased out to landholders many of them italian and so therefore they 
a say in going on in roman politics but there was supposed to be a sc not because of 
much you could handle ew yeah sc like a wealth cap which these days would not even be discussed 
conversation ew yeah i mean it would be like if you had restrictions on the amount of land that 
could graze in nevada sc per person yeah ew and everybody could only graze three hundred acres of land 
somebody starts grazing six hundred acres you can either enforce it or you can decide not worth enforcing and 
much of the second century romans decided this really worth enforcing what was proposed by an earlier politician and 
of rejuvenated by tiberius gracchus was to take people who had land in excess of the limit and just 
away the excess land that was public that they own and compensate them for the loss of this land 
they had been leasing and then give that land to people who were roman who have lands to farm 
this is a pretty moderate proposal but not something that there could yet be a consensus around and so 
tiberius sc and to remind ourselves the whole point of the republic and how it worked is that you 
slowly right and you build consensus and the ship of state is very stately ew yeah you wanna do 
going to upset a large number of people and even if it is something that benefits a lot of 
if not enough support for it that you can build enough of a consensus that people will allow it 
go through it probably ought not to go through because people will resist it and normally if you have 
proposal and you build a consensus for it you either try to negotiate a compromise or you let it 
in the earlier proposal like this the person who proposed it decided to let it drop he build a 
he find any compromises that would work so he let it drop tiberius gracchus decides not to let it 
sc right ew instead he realizes that he has this rhetorical ability incredible he has this fervent support among 
parts of the population and not gonna waste that and so what he does is he pushes into this 
this ambiguous space between what you traditionally did and what you could do and he starts doing everything that 
could do sc so there a law against what he was doing but people done it not supposed to 
it and he said stop chuckle ew he said so make it so he proposes the law and each 
the tribunes when a law is proposed have a veto over this one of them who is working with 
senate exercises his veto this is perfectly proper because the way that informally the senate and the patricians influenced 
happened in a plebeian assembly was they had a tribune who they would communicate with and say gonna the 
will take an opinion on one of these laws and usually enough but if the senate says think this 
a good and someone wants to push it forward a tribune who will work with the senate will veto 
and that will end it sc right ew so law is vetoed and tiberius brings his mob of supporters 
deposes the tribune who vetoed it and the mob of supporters is not violent but they are threatening and 
sc yeah that sounds a little extraprocedural there right chuckle ew yeah what he did is not illegal sc 
ew but it was done under conditions that seemed intimidating sc even the mob deposing the guy is not 
ew idea which again probably is influenced to some degree by what he had read in greek philosophy his 
was that the people are the ultimate empowering agent and so all legitimacy in the roman state resides with 
people and if the people decide they want to depose a magistrate exercising legitimate political power and this is 
idea that no one in rome had ever endorsed this is athenian democracy channeled through the structures of the 
republic and romans did not like that and romans generally would have resisted that except really scary laughter you 
you come into this assembly and really scary sc right ew and so tiberius deposes the tribune and tiberius 
his law passed the senate objects to this but the law is binding on everybody so then the senate 
the power to not fund the law because the one power that the senate indisputably has is allocating money 
things and to do this kind of land reform you need surveyors and you need people who will provide 
to the new farmers and you need all sorts of things to make this happen and the senate controls 
of the money that can make all of those things possible sc this part i thought was hilarious let 
have your law and your commission but you have no money to do anything with ew yeah yeah i 
and we see things like this in our government as well sc very i love it ew yeah chuckle 
so tiberius then has this tremendous act of fortune because the king who is in charge of a kingdom 
now turkey dies and in his will he leaves the entire kingdom to the roman people now the another 
that it controls another one of the few things that it controls is foreign affairs and so this is 
as a foreign action giving his kingdom to the roman people something the senate should deal with tiberius says 
a second chuckle the voice of the people is now channeled through all these agencies and the voice of 
people matters and so you just say the senate we represent that will says the roman people the roman 
will and so he brings forward a motion saying of the money in this treasury should go to fund 
land and there are people in the concilium plebis they vote for this sc they love it yeah ew 
tiberius gets his money for his land commission and again not illegal what he did but not done either 
been done yeah ew and then tiberius decides not really finished probably going to be some problems for him 
he leaves office he have any prospects to run for higher office quite yet and so he decides to 
again for the office of tribune of the plebs this again is not illegal but it done and so 
the voting starts up tiberius has his mob of supporters who are intimidating people and threatening people and senators 
are opposed to him have had enough now tiberius has never used violence and this is i think an 
thing ew he is not the one who brings violence like actual physical violence into the roman political arena 
used intimidation quite a bit and so when standing for reelection opponents bring in a mob and then the 
actually uses physical violence and kills tiberius gracchus the first incident the first violent incident in more than three 
years in sc and it was technically the senate or the senate ew yeah it was the actual physical 
came from opponents and a victim of it but the conditions that established the things that made it possible 
imagine that this would be necessary were conditions that tiberius had set sc can we judge his personal sincerity 
his reform efforts was he really devoted to the people or did he think that that was a politically 
tack to take ew i think both i think devoted to the people but i think also very aware 
this is useful to him sc right a complicated legacy because a reformer some kind of socialist democrat whatever 
to give land back to the people which maybe a good thing but like you say maybe the most 
part of his legacy is that he violated these norms and that shook down through the years ew yeah 
think the important thing to keep in mind when talking about this reform and tiberius gracchus has this historical 
where a lot of people especially on the left feel a protomarxist or a protoleftist hero if that reform 
gone through and he had redistributed all of the land estimated he probably would have settled about families and 
population in italy at this time is about four million not insignificant but not gonna solve the problem not 
radical solution and public property that giving so not redistributing wealth in any meaningful way not taking private property 
any meaningful way not doing anything to attack these people who are the new that are generating all of 
money really fast this is a modest reform and radical is just the way he pushed it sc and 
do want maybe this should be for later but we wanna say that any normbreaking is bad like in 
sense the american revolution the french revolution we took up arms against a monarchy and we think the american 
in any case worked out pretty well but you would like to make the argument that this was not 
time or place to violate those norms of governance ew yeah i think the republic would have gotten where 
wanted them to get it that big a thing and he invent this idea it would have gotten there 
his name have been attached to it and i think the big problem for tiberius gracchus is he wanted 
name attached to it he wanted the policy but he wanted his name attached to it as well sc 
a selection effect successful politicians are ambitious by construction and then he had a younger brother who in some 
tried to follow in his footsteps ew his younger brother i think is one of the true genuine heroes 
this whole period because he knew what he was getting into sc this is gaius ew this is gaius 
knew he would die he knew that what happened to tiberius would happen to him sc yeah we should 
the stakes were pretty high here people died when the things went wrong ew yeah and he knew that 
use intimidation and threats in the way his brother did because immediately the reaction would be he should die 
told has a dream before he even goes into politics he has a dream that he will die going 
pursue his legacy and he will die sc and they believed in prophesies at that time right ew and 
did yeah sc and that one came true ew so what he does is he thinks out or he 
a reform program that will genuinely make a difference a reform program that includes giving subsidized food to the 
in the city of rome it includes establishing colonies in places like the city of carthage that rome had 
in one hundred fortysix bc but is a really really good location and he proposed again land redistributions and 
the commission that his brother had set up and in a way that foresaw the future he proposed the 
of citizenships to everybody in italy and he genuinely wanted these things to happen sc and that last move 
an important one i think if we do wanna draw parallels to today because in some sense populists the 
brothers getting their support from a wide base but gaius wanted to expand who counts as roman which is 
sort of antitypical populist move ew yeah and there was a lot of pushback the reason that gaius wanted 
do this is because this economic and wealth inequality in italy just felt by romans it was also felt 
italians and a lot of the people who were in the lower classes and were feeling like they have 
to have as say a big a farm as their parents they started coming to the cities and especially 
the city of rome and so the city of rome that was probably a little more than people in 
hundred bc by the time of augustus a million and a lot of these people came starting in the 
part of the second century and a lot of them were roman citizens which meant they could be in 
city of rome but a lot of them roman citizens a lot of them were italians who moved to 
city of rome without citizenship status and were working there ew and about three years before gaius gracchus holds 
politicians in rome stage an arrest and deportation of these italians who belong in the city of rome the 
time this was done not the last time it would be done and so what gaius actually saw was 
policy that was a good policy politically not so good a policy the nonroman citizens vote for him so 
gonna get him any votes immediately now if they become citizens they could vote for him but in the 
term this a winning policy for him but a problem that needs to be solved and his policy was 
problemsolving solution that in many ways foresaw that this was only going to get worse sc right but it 
not work out well for gaius ew no no gaius i think understood full well what this would mean 
because gaius really did play by the rules he do the sorts of shenanigans his brother did the first 
that gaius is in office is really successful because no one really no one can block him consensus around 
ideas and a general sense that genuine in pursuing these things and so not looking to potentially take over 
state or some of the things that people feared tiberius was doing solving problems and so he runs for 
and the second term that he has his opponents make the interesting decision to in effect outbid him and 
he proposes citizenship for italians they propose more he proposes a colony they propose more colonies and they eat 
at his support by in a modern context or a modern sense moving to the left of him and 
then becomes not radical enough in his sc outflanking him from the left ew yeah and genius because he 
up losing support and then they stage an outbreak of violence and wrapped up in it and assassinated and 
of the other reforms that were trying to outflank him to the left ever come to anything they were 
political tactics and so gaius is i think one of the few i think unmitigated and unquestionable heroes in 
late republican period because he knew exactly what he was getting into he knew how this would end sc 
still it was one hundred years before the republic actually went away it as if the next day it 
so how do is it fair to trace these moves by the gracchi brothers to the ultimate decline of 
republic ew yes for a couple of reasons i think what tiberius gracchus does is he shows that normbreaking 
a political tool a useful political tool and one that if you go too far you will probably be 
severely but if you can figure out how to do it so that you get what you want but 
alarm people so much that they feel like you have to be killed very useful the other thing is 
use of violence against gaius also becomes something of a political tool again something where becoming normal enough that 
you can use violence against people that are opponents you otherwise work with and not directly involved okay you 
useful sc there was a new norm where a little bit of might makes right baked in ew yeah 
people begin experimenting with ways to do this so that it works but no blow back because tremendous blow 
against the people who killed the gracchi but by people are figuring out how to do this by say 
a mob of supporters all the time that you can then call out and they can make demonstrations and 
can attack supporters of other people and you can intimidate politicians without directly attacking politicians sometimes it gets out 
control but you enter into this cycle where something explodes an act of violence everybody says this is horrible 
retrenchment a new status quo is established it holds for a little while and romans begin to think the 
is back and stable and past this point where so much friction and and then it starts up again 
and i think the story that starts with the gracchi is the cyclical story of political dysfunction violence a 
a settling of the system for a little while maybe a decade maybe a generation everybody kind of gets 
to the fact that there are now rules that govern this and they begin to take for granted the 
that the republic is stable and people start playing these games again violating norms to push their own personal 
and ultimately getting back to another crisis sc and to put ourselves in their shoes we think of the 
revolution two hundred years ago as really long ago right and to these romans the republic had been around 
four hundred years already which their history was not as good their record keeping it just seemed like forever 
presume ew yeah sc the idea that there be a republic just appear to them probably ew and i 
the other thing important for us to do is to actually live this in their time a day is 
day and so if something happened ten years ago that seems like a long time ago and when something 
happening in a cycle that repeats every twentyfive years say perfectly reasonable to think when in the middle of 
cycle if your republic is four hundred years old okay back to normal okay and you realize that this 
unfolding not on a timeline of a year or five years but unfolding on a timeline of like a 
hundred years sc which is impossible for human beings to really care about ew no and so your sense 
history is what you can remember in effect and i think the other thing important is when you look 
the demographic charts for romans pretty dire but if you make it past five years old you have a 
good chance of making it to but then once you get to the cliff really starts appearing sc still 
today chuckle feeling it so i get it ew yeah so i feel it too but what that means 
if you have a cycle the violence is starting when in your and then it settles down when about 
then you have a good twelve or fifteen years where yeah it looks like you understand how things are 
it looks like things have settled down and this would be say after gaius gracchus this period of retrenchment 
a few aristocratic families who then more or less dominate the state for about fifteen years okay if twentyfive 
gaius gracchus dies forty when that starts breaking down and fifty by the time another burst of really serious 
dead the people who were experiencing and when violence breaks out again around most of them remember the gracchi 
political experience is of stability and this general decline in the same way that millennials who lived through the 
government shutdown remember the gingrich government shutdown because they were five years old sc but also this brings up 
question i had about where the information and knowledge comes from i presume that most romans are not literate 
know not newspapers but do they have books or is it just all oral tradition where they learn about 
from the past ew so the literacy question is a really good one i think based on what we 
in pompeii we can say that not certainly not say like a modern society where it approaches but not 
bad as you would think either i think what you see in pompeii is people of all social classes 
read from slaves all the way and prostitutes all the way up to the most elite people who have 
the percentage is really hard to gauge but functional literacy on some level is probably pushing sc pretty impressive 
but reading history is probably sc how was news passed around were there proclamations in the square or ew 
there are laws that are posted there are inscriptions that dictate ideas or policies a lot of written material 
over the place and i think interesting in this context is election campaigns a lot of the electioneering there 
placards and there are electoralrelated graffiti and we know this mainly from pompeii but in pompeii even deep in 
empire pompeii the eruption is around eighty ad so already more than one hundred years into the empire still 
elections going on in pompeii and you can see the way campaigning tends to work and so i think 
there is a general sense of what someone stands for when they campaign and how they fit into a 
trajectory and also i think a lived memory of who somebody is and what they represent sc sure ew 
the history the understanding of the past is really i think going to be something where what lived through 
going to feel much more immediate than anything before that and there is a real challenge in roman history 
you really have any kind of narrative histories written by romans until the time of hannibal and so all 
this stuff from the early republic and from the royal period circulating but circulating as stories and these stories 
to take on the tenor of morality tales and so when understanding contemporary events you are mixing say if 
in the year the gracchi with these figures from the fifth century and with roman kings sc yeah romulus 
remus ew yeah and importing virtue virtue from these deep traditions into what the gracchi are doing and i 
that also leads to you missing the real kind of progression that living through sc yeah and so you 
the point about the timescale of eruptions of violence and so forth but also i know whether economic or 
changes where more and more power in armies was associated with individuals rather than with the state ew yeah 
this is something that comes out of that period in the where that stability under these elite families it 
in large part because these elite families become quite corrupt which is not sc no surprised at that ew 
so what ends up happening is a figure who runs against this a man named marius and he does 
in the context of a roman war with a north african kingdom that rome should have won easily but 
really struggling to fight effectively and he runs against the commander who belongs to the most elite and most 
of these families that had dominated political life for the last decade and runs against him as corrupt and 
and neither one of those things was actually true but it makes the moment to do that and so 
he wins election he has to build an army and everybody feels like rome is exhausted and not going 
find troops and generally speaking when romans raised armies they tended to only bring people into the army who 
property above a certain level ew and what marius understood was he probably gonna get an army if he 
to live within those means so what he decides to do is raise an army with any volunteer willing 
serve and all of a sudden he gets a very very enthusiastic and loyal army that he takes to 
africa they win the war and then he wins a series of elections to use this and other armies 
confront german barbarians to the north sc because we should say back in those days people are enthusiastic they 
the army in part because they thought that was a route to looting and riches right ew it could 
a couple of things you get out of it one is if you win the campaign lots of stuff 
you can get lots of loot and riches that you can take home but also a sense that the 
might reward you and soldiers in particular come to believe that done such a good job and they have 
so the republic should provide them with property and what marius ends up doing is working with allies to 
a retirement package for his soldiers when his term of office is up and this is wonderful but what 
means effectively is every other commander now has to do the same thing and every other commander now has 
that realize that their retirement package their discharge bonus basically is going to depend on the political fortunes of 
guy who recruited them ew and so eventually again now you have a new variable that is illegal you 
your army to march on rome to get these things but you can have your army show up and 
angry sc and brandish a spear or two ew yeah tiberius gracchus style and you can use the threat 
they might do this as a political tool and people start doing this and in the end there is 
commander in the who feels this is the commander sulla he feels like he actually needs to make use 
the tool not threats but actually marching the army on rome and sulla does this and the troops are 
to do this because for fifteen years from marius to march on rome this has just become part of 
troops expect loyal to your commander serving the state but your loyalty is to your commander sc one gonna 
the goods ew and the minute your commander is not loyal to the state he could ask you to 
and no one had asked anyone to choose until sulla but once sulla asks them to choose this again 
a political tool and a political tool that lots of people will use sc and so over and over 
you get this thing where something that just done until someone does it because what their incentives are and 
once done the floodgates are open ew yeah but again the pacing is important the floodgates are open in 
someone else can do this but they generally they know been done but not like well sulla does it 
then done again because sulla provokes a civil war but after that civil war calms down nobody really does 
again someone tries it in the someone tries it in the but no one actually does it for real 
caesar and this is in sc julius caesar ew julius caesar yeah but once it was done it was 
the vocabulary of things you could do and that meant that there could come a moment where somebody would 
do it it happen immediately again when in this when in this world most of the time people thinking 
this is possible they know sulla did it but they think possible that it will happen again because no 
for years that anything like this could happen again sc but then once we get to forty or fifty 
then we have caesar and pompey and others and they have their armies and very ambitious ew yeah yeah 
in case the civil war that undoes the republic for effectively undoes the republic i mean the one that 
undoes the republic is war with caesar and pompey the situation is one that plays out on a bunch 
different levels caesar and pompey had been allies and caesar had commanded an army and conquered now basically france 
of switzerland all of belgium and part of the netherlands invaded britain and pulled back sc put in a 
by the way dan hardcore history i know if you know this podcast but he does a wonderful podcast 
he has six hours on campaigns in gaul which is was well worth listening to ew oh wow yeah 
so caesar does all of this with an army that is a very serious and very powerful army but 
war is probably illegal and so caesar negotiates for much of the last part of the bc to try 
figure out how he can be reincorporated into roman political life because conquering this much territory means caesar is 
wealthy he has really really good troops who are really loyal to him and he needs to figure out 
under which he can come back into roman political life and not be punished for this sc been a 
naughty but really powerful ew yeah and romans are really scared of him at least elite romans are really 
of him regular romans are really enthusiastic about him and so not a figure who easily fits in a 
structure and pompey begins working with opponents first to try to negotiate something but ultimately as a champion who 
potentially confront caesar if he needed to what ends up happening is the negotiations break down and caesar realizes 
he will probably die if he attack rome the republic protect him and whatever promises anybody is making for 
protections and legal due process and immunity those can easily be undone and no political structure that can prevent 
from happening sc so a lot of weight that goes on this so i just wanted to see how 
we are or whether this is the kind of thing caesar would have said after the fact an incredibly 
campaigner throughout what we call europe now so he has a big army like you say of really really 
soldiers and the people in power in rome itself and the establishment are afraid of him and like him 
so what is his evidence that he just go back like that the norms have been so violated or 
so fragile that even though been very successful he would his life would be in danger if he returned 
rome ew so for caesar the things that would be reassuring for him if he could go back to 
and stand for office while his army is with him okay because then protected they do anything to him 
they have to confront his army not allowed so then he says i stand for office in because if 
stands for office he be prosecuted if he stands for office in absentia he can get elected and he 
i get elected i will come back and dismiss my army before i not okay either what they sc 
that not okay ew told not okay sc and that raises his suspicions and i think that makes perfect 
ew and so what he then is sort of promised is well you can come back and you can 
for office and it will you can stand for office and if elected it would be like a month 
you take office and that should be okay but what had happened across the as the elections had been 
all the time people had organized violence to prevent elections from happening and so just because you have an 
date that you can stand in mean that election will actually happen and so i think worry is he 
go back he would be told that he could stand for election those were the terms the senate offered 
he released his army and agreed to stand for election his command over that army would lapse before he 
was elected and before he took office and then someone would prosecute him ew and so for caesar this 
like the senate is dealing in bad faith for the senate it looks like caesar is angling to try 
be in a position where he can use violence against rome if the election go his way and so 
sides i think legitimately have concerns neither one of them trusts that the republic is going to be functional 
to allow a compromise on the terms of law and precedent sc but from that telling it sounds very 
that caesar sort he would have been happy perhaps staying within the republican framework if he thought that his 
safety and wealth could be guaranteed ew yeah i think we go back to this original point of what 
republic is the republic is a mechanism that guarantees that political conflict is going to be peaceful and everybody 
enters into it into a political contest knows what win and what lose and in the context of caesar 
pompey in the senate caesar would prefer this to be a peaceful political contest when the civil war starts 
think not likely that caesar is going to win but i think calculation is if i do this and 
march back to rome i will be punished for sure and if i just stay in gaul and refuse 
march back to rome and refuse to dismiss my army pompey will assemble a massive army from all of 
other territory rome controls and destroy me sc and so in some sense the legacy of the previous hundred 
since the gracchi brothers is that when stakes get high if you lose in the political arena you die 
yeah yeah and this is the lesson that starts with tiberius gracchus the rules for political contests had been 
by the republic for over three hundred years you knew what happened if you won you knew what happened 
you lost and after tiberius gracchus you really know what would happen if you lost and you also really 
what the rules of the conflict would be what the rules of the contest would be somebody could change 
in the middle and what do you do then and no guarantee at the end that what you thought 
be the worst possible outcome is actually the worst possible outcome something much worse could happen sc so we 
the civil war and caesar ew and caesar wins sc and what happens ew caesar has to figure out 
going to do and he has a few models one model is what sulla had done sulla had marched 
rome he had won a civil war he had himself proclaimed dictator but sulla was very old and sulla 
understood that probably this gonna be a sustainable position for him so sulla reworked the roman constitution and then 
down as dictator and retired and he died a couple of years later that gonna work for caesar because 
was young and so when caesar won the civil war he just reform the republic and step down he 
going to potentially live for another fifteen years and quite possible that whatever he set up if not there 
superintend it could go south and still there to be prosecuted or punished or killed so that feasible and 
needed to figure out what sort of structure would actually work ew a monarchy rome had gotten rid of 
monarchy and so caesar played with that idea a little bit and realized that romans accept that and so 
what caesar comes up with is a structure where a dictator forever and the regular offices of the republic 
but caesar picks all the people who will have these offices and so at the time of assassination a 
of people who will hold offices for the next few years and everybody knew where they were on that 
and idea was if you have somebody who knows in three years gonna have an office they really want 
make trouble sc while they have skin in the game yeah ew yeah and so what ends up happening 
brutus and cassius end up happening sc but caesar it as if he marched in with his army and 
said the emperor right he did try to gradually work within the remnants of the republican system ew yeah 
caesar was trying to do was in effect make the republic start up again with caesar protected as dictator 
one of the things that caesar realized was there were a lot of reforms that he could institute that 
be popular and so caesar worked on this high level and then the government officials did more or less 
they did the people who regulated whether the markets were effectively weighing grain fairly they still did what they 
caesar do that sc and it was a popular system with the people of rome it as if they 
like no we want a dictator a and this is another thing where we might draw lessons for modern 
but the idea of a strong leader taking care of us was something that a lot of people bought 
ew right and the other thing is there are elections picking running but there are elections and so you 
still have elections you still have offices but just there making sure everything is working as it should and 
caesar there things sometimes work like they should and they would fix they would sort of right themselves only 
caesar showed up in rome ew but what was distasteful to people like brutus and cassius was an ideal 
liberty that they felt like they needed to restore and intriguing about this is this is political brand brutus 
coins in fiftyfour bc that say on them and they have lady liberty the personification of libertas on the 
of the coin and on the back they say his brand but brand in fiftyfour bc was liberty is 
following the laws that the people set up if the people set up and people say that this is 
and this is the policy then the policy and tyranny is people or an individual exercising power that is 
legal that the people give them sc and do we think that in i know hard to read minds 
do we think that motivations are really pretty much idealistic in a sense even when assassinating caesar ew for 
but interesting is his idea of libertas has changed libertas in fiftyfour was the laws the laws dictate how 
should run tyranny is not following the laws the laws said caesar is dictator the laws said caesar has 
power the laws all said that this structure that caesar put in place was legal and brutus then has 
say this is one man in charge and but the opposite of what tyranny was to him in and 
brutus has to make this jump that on the one hand makes complete sense and on the other hand 
no sense and ideologically an issue with what libertas is to brutus in and this is an issue that 
out after the assassination of caesar brutus kills caesar brutus expects to immediately be hailed as this champion of 
restored freedom to the romans and instead everybody panics and the whole city is sort of scared to death 
gonna come next and brutus is shocked people actually like what brutus was promising them ew it took an 
day for brutus to even deliver the speech he planned in that time people loyal to caesar had crafted 
own response so one of them who was the military commander under caesar while caesar was alive organizes the 
forces just outside of the city of rome comes and occupies part of the forum mark anthony figures out 
to work rhetorically to craft a legacy for caesar that will be popular and ultimately on the second day 
the assassination the senate has to agree to ratify all of acts when anthony comes in and says realize 
you condemn him as a tyrant like brutus wants you to all of these offices that you held under 
are illegal and all of these offices caesar promised to you that will be and so gambit of incorporating 
people by giving them stuff secures legacy he be attacked as a tyrant and brutus agrees to this because 
was one of the people who had benefited from this sc deep into shakespeare play territory now and it 
perfect sense like when you look at the history of course shakespeare would write about this because very shakespearean 
it were but yeah and so maybe we know a little bit about how things go a whole bunch 
civil wars back and forth right ew yeah sc so anthony gets an alliance does he marry cleopatra did 
ever get married or live together ew well married to sister not sure officially in roman eyes what that 
is he has children with her clear that this is the marriage this is the relationship that really matters 
him but i know for sure whether he divorces octavia or not and if so when sc okay but 
was a lot of politicking where was augustus at this time octavian at the time when being assassinated ew 
is a fascinating figure nineteen years old he appears on the list of people that caesar was going to 
an office in the future in the city of apollonia which is in albania now at the end of 
via egnatia so for those of you who are byzantine history fans this is the road this is the 
street of the byzantine empire it starts in constantinople and it runs all the way to apollonia and the 
that links thessaloniki and constantinople so the most important road across the balkans and caesar had planned once the 
season and the sailing season opened to march out with an army and go and attack now iraq and 
octavian is nineteen years old waiting for caesar to learn how to fight a war while caesar went and 
what is called parthia caesar never makes it and so octavian gets the news that caesar has died and 
octavian is heir anthony had had the will publicly read out which was a mistake anthony thought that he 
be heir sc chuckle wait sorry did he ordered that the will be read out not knowing what was 
it is that true ew apparently sc wow chuckle a mistake yeah ew idea was that the way you 
get people to fully turn on brutus was to have a public speech shakespeare does this well to have 
public speech in which you talk about what caesar did why it matters and display for them the wounds 
were inflicted on caesar and anthony does this in the reading of the will in which caesar gives money 
every roman citizen and gives parkland to every roman citizen and also announces chuckle that octavian is the heir 
think anthony had a sense of what was in there i know if he knew that octavian was named 
think he but this was part of the way that anthony turned this uncertainty about what the murder of 
meant into enthusiastic embracing of legacy but what that meant was octavian now had the possibility to claim legacy 
he was heir sc and by heir we mean he was the next emperor that a thing right but 
was the person who inherits stuff ew he inherited property but the condition was that he had to take 
now if octavian is he could use this and leverage this and build this into a really effective way 
confront the opponents of caesar and anthony the allies of caesar who potentially would be opposed to octavian but 
is he even hold office yet not eligible to be even considered for the leading offices in the roman 
he has no political experience he has really not a great deal of personal experience and assumption and even 
was probably in his best interest to not do this but if he was gonna do this probably gonna 
he last long sc so by do this we mean ew claim the legacy sc claim the legacy ew 
go and try to avenge caesar what octavian decides contrary to advice was to go and claim the legacy 
caesar and actually start using the name of caesar as a way to build a political support structure for 
and the maneuverings that octavian is able to do are amazing sc a pretty confident guy ew especially when 
consider his age but i think the other thing that is really shocking about octavian caesar did not want 
wage civil war in a way that was vicious caesar was particularly interested in pardoning adversaries he want to 
property or lives unless he needed to he had learned from what had happened in the civil wars in 
where he was one of the victims of sulla he had learned that this makes it very difficult for 
state to come back together it makes it very difficult for you to exercise authority later and much better 
wage a civil war in such a way that you rehabilitate as many people as you possibly can octavian 
think had learned from caesar that that is an excellent way to get yourself killed i think a lot 
be said about the desirability of what caesar was trying to do octavian take that chance and take that 
so octavian was vicious when he fought civil wars and i think what we see throughout history is most 
who are vicious when they fight civil wars tend to be vicious after they win as well what octavian 
able to do was to pivot and create a structure where he was in charge of the state but 
viciousness more or less ended and part of that is because he killed most of the opponents who mattered 
yeah a godfather yeah ew yeah but then part of that is he figured out ways to create a 
structure after the civil war is ended that incorporated all of the people who are meaningful in ways that 
them a stake in the success of his enterprise and made the barriers to opposing him extremely high and 
it extremely unlikely that anybody who opposed him would have any kind of positive outcome for themselves at all 
and was there any specific final tipping point where octavian then augustus became went from the chief of the 
to being the emperor ew the process is incredibly fascinating he starts out as somebody with no army and 
office just a name he comes to rome is able to leverage this into the support of some of 
who he hires or he recruits with the idea that gonna go and fight brutus and cassius he tries 
use them against anthony who has now become an enemy that work the troops refuse to fight each other 
they both are caesarean sc yeah ew he ends up getting those troops enrolled in the republican army that 
to go and confront anthony after anthony breaks with the senate in the course of that battle the two 
the senate had chosen end up dying octavian then is fully in charge of this army the senate refuses 
acknowledge this so octavian marches the army on rome and makes an alliance with anthony they then defeat brutus 
cassius and anthony and octavian fall out and over the course of the late and into the octavian manages 
maneuver things so that his position visavis anthony continually gets stronger and anthony gets increasingly marginalized until in thirtyone 
octavian forces defeat forces and then in octavian chases anthony invades egypt conquers egypt anthony dies cleopatra dies and 
becomes a roman territory the genius that octavian has when he takes egypt the structure in egypt going all 
way back to the pharaonic period was that the sovereign in charge of egypt had a huge amount of 
land ew this in the republic would have become public land that belonged to the republic but octavian takes 
as his land and what octavian then does is he adds that into all of the private property that 
had from estate and all of the property that he had confiscated from other people and he has an 
separate entirely separate ledger sheet and he ensures effectively that the public finances are almost always in deficit and 
time a crisis he bails them out using his private resources now his private resources include egypt so significant 
he makes it very clear every time this happens that he is stepping in as a private citizen and 
out the public when a problem and i think this actually is the unacknowledged tipping point this is what 
the empire work he makes soldiers loyal to him and makes sure that they are paid in a way 
they understand paying them ew whenever anything of substance seems to go wrong he makes sure that he fixes 
and he makes sure everybody understands that this comes from his private resources and so what he has done 
left the republic the public thing to function but made it clear that it functions very badly and for 
state to actually work for roman lives to actually work the private resources of augustus as he becomes are 
you have this function in any meaningful way without him present and this is the genius of how he 
from this horrible vicious civil warrior to somebody who creates an enduring political structure that exists for one thousand 
hundred years sc how long was it between the death of caesar and augustus becoming emperor ew assassinated in 
of augustus wins the civil war with anthony in thirty bc and then comes up with a political sc 
years ew about fourteen years sc fourteen years counting back oh yeah ew yeah and then comes up with 
political settlement in that will be the basis of what his power is but the historian tacitus writing in 
second century sums up i think very succinctly why this all works for so long augustus is emperor for 
years on the political scene for seventeen years before that but emperor for fortyone years the average roman lives 
fifty years tacitus writes that there a roman left who remembers the republic and right augustus dies at seventysix 
old he was nineteen when he comes on to the political scene nobody left who remembers a functional republic 
so this idea because it had previously happened in the times of the republic that be temporarily a king 
a dictator or whatever right in times of emergency or someone would claim that and then get deposed but 
so the idea that after augustus we go back to a republic had sort of dissolved just over time 
yeah nobody even when you think of left maybe of the people are over but they the were an 
time for the republic but to actually remember it and understand what was going on probably twenty years old 
that point so you have to be ninetysix to have any meaningful memory of a republic actually functioning as 
should hardly anybody like that and if you mattered you were dead someone ensured that you were dead somewhere 
when you were born and sc and also as we mentioned before with caesar augustus took power with great 
acclaim there resistance he force himself on rome maybe he did by machinations but they certainly went along with 
right ew i think that another interesting moment that happens in every imperial reign generally speaking when emperors take 
in the roman period a lot of them die very quickly that makes sense taken power if you secure 
you die but if you make it through the first couple of years many of them then last until 
twelve to fifteen years in and then another sort of spurt of them getting assassinated and then if they 
past that then they tend to live out a natural life and they reign for a very long time 
i think you look at the progression of augustus there is a major crisis around twenty bc when the 
war ended in now you have the generation that remembers the civil war is kind of passing on into 
senior positions but then the people who are rising up really remember the civil war as well and willing 
challenge him ew and when augustus manages to beat back this challenge but then he withdraws from rome and 
stops providing that money and he stops providing that security and he lets things kinda go to hell for 
little while and steps back in when asked to but what really secures power for him is this moment 
he reminds the next generation of what the republic is actually like do you really want the republic it 
mob violence it means not enough food it means disasters that afflict the city that you recover from what 
republic is sc he was truly a brilliant politician ew oh yeah and he was willing to do anything 
was necessary but he was also i think enough of a forward thinker that he could understand how to 
crises from happening before they did if they did happen he was willing to do whatever it took to 
that crisis in his favor but he was also very capable of foreseeing what crises might occur and doing 
he could to head them off five years before they might emerge sc and later on either later in 
or after him were there later flareups where people tried to restore the republic ew no sc no ew 
in a meaningful way sc because they were basically happy or because it was basically fruitless ew augustus created 
system that worked very very well and subsequent emperors used this system and they incorporate increasing numbers of people 
so when you look at the pattern of how power is allocated across the empire what you see is 
the people empowered by augustus were the people more or less of families that had gotten citizenship but had 
yet risen to the highest levels of roman offices and senatorial offices during the republic and so augustus takes 
who are powerful wealthy but to a degree outsiders and gives them the highest tier of responsibilities as you 
to the next dynasty what you see is they start expanding and bringing in people from spain and northern 
and southern france and greece and building out their loyalists with the next group of people sc sort of 
works with patronage and loyalty ew and what you do is you create these people who are incredibly loyal 
you at the expense of people whose star has kind of faded and always these moments of tension where 
quite yet reach the point where those new people are powerful enough to resist and you might die if 
happens but if you get over that hump you have a very loyal and very powerful base of support 
the next dynasty the spaniards become emperors and they start bringing in a lot more people from the greek 
to form this new core aristocracy the next dynasty is north africans and syrians and so that what augustus 
able to create was a dynamic structure that if managed well everybody who mattered could be made to have 
investment in this being stable and this is the genius of the empire is he creates a structure out 
chaos that is stable it gets people interested in it it gets people invested in its success and it 
selfsustaining in a way that the republic never really was sc it is an amazing story in many ways 
i have two questions left but both very big questions so we can decide how long to go on 
them could we be in the discussion just had accused of buying into a great man theory of history 
we could give a lot of credit to these particular figures and glanced at mentioning well there was a 
inequality in rome and there was this way of having armies that were loyal to individuals rather than the 
or were there systematic effects that would have had the same effects or the systematic forces that would have 
to the dissolution of the republic just as well even for a different cast of individual characters ew i 
this is a great question and i suppose what i would say is if we are to look at 
historical cycles i think that a great man theory of history and i think a great system theory of 
but i think a robust system can restrain any individual and a capable individual can overthrow a weak system 
think that if augustus had been born in no he would not have become emperor he would have probably 
consul he would have been very successful in working through republican channels we might know his name but really 
would have been a creature of that system because that system was strong it was robust it set rules 
really be broken and there have been any capacity for him to do what he had done if you 
scipio africanus out of that robust system of the third century bc and plunked him down in fifty bc 
he have become emperor i think he probably could have and i think he might have wanted to be 
the time in which he was living the republic was robust enough that it set the rules for political 
and you challenge them effectively and no one in their right mind who was capable would have tried sc 
think that that does make sense so my other question then is even way bigger scope told a certain 
and obvious parallels to present day events but not perfect right in many ways different how do we choose 
stories to tell about history like in our mind there is an infinite number of things we could say 
many different sources and we highlight this and we emphasize that and we ignore that how much of it 
our perspective that bringing to things how much of it can be universalized or made scientific or something like 
ew wow a wonderful question i think the short answer to that is to speak on a personal level 
please ew i am interested in the stories that help me think in a more broad way about the 
around me that mean that the world around me is the same as the world that describing or working 
radically different as we said at the outset we live in a society with slavery we see human beings 
the same way that romans did the notion so deep in roman society that humans are property is something 
is so antithetical to the very core to what our society believes that these places are radically different from 
other but roman history gives us tools to think with there are analogies we can make but there are 
just possibilities that we can entertain and it gives us a set of tools that we can use to 
what futures might be what outcomes to events could potentially be and what kinds of responses make sense or 
sense to the events around us history destiny but history does give us a sense of what could happen 
it gives us tools to think with and a lot easier i think to grasp the world around us 
we just have more information about what possible outcomes might be sc i think that is a beautiful place 
end edward watts thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast ew thank you so much music critical 
fascinating period of history especially in light of our current era nice points about the role of memory with 
to normalization of deviance look forward to picking up this book good historical perspective into politics norms and institutions 
and later venice created major institutional innovations that we are still using roman republic was not a nation state 
was a citizen state where loyalty was towards institutions nations by acemoglu and robinson frame the discussion using concepts 
institutions and extractive institutions and easy to see the change in rome rome was always under institutions that were 
inclusive and partially extractive but compared to other large states it was relatively inclusive citizen soldierlandowner was important institution 
tiberius gracchus clearly spotted a real problem and threat to rome amazing how weakly norms and institutions are embedded 
the culture short discussion with people living in a liberal democracy shows clearly that people have not not internalized 
liberal democracy or rules and laws based system somehow it has enough inertia to keep going and civil servants 
independent judiciary seem to upheld large part of it comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the worlds
