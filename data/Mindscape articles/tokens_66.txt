to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll those of you who have read my book the big picture 
remember that i talk a lot about consciousness not so much how consciousness works but the fact that it 
any mystical spooky stuff to go ahead and eventually explain it we understand the explanation yet but we have 
reason to think that get there in perfectly physical natural terms so one of the things you have to 
if an argument gonna make even though we yet have the explanation is that possible to imagine a purely 
explanation and part of that is understanding how consciousness could have arisen and of course consciousness is an incredibly 
multifaceted thing so not one simple answer there are stages along the way consciousness has many aspects from experience 
wakefulness to selfawareness one aspect is imagination our minds can conjure up multiple hypothetical futures to help us decide 
choices we should make where did that ability come from guest malcolm maciver pinpoints an important transition in the 
of consciousness to when fish first climbed on to land and could suddenly see much farther which in turn 
it advantageous to plan further in advance if this idea is true it might help us understand some of

for science and engineering click to show episode transcript sc so i talked in the big picture about an 
given by guest malcolm maciver a professor at northwestern university about one of the steps that conscious creatures might 
gone on and in particular when fish climbed onto land now obviously a lot of physiological changes when you 
from being an aquatic animal to a landbased animal but maciver claims that also intellectual changes changes in how 
think and based on the idea that how we think is strongly influenced by how we sense which is 
turn related if you want the podcast i did with lisa azizzadeh on embodied cognition where we talked about 
we think is influenced by our bodies in general here on podcast gonna be thinking about how thinking is 
by how we sense the world so whether through our eyes or our ears or in the case of 
fish they have electrical impulses that give them a handle on the world around them sc so maciver argues 
the transition of climbing onto land gave not only a different way of thinking about the world and looking 
the world but a different mode of imagination so not only could you see much further once climbed onto 
but that fact about your sensorium led directly to an evolutionary change in how you could compete for food 
other resources namely you could plan ahead suddenly there is an evolutionary pressure to develop a capacity for imagination 
is crucial on the road to consciousness so in podcast we dive into this idea we talk about how 
sense in general how we think and then the implications of this understanding for how we should think how 
can better improve our actual cognitive capacities both as individuals and as a species as societies how we can 
for the future we are stuck with the brains that evolution gave us can we do better than that 
a wonderful conversation mixing ideas from science and philosophy with real implications for how we live in the world

music sc malcolm maciver welcome to the mindscape podcast malcom maciver great to be here sc so we have 
lot of ground to cover from fish swimming around to planning for the future of humanity but a somewhat 
guy and a wonderful role model for a successful interdisciplinary career being as you are a professor in engineering 
and yet working on all sorts of things so maybe in contrast to some other people we might have 
the show why we talk a little bit about how you got here what was your academic path that 
you to where you are now mm oh okay a very tortured path i guess i first of all 
go to a formal school i was sort of selftaught eventually got myself into community college in canada and 
that to get into university and there essentially i was curious about everything and i immediately figured out if 
did a philosophy degree i could sort of get to do everything sc like everything yeah mm yeah but 
two years into my degree i started getting quite worried that i might not be able to find a 
so i added a major in computer science to my degree sc oh very smart on both counts good 
mm and something very interesting happened i started taking classes in philosophy and computer science which were talking about 
same things like turing machines and philosophy of mind and the nature of computation and that got me very 
because suddenly the thing that i thought i was doing for a bread and a meal ticket was actually 
also satisfying for me and so that sort of led to this whole line in cogsci and ai that 
pursued for a while i started a i did a masters in philosophy of science did a twoyear stint 
a fouryear program phd program in cogsci and philosophy of mind at indiana university which is actually where i 
classmates with dave chalmers and anthony tromero and some other people gone on to do really well but two 
into that i decided i was getting kinda frustrated just thinking about the nature of the mind and thinking 
the nature of computation and wanting to do something with my hands as it were and decided to reapply 
grad school and get into neuroscience and eventually led to this program at urbana university of illinois in urbana 
i did essentially neuroethology but with a strong computational bent to it sc you have to tell me what 
is mm okay so the study of the neural basis of natural behaviors it has a very long and 
maybe not ancient tradition but old tradition of essentially the marriage of ethology and neurophysiology sc i even know 
ethology is mm the study of animal behavior sc animal behavior okay mm looking at birds rolling eggs konrad 
these are famous ethologists sc i know those names i know the whole greek word ethology mm yeah yeah 
e just the letter e not ae or anything crazy like that mm ethology just ethology so those two 
got together in neuroethology and the pursuit of neuroethology is one of looking at things like predatorprey behaviors any 
of behaviors see in the natural world so rather than bringing an animal into the lab and do what 
effective for creating scientific measurements repeatability you take what you get in nature or you try to recreate it 
the lab and so a whole tradition there and what i pursued except it was a lab run by 
former highenergy physicist who was at caltech actually did a lot of work in quirks martin nelson is his 
sc so many people are former energy physicists hilarious laughter mm so as a result it was a really 
mix of both animal behavior and computational modeling and really highly quantitative neurophysiology so it was a really great 
for me sc okay and none of this is engineering mm none of this is engineering so where engineering 
in is a little the last few years of my phd i was getting more into actually we devised 
of the very first perhaps the first robot that used the same principles as a weak electric fish to 
objects sc weak electric fish are an actual kind of fish mm yeah actual kind of fish they get 
in they are real animals that essentially emit a small electric field and detect objects sort of like a 
uses sonar to detect objects so what my phd was on it was on characterizing their sensory system and 
natural behavior precapture behavior in electric fish as they hunted their favorite prey which happened in this particular species 
be water fleas and but near the end of my phd i got into building robots that duplicated some 
of their capability in this particular case it was how they use electric fields to detect objects and identify 
sc the kind of the deep the underlying theme here is trying to figure out how thinking or cognition 
to the body and the biology is there a theme mm well the theme of i guess neuroethology is 
most effective angle into understanding neural circuitry which is a lot more conserved across animals than we previously understood 
you can study a fish you can study even insects and get a lot of insight into neural organization 
general so the idea is to use behaviors which were highly selected for as levers into the circuitry that 
those behaviors and so really what electric fish as a field is sort of oriented around and the great 
about electric fish which is why my advisor and many other people with quantitative or physics or electrical engineering 
have gotten into them is that whereas with most sensory systems for example for a whole faction be very 
to give a step impulse so you really go from no odor to full odor to no odor just 
this complex mixing going on with electric fields when working on electric fish trivial to take their field add 
sinusoidal modulation or a square wave modulation and then look at what their brain is doing as a result 
you can apply all of these techniques from electrical engineering and systems analysis theory to electric fish with very 
difficulty sc how so these are real fish how big is an electric fish an adult mm the ones 
are typically studied in the lab the apteronotids are centimeters long sc okay and do is there a vibrant 
market in electric fish do you you buy them at the fish market mm well funny is that actually 
in the tropical fish market and a lot of people get them not even knowing that they are electric 
they have a bizarre body form because they most fish swim by flapping their tails these guys have undulating 
at the bottom of their bodies we call that the ventral fin and they undulate that sort of like 
curtain to move forward and backward and frequently you tell what direction swimming and they swim equally agilely in 
directions sc but not electric eel something different mm no electric eels are related actually in a close phylogenetic 
to the ones telling you about but they have evolved a much stronger electric organ which can put out 
hundred volts at an app to stun their prey and then they can have a leisurely time going around 
up the things that are stunned sc so the eel is using electricity as a weapon mm as a 
sc the electric fish is using it as its sense organ mm they also yeah and they also have 
low voltage type to do sensing with sc okay mm but the weakly electric fish only have the low 
sc so you get this electric fish you bring them to your lab and you put them in a 
and you zap them and see what happens mm yeah you depending on the experiment i did a lot 
behavior with them we also did primary afferent neurophysiology where actually modulating their electric field you take their field 
add some sort of change to it that simulates then swimming by a rock or a plant and you 
that back into the tank sc okay and so tricking them a brain in a vat a fish in 
vat mm yeah it totally is which is really remarkable you can do virtual reality with very little difficulty 
an electric fish because they are sensing electric signals which you can modulate with perfect control all over the 
sc and is that their primary input or do they also have sight and taste mm they have eyes 
blurry and cataract by the time we get them they seem to use them very much the reports are 
rivers that they hunt in are turbot so even in the day time you see more than a few 
through them sc right mm so it looks like mostly used for is it safe to come out yet 
it dim enough to come out and hunt at night they hunt at night or a time to go 
in the weeds sc right their prey are just little bugs mm exactly sc and they wanna stay away 
mm although a whole buzzing electric civilization of two hundred species and many of them will hunt sc what 
one told me this mm they will hunt other electric fish in fact many of the fish we get 
the lab have several inches of their tail missing because been nipped and they their tail is where their 
field is strongest so almost like a lure and they happen to have evolved a way to regenerate their 
cord in that area which has been a subject of much interest because vertebrates regeneration of the spinal cord 
obviously an important ability sc but an electric arms race among several different species mm yes yes it totally 
an arms race with many sc underwater almost invisible mm underwater yes the whole pulses went from a uniphasic 
biphasic to all these different modes of signaling for sexual speciation an amazing story sc do we know how 
this developed in evolutionary biology mm i think it was if memory serves it was a around one hundred 
years ago that they branched off of the nonelectric osteoglossomorphs i think it was is i should know this 
being sc we care not gonna judge you yes laughter okay so how did you hornswoggle northwestern university into 
that this is engineering somehow mm well so i came to actually here at caltech where recording and i 
with joel burdick a great roboticist here and we did really fun work now on making a robotic replica 
the locomotion system which turns out to have all kinds of fascinating properties sc the locomotion system of the 
mm of the fish so this rib and fin locomotion system which gives them bidirectional motion forward backward motion 
amazing agility and so we built a robot here several robots here that replicated parts of well the entire 
and fin essentially we had a scale model i remember this the first one we did was with wheels 
servo motors and the last one we did was quite long it was about a meter long we had 
in a flow tank in the basement of the mechanical engineering building and did a variety of fluid studies 
it sc it seems that having electric fields as your primary sense work is a weird thing in the 
kingdom mm yes sc and also having this locomotion is a weird thing amongst the underwater dwelling things is 
a relationship between these two rare effects mm yes there is a very tight relationship and so the way 
goes is these are animals which typically when hunting see them hunt backwards see them hunt forwards a great 
to hunting backwards to moving backwards while hunting in that by the time the prey or object of interest 
gotten to their mouth scanned it with their electrosensory system so because a really nearfield sense you kinda need 
drag it across the receptors of the body before you can identify so if swimming backwards really easy scanned 
by the time it gets to their head if swimming forwards what they do is they do this sort 
or something to get closer as swimming forward then do a rapid corkscrew back sort of back to get 
object if something that they want to eat sc so the relationship is that this electric sense is very 
but short range mm short range and if they were to try if they only had a big tail 
and they had to go forward and circle around they lost the prey because they so i spent much 
my phd quantifying exactly how far they can sense their objects of interest out to and for a fifteen 
fish something on the order of centimeters for a millimeter size prey so hunting these particular species that talking 
which is apteronotus albifrons are hunting or the black ghost much sexier name black ghost knife fish hunt these 
water fleas and so they can only sense those centimeters or so away and so if they were to 
forward and circle back they totally lost sc still lost game over mm yeah sc now this obvious evidence 
favor of intelligent design the fact that the fish have built this locomotive mode and the electric fields complete 
mechanism mm yes absolutely sc or do we have the evolutionary understanding of which came first mm a good 
i know if we know from the fossil record which came first i suspect because undulatory swimming is actually 
that uncommon it surprise me if that come first in fact there are these nonelectric fish like xenomystus nigri 
has a ribbon fin and they use passive electric sense but actively generate it but again passive electrosense is 
super shortrange sense and so having a ribbon fin kind of goes with that it may not be active 
dependent but it coevolved with either active or passive probably passive first i think the ancestral condition sc okay 
you worked on the locomotion aspect of the electric fish as a postdoc here at caltech and that does 
a little bit more engineeringy to me right how things move in weird circumstances mm right right right and 
what i was doing with joel is trying to figure out what roboticists called the small time reachable set 
the animal which is sc what do human beings call that mm which is essentially where you can get 
given any feasible control input so for a car you can go forward and backward initially and with some 
of your wheels you can kind of get an hour glass shape and then you can do parallel parking 
such but you can see how that shape evolves in your eye as you get more time from kind 
an hour glass shape to more of something like a circle and so i was curious what this would 
for electric fish since this is actually something that was actively being worked on by some kind of geometric 
geometry people who are interested in the problem sc so some mathematicians pushing conductor fields mm exactly exactly sc 
are interested in these fish mm yeah well they were originally doing it for carangiform the tailflapping type swimmers 
i wanted to do it for the ribbonfin swimmers and that got me into oh well this is a 
volume or as i now call it or smalltime reachable set that has this very interesting geometry at small 
scales that changes at larger time scales and it has this very interesting relationship to the sensory sensorium of 
fish sc i just want to pause here because it is kind of amazing to me the relationship between 
maybe not that surprising when i put it in these words the relationship between the motion of objects and 
and differential geometry and higher mathematics i remember vividly this wonderful little book on differential geometry by walter burke 
he gives an explanation for why people find it difficult to get an intuitive grasp of parallel parking he 
because it involves the noncommutation of vector fields mm yeah vbrackets sc yeah exactly because you have the operation 
moving forward or backward you have the operation of turning your wheels right or left and they commute it 
matters which you do first and if you understand that perfectly well it helps you parallel park mm exactly 
sc and so i can see why if you had different modes of moving the differential geometries would become 
in that mm yeah yeah sc and so that got you interested in differential geometry mm it got me 
interested in differential geometry although i pursue it too far at about that time i got multiple people emailed 
this sort of job that was opening up at northwestern that was looking for a neurobiologist also trained in 
sc i see apply mm so i cut chuckle mm i cut my postdoc about a year short just 
i was getting into the more arcane and interesting aspects of the differential geometry approach to these animals so 
it did get me interested in how to understand the relationship between sensory spaces the sensorial of the animal 
their locomotion ability which has led to many interesting avenues subsequently sc right so once at northwestern still studying 
electrical fish mm yeah sc but you it sounds like from the story that you had some initial interest 
thinking how the nervous system was working mm exactly sc then you became interested in the sort of more 
mm exactly sc locomotive aspect and then now a faculty member you can do whatever you want mm yeah 
and so you start thinking more about thinking in the nervous system mm right yeah yeah and so the 
that went was roughly speaking so the last bit of my postdoc was this paper characterizing exactly how the 
and motor volumes coordinate over different time scales and at the end of this work i decided it would 
fun to look at how visuallyguided animals underwater how they coordinated their sensory spaces with their locomotor spaces so 
sc so sorry figured out some relationship between this very special weird thing mm yeah sc this beastie electrical 
mm yes yeah sc they can sense a certain distance around it using electric fields and related to this 
locomotive thing it has mm precisely sc so you wanna okay what about the nonweird stuff what is that 
mm well right and so just to quickly summarize the electric sensory volume looks like a cylinder around their 
okay and their small time reachable set or their motor volume is essentially cylinder as well and how they 
that sc so they probably mm out of their actuator is a really interesting problem which we solved but 
go into the details but then the question is for an animal that looks forward and so now imagine 
your eye sort of a pieshaped wedge of space in front of them and then they have a tail 
system that only pushes them forward into that space into that wedge of space and they can yaw or 
left and right roughly proportional somewhat related to their the angle of that pie so pie slice and so 
was interested in characterizing how those two things coordinated in a visuallyguided animal and so we did the calculations 
some estimates and turned out that i expected i guess to see something we walk around with this giant 
volume ourselves visual sensory volume and my intuition was that that visuallyguided fish underwater would have this giant pie 
thing that they would be moving around looking for their prey and it turned out to be really pathetically 
and so small that i thought there were there was an error in the calculation sc sorry which one 
small the sensorium mm the length of the pie so how far sc which pie the sensorium pie or 
locomotion pie mm the sensorium pie sc okay mm so these visuallyguided fish hunting for small bugs see them 
far ahead and it was such a small distance ahead i thought there was a problem with the calculations 
sc so they can move very quickly mm yes sc they can get far but they see far mm 
correct and i thought this be right because in fact what matters for all of these animals is not 
static volume but the sweat volume through time so as because searching for empty space or relatively empty space 
food for live prey and it turns out the sweat volume for the electric fish was almost identical to 
pie wedge shaped sweat volume that the visuallyguided fish have sc the shape was different but the volume was 
same mm shape was different but volume was almost the same okay now electric fish have to pay for 
joule of the energy that investing in electric field whereas visuallyguided fish are parasitizing the energy so a difference 
in the bioenergetics but sc so it be a coincidence that these two very different organisms using two very 
mechanisms have evolved the same sensory volume mm it was bizarrely similar in size to me but so eventually 
nailed down that simply due to the attenuation length of light and water so it turns out that water 
a terrible medium for seeing with light sc for eyeballs yeah mm and i just i guess people who 
scuba diving and work in submarines can tell you this from their experience that suddenly things appear out of 
but you know i have that experience but so so the numbers showed really clearly and you lose a 
amount of information on the order of meters and imperfectly like laboratory clear water not a function of turbidity 
if you add any particles in the water then your range really goes down to nothing so that led 
i was at that time getting interested in what happened to vertebrates at the waterland transition in the upper 
why did fish evolve limbs and all the other things they needed to evolve to come up on the 
you know what was the basis of that mm and it occurred to me that vision must have changed 
after the waterland transition because suddenly going from a medium which is like a huge thick blanket on your 
to essentially infinity you can see a distance further than is in most cases behaviorally useful chuckle sc we 
see the moon right not that hard mm yeah you can see the moon yeah sc obviously a shock 
not going to hunt for prey on the moon chuckle sc right so what are you gonna do with 
knowledge mm so what i was curious about was the eyes of the ancestral aquatic vertebrates were pretty small 
i expected that they got as big as would be useful in this highly attenuating medium and you can 
it out and done that and they are about as big as they should be sc the eyes of 
fish mm yeah because getting them bigger essentially your visual range is proportional to your eye size sc the 
of a whale really big mm i know the size of the eyes of a whale they usually use 
echolocation systems for range the attenuation length of sound in water is similar to the attenuation length of light 
air and so whales and dolphins are a really interesting example of vertebrates that got used to giant visual 
doing the one thing that you could do in water to regain that kind of range sc very interesting 
mm which is use the high frequency sound production system that land animals evolved and do it for imaging 
since i know nothing about this are there underwater animals that use like a location that are not former 
animals mm not to my knowledge there may be one or two species of these teleosts that use clicks 
on remembering the species but i think there might be a couple other examples now teleosts are very recently 
animals so there might be that case sc but anyway the ancestors of dolphins and whales who got used 
this luxurious broad sensorium of seeing the whole world and they somehow cleverly figured out how to reproduce it 
mm exactly yeah and so now you asked me a long time ago about how does this connect to 
and very interested in the relationship between how far away you can sense objects and how you modulate your 
so the intuition there is just think of yourself driving rapidly too rapidly down a foggy road and you 
something suddenly you have a lot of executive planning gonna go into deciding what to do next gonna swerve 
break but in any case gonna do something simple and so my thought was that it would be central 
the evolution of more complex cognition to be able to sense things far enough out where it makes sense 
actually have a plan and the whole reason i was driven to do a whole bunch of analysis of 
happened to vision once we had gone onto land was an interest in why it is that vertebrate brains 
a lot more complex substantially more complex once we came up on land sc so the idea is that 
water you might imagine from our very parochial air landbased point of view that thinking ahead of time is 
a very useful skill to have but it also has costs right mm yes sc energy and volume in 
brains and so forth then saying that for a fish it just help no point to planning ahead too 
mm you can do it and they do do it to some extent it is just that much much 
useful once you come up on land and energetically a gift as soon as you bend that cornea that 
inappropriate after you came out of the water you need to bend it a little bit for the different 
index but as soon as you fix that which can be done very rapidly evolutionarily speaking you now can 
hundreds of body lengths away and suddenly you go from an animal which was trapped in kind of a 
bubble sort of always driving in the fog if you will to an animal which may not have had 
neural circuitry initially for anything other than reactive control to an animal which with the right mutations might be 
to stall the issuing of motor commands to the motor system and movement towards the prey to think about 
i do option a the prey will run away but if i do option b the prey run away 
maybe do option sc but wait a minute a fraught set of words that using here right chuckle not 
planning ahead also using some sort of imagination mm absolutely sc some sort of ability to simultaneously contemplate different 
scenarios in your head mm yes yes sc and so saying that the thing that prodded evolution to develop 
capability was climbing up on to the air onto land mm correct yes and so we now know the 
of that system in the brain the hippocampus in coordination with the frontal lobes that you can actually now 
animals thinking ahead thinking about different paths when they are given a challenging situation sc by putting them in 
machines or something mm well actually the studies thinking of right now are ones on called trial and error 
and those studies such as out of lab at the university of minnesota were done with electrodes in the 
sc okay mm looking at plate cell activity in the hippocampus plate cells in the hippocampus essentially are activated 
to where you are in space and what they observed is in mazes where there was not a reliable 
location where switch it so the animal had to think about what to do next then at choice points 
can actually see the plate cells racing down one arm of the maze or the other arm of the 
before they act sc wow mm so pausing there and thinking about different futures sc and were these parts 
the brain there in the fish and adapted mm no so there is a part of the dorsal pallium 
this is an area of increasing interest to me certain not one to say that suddenly we had it 
had to be precursors of course and fish have plate cells or have a sense of home i should 
they have a sense of where they are in space they have spatial maps they have cognitive maps in 
brain so certainly they have some of the primitive infrastructure for this but to do planning to do imagination 
we know of a fish being able to do this and that part of the brain the hippocampus and 
course frontal areas in mammals got much much larger with land animals sc right i mean i do know 
work that at least claims from the fmri studies that the part of the brain that lights up when 
ask someone in an fmri machine to imagine a future circumstance is the same part roughly speaking as when 
ask them to conjure up a memory of a past circumstance so it seems to be a bit of 
existing circuitry for that kind of thing mm yeah yeah well that sort right that discussion comes up in 
analyses of how our parochial thought about memory is not quite right not like a random access store more 
a recipe which once you recreate the experiences in your sensory cortices you sort of regenerate the experience where 
comes up but this is something a little bit different this the hippocampus is a very very special whole 
structure that binds information across different modalities and does relationships really well and that is where this at least 
one core part of the imagination circuit sc well always the problem we use words that were invented hundreds 
years ago like imagination and of course they have different aspects going on in the brain mm yeah exactly 
but you pinpoint this particular one and you think you so a hypothesis mm yes sc that that the 
of this to do this hypothesizing and future planning is related to this transition from sea to land mm 
right so we did this analysis of what happened to vision from after the emergence from water to land 
did we had a hypothesis about what happened to the eyes it turns out our initial hypothesis is wrong 
thought the eyes would blow up in size after we came up on the land and it was much 
interesting because we saw a blow up in eye size about ten million years before we came up on 
land sc in the fossil record mm in the fossil record and it turns out at the very same 
skull morphologies disclose that animals had these flattened skull shapes with these orbits way on top of the skull 
and they look all the for like crocodiles what would they have been doing well it turns out this 
bloom of invertebrate life on land at that point fifty million years preceding the vertebrate water to land transition 
so the bugs and the plants were already up there mm exactly so what we can then say is 
in the past we always thought of if you were to ask the most useful body part for bringing 
up on to land you would have said and everybody thought about the limbs and how did the digits 
and how do they separate well it turns out that the eye increase preceded that stuff like the separation 
digits and all that stuff was preceded by a big increase in eye size so it looks like what 
have happened something more causally interesting which is that eye size grew up and showed all this bounty that 
it worth while clambering up on the land for and only after that point do you start to see 
like rib cages and all these other things that you need to live on land with and digits separated 
all that came after the increase in eye size sc so some fish were lucky enough to realize that 
they poke their eyes up above the water they could see much further mm yeah yeah sc and they 
a tiny mm yes sc epsilon advantage mm yes sc and therefore their mm yes sc whose eyes were 
capable mm we have a theory about that too there are these breathing holes that are now eustachian tubes 
were right behind the eyes and we were going through a very low oxygen period of the sc in 
history mm in the history right at that point and so we think the animals were actually chuckle coming 
for a breath of air sc oh okay mm and just coincidentally would catch us sc they realized my 
mm yeah my goodness this bounty of unexploited food undefended and we were so excited that we actually started 
the the fossil records of the insects at the time and you can see evidence for chemical defense systems 
appearing in the fossil record about the time that the vertebrates came up on the land sc chemical defense 
from the bugs mm so little ozopores and millipedes have these chemical defense systems which currently are active against 
predators and they just pop up in the the fossil organ sc so they need defense before the vertebrates 
part of that i guess millipedes like eating other millipedes not really sc yeah okay mm but all the 
bugs that were there apparently not a system that was needed before that part of time sc okay so 
fish had this evolutionary advantage some of them figured this out mm yeah yeah sc and there was this 
pathway that opened up that there was yet another evolutionary advantage i can plan for the mm right so 
thought is that and now doing all these computational simulations and almost ready to submit a manuscript that basically 
that if you have a small range small sensory range and this is not exactly mindblowing stuff you would 
it but if you have a small range planning is useless chuckle sc yep mm if you have a 
range planning becomes progressively more useful sc i know plenty of people who have a small range and not 
good at planning so that makes perfect sense mm what was fascinating is after we did those initial simulations 
were all in openworld scenario so no clutter is that we got to this plateau sc so this is 
simulation mm yeah simulation or predator or prey sc so you do like a computer model mm yeah so 
have a predator and a prey and using markout decision processes to model the sort of the game between 
predator and prey and the prey has a thick sensory range the predator has an infinite range anyway we 
to a certain point where we said know this very landlike and getting survivability rates for our prey that 
really quite low and it seems like they ought to do a bit better why we try putting clutter 
the space because what land gives you is lots of clutter lots of sc not fun to play hideandseek 
an empty room mm exactly yeah so we tried that and we saw a fascinating pattern which was planning 
much much more useful but only in a restricted range of clutter which matches terrestrial typical terrestrial ranges so 
open space not very much advantage for planning total clutter where all you see is jungle and forest also 
very useful for planning but this sweet spot midlevel entropy if you actually calculate the entropy level of the 
space of the clutter at midlevel entropies you get this beautiful increase in the advantage of planning sc and 
much more complex structure there in the space of possibilities and so now a payoff mm exactly so now 
we see is that every time the prey moves the value of that move and the location of that 
is highly contingent on the location because if an obstacle in front of it got one value and if 
territory where the predator can just lunge then got a totally different value and so this diversity of values 
appear once you have clutter is really what is exploited by planning sc do you have any idea whether 
not the first fish to come upon to land did so in moderately cluttered environments mm well so lots 
good data now that forest systems were going at that time sc plausible anyway mm plausible yes for sure 
think that a convincing case that once on land in the right circumstances planning in some vague sense is 
is it obvious that evolution had the wherewithall to take advantage of this new opportunity sc so clearly the 
that it did mm right so chuckle well you know sc we knew mm and so do mammals many 
mammals and so do a very strong behavioral evidence that many birds as well the neurophysiology is lagging in 
group of animals so there no question of it sc we do plan we do imagine the future mm 
do imagine futures sc some of us better than others but yes mm exactly and so part of this 
the archeology of that how did it occur why did it and interested in that question from multiple angles 
is that like to know why are we so bad at planning where tight spacial and temporal limits to 
ability to plan it seems very very constrained and escaping those constraints might be incredibly useful or transcending them 
be incredibly useful in contexts such as looming threats that are transgenerational like climate change or possibly ai might 
another but in any case threats where action has to be regulated behavior has to be regulated across time 
that are much longer than what we are natively comfortable with our planning systems sc would you go so 
as to relate this emergence of the imagination if you wanna be slightly more sensationalist about it mm yeah 
perfect word for it sc to consciousness mm yeah so i think that from my standpoint the most productive 
of thinking of consciousness currently sc what is in terms of imagination mm in terms of imagination so the 
animal that had to examine its mental furniture in order to derive a useful behavioral program the first animal 
had to imagine sc so wait linking we were previously talking about planning in terms of i could hide 
the tree or i could climb on the rock etcetera mm correct yes sc but now a bit of 
is that a necessary part of thing mm well it seems kind of ineluctably connected in that it is 
your brain that you are examining these futures sc part of the future mm and part of that future 
course not everything that people want from the word consciousness but i think scientifically speaking at least for me 
is crucial is having something that is actionable scientifically chuckle and from that standpoint the idea that at least 
core component here of what we mean by consciousness is this space of imagination that opens up for purely 
very easily now we can show in the simulations why it rises or why it would arise that a 
natural response to a challenge that is brought by the interaction of longrange sensing visual sensing with this dynamic 
where memory is not quite sufficient where you need to take into account moment by moment positions of your 
and act accordingly so having that ecological scenario drives animals to evolve this system where they examine the contents 
their own thoughts sc i think that if we conjured up your former classmate david chalmers was here he 
cast the hard problem of consciousness in terms of what it is like to feel something ineluctably first subjective 
is that what addressing here or are you sort of slightly past that into a bit more objectively measurable 
this is not that aspect of consciousness sc okay still in the realm what david would call the easy 
of consciousness mm yes sc which everyone agrees is hard chuckle mm yes yes sc okay very good mm 
in fact as you know and probably spoke of this as in many other context at least that an 
of that which seems completely outside of the capability of science because science is supposed to be intersubjective then 
this is something that has to be subjective then it so therefore the ontology has to grow etcetera and 
yeah but way beyond what talking about talking about something very practical which is the space of imagination where 
would ourselves figure in that imagination and so the first moment at which our cells became well an item 
thought sc right now selfawareness is clearly an important aspect of definition of consciousness and so what getting at 
yeah sc and so i have to ask the obvious question sure everyone asks what about the octopus octopus 
climbed up on the land did it mm i just recently wrote a proposal to look at these guys 
so we should say octopuses are really really smart chuckle in some sense mm so everybody who looks at 
carefully has told me go so fast with because of course you hear things about them looking at people 
jars and then going and doing the same but heard from the same people who have done a lot 
work on them that able to do it once and then they ever do it again sc they remember 
to do it mm well or that it was actually they got lucky or something like this not denying 
it looks like they do sc you can say octopus laughter very prejudiced against octopuses mm such a thorn 
my side as soft as they are no i think something very interesting going on there and a couple 
thoughts one octopus are this nudibranch mollusks meaning unshelled meaning unarmored and yet this delicious protein that swim very 
and hunted by the animals with the greatest sensory range in the water which are dolphins and whales which 
turned their sound production systems into these amazing longrange sonar systems so they have had to survive by their 
and furthermore hunted by i just learned from roger handland done a lot of work on them that preyed 
by diving birds who are also extremely intelligent animals and can see very long distances from above and they 
hang out in shallow areas and these birds dive and hunt them sc so hard out here for an 
is what saying mm so really hard living as an octopus they have great escape mechanisms great food so 
and this seems terribly ad hoc so i immediately grant that this may just be a completely different way 
evolve cognition than with the land vertebrates have done but it is interesting that they are preyed upon by 
of the smartest vertebrates and it is interesting that they have these tremendous eyes although i would argue because 
is so useless for the most part at least as a longrange sense in water that vision is giving 
things like acuity for manipulation and that sort of thing sc and not very good well i say not 
good at but the design of the octopus brain as it were is utterly different right than mm totally 
yeah sc spread out all throughout their body mm but not so birds also have a very very different 
for their brain but they also seem to have something like a hippocampuslike structure and a part of the 
brain that people have identified as being possibly hippocampal in nature one thing that seems to be the case 
that nature is very good at evolving the correct solution regardless of the starting point so if you need 
hippocampallike structure then if you started off as invertebratestock come up with it if what you need sc okay 
get back we did the octopus got that out of the way octopuslovers out there i get it mm 
that was a totally satisfying answer sc i know that look there are people i know who are very 
ethical people who eat octopus because it has a certain level of intelligence these are very good questions not 
in any direction about them i have an idea of what the right thing to think is a very 
about this mm hoping to find out sc good good have you back when you find out be important 
okay so back to the vertebrates where we live mm yes sc so you have this hypothesis and the 
about the relationship between imagination and climbing up on the land so some evidence in the fossil record that 
evolution of eyes did what you might expect it to do under this scenario mm exactly sc is there 
one way or the other for the evolution of brains doing what expect them to do mm well tricky 
they fossilize and so what we can do is you can do things like look at commonality between the 
that is hippocampallike in birds and in mammals and their last common ancestor lived about fifty million years after 
water to land transition sc okay so not great mm so a big argument was it parallel evolution was 
convergent evolution but yeah so really hard to know how far back that goes from the fossil record background 
sc right because what we get actual fossil records the best we can do is look at the different 
that are alive today and try to roughly map them mm exactly yeah sc very hard hard just the 
of life and you can think about the simplest organisms that live now and you might think well closer 
what life like when it started but still billions of years away mm well not only that so one 
the places we can look is at the pallium which is the structure that is thought to be ancestral 
hippocampus dorsal pallium in particular and part of that and we can look at it in teleost fish and 
have collegues of mine done this and have found evidence for things like spacial maps there and so on 
so forth tricky thing there is that our last common ancestor with those animals was hundreds of millions of 
ago and so been busy evolving potentially novel structures more complicated and unique in their own ways so you 
to be careful about comparisons of extant creatures to get after reverse engineer or back calculate what happened long 
ago so not to say it be eventually possible increasingly this realm of sort of recovering soft body structure 
essentially scanning imaging fossils that were really well preserved and people are starting to be able to see neural 
that way and so maybe eventually be able to tell more mm hippocampus is pretty deep in there so 
least for that structure i have to be a bit skeptical sc yeah but nevertheless gonna fearlessly draw conclusions 
this line of use made for human beings mm totally in favor yes yes yes sc and so there 
the thought that if this story is right whether or not right a fact that our much beloved and 
ability to plan and think and be conscious is relying upon in our brains and if it did come 
does not have teleology it aim toward the future it just responds to the moment and does this story 
how we got here have lessons for where we are now mm yes and i think the answer to 
is yes and so where the research is going right now is clearly we have some capacity to plan 
the future but it seems to be both spatially limited as in we think about spaces very far away 
us not thinking right now about a trail in africa i might go on in a few hours and 
think about things very far way in time either we might stretch ourselves to think about our retirement but 
very often chuckle sc not even very good at that yeah mm pretty bad at that and then what 
we gonna do about problems that are multigenerational such as climate change and so very interested in what the 
mechanisms are for setting the length of our planning horizon and some very interesting work going on right now 
that and hoping to contribute to that i recently got an award from the nsf to look at this 
mice with dan dom back at northwestern where gonna essentially study planning in rodents and giving them a whole 
of challenging environments including predatorprey context and start to look at what sets the time base of the horizon 
is it we extend it to days or to weeks or to months or is it something that anything 
a few minutes is purely through cultural technology such sc well okay so the idea is that the fish 
from evolution plans seconds in advance and once you climb onto land now at least minutes makes sense mm 
at least minutes sc the time that it takes between when you see the mm possibly tens to minutes 
right okay but clearly human beings can do a little bit better and maybe dogs and cats now that 
about it not even clear that my cats can do seconds in advance but how can we so maybe 
first question is why can we even do that mm well right i think that we can do better 
that is interesting and the way in which we can do it as in call it how much we 
about the things we think about far in the future or far in time i think is very telling 
from that perspective peter singer has this great analogy sure heard it pond this thought experiment of driving just 
a five thousand dollars suit driving by a pond you see a struggling child in the pond what do 
do well of course you get out of your car and you run into the water destroy your suit 
his question is you send the five thousand dollars to save a child whose life would clearly be saved 
that five thousand dollars who lives in and my answer to that would be you have a very carefully 
system between your care system your planning horizon and it all sort of meshes but it meshes in a 
local sc and that makes sense in terms of evolution why do mm precisely and so getting beyond that 
think is a hard bargain at least in terms of getting it natively with circuitry so we can think 
cultural technology to do it but be nice to identify at least constraining us in terms of biological mechanism 
if we wanted to in the future or in the scifi future to be able to go in with 
or some sort of neuroprosthetic which would extend our planning horizon that we could do so right now we 
enough about it to know how we do it sc are there even other animal species that do manifestly 
weeks in advance mm depends so there are animals that cache etcetera so it depends so some of this 
be sort of assimilated to instinctual behaviors that are genetically hard programmed and so clear that the animal has 
explicit representation of this occurring and just interfering with the routines very easy to throw them off and they 
repeat but so i think squirrels and birds and other mammals have seemed to represent planning at least on 
order of days if not weeks for caching purposes beyond that i think it gets really fuzzy because of 
issue of it be just genetically sc right but so for humans it make sense to i know this 
just too simplistic but i have this idea that there was a phase transition when we the ability to 
ourselves abstractly and in language and communally that gave us a and maybe this is what you mean by 
cultural artifacts but even just individually i think that this gives us an ability to conceptualize the future that 
hardwired mm absolutely it does but my suspicion is that the gap between that kind of rationality and or 
local care system where our native planning horizons mesh with care where motivation also has a seat is kind 
the thing that we need to really crack in order to motivate ourselves to regulate behavior to affect time 
far outside of our natural range so in other words so a looming existential threat that might be multigenerational 
scope how do you motivate yourself now to do x y z and obviously we could have something like 
climate change panels that are telling us we need to do this now and governments be if responsible will 
that in imposing like carbon taxes etcetera but on a personal motivational level i guess where that gap can 
to really affect us between the natural care system and the cognitive system that a bunch of people discussing 
can say we need to now reduce our carbon footprint by this amount or sc right i do think 
there is this maybe a little parenthetical and offtrack but okay why here a question of how much you 
care about things in the future or things that are far away mm exactly yes sc i had tyler 
on the podcast and i called him he happy that i called him this but i called him the 
version of peter singer mm yes i listened to that sc because he was advocating that we have essentially 
zero discount rate for caring about the future rate he had certain policy recommendations that followed from that that 
can disagree with but interesting philosophy question should we care about people far away and people in the future 
as much as our near neighbors and our current selves mm so the normative question of how we discount 
future and then there is the empirical and empirically we are hyperbolic discounters so we essentially sc so explain 
that means mm well so the value of a future harm or benefit rapidly declines with distance from the 
and the function that describes that decline is hyperbolic sc one over x mm so cowen and others others 
have discussed this in the literature think that this discount rate is inimical to our future laughter survival and 
think correct sc if you care that much about people far away mm then you act the way we 
know sc live in the moment mm which is living for the moment and our future generations and possibly 
next generation be damned and deeply problematic and one could ask is humanity worth surviving another level up but 
you care about sc we can grant that for the purposes of this conversation mm okay chuckle sc humanity 
descendants would be a good thing to have around mm the prooctopus person would say humanity be damned sc 
met people who think that better not to have humanity around in all seriousness mm yes chuckle sc but 
gonna invite them onto the podcast some bridges not gonna cross yes but i just think that just putting 
out there maybe said it before in the podcast i do think that sympathetic to the idea that we 
care more than we empirically do about people far away and people in the future but not sympathetic to 
idea that we should care about everyone equally no matter where they are when they are i think that 
of mathematically ill defined to do that and i think that a practicality issue mm yeah there is sc 
have any five thousand dollars suits but i certainly am not giving away all of my worldly goods in 
way that we best benefit mankind and i think that kind of impractical to imagine people doing that there 
something to be said for balancing being good to the world and being good to yourself mm i fully 
and in fact gonna forget the name of the philosopher canadian written this paper on the paradoxes that arise 
zero discounting and there are many sc yeah not really practical mm not practical in many of the same 
that peter approach so being the temporal version has inherits it seems some of the same paradoxes that the 
version that peter singer pushes sc but i get it as limiting concepts reminding us how far away we 
from that ideal very useful to talk about these things mm yeah i think if we even went of 
way we would do much much better than we are sc okay so how can we get people to 
is the practical inspiration of what doing you wanna get people to be better at taking the future seriously 
exactly so my initial thought was maybe if i could really quickly figure out what was going on in 
brain to support the horizon we have i could just invent a prosthetic that everybody would put on and 
be taking their recycling out sc or a pill mm or a pill i subsequently decided that neuroscience proceeds 
slowly chuckle sc the world will be degrees mm that was my naive optimistic self ten years ago and 
now now the leading people say we have a decade to two decades to really do something or else 
i believe correct so been pursuing cultural technology to try to address the problem and it was inspired by 
book called myth of the rational by caplan and in that book he talks about the concept of rational 
the irrational rationality is that if the belief if false belief the cost of false belief is low then 
have irrationality so sort of an economist take on epistemology lowcost highirrationality and so that got me thinking well 
can we make something that is outside of our perceptual bound outside of our sensory envelope that we really 
to care about how can we make it real how can we give get what is sometimes referred to 
skininthegame for something like that mm and so myself and a couple collaborators moran cerf at northwestern have been 
a study which we just completed a little over one hundred fifty people participated half of them were climate 
and half of them were believers in climate change where we had them play a climate prediction market that 
created so there are bets over a period of thirty days on things like california have more wildfires in 
coming month than they did a year ago at the same and whole bunch of things like that and 
got twenty dollars of money to play this market and if they do really well they could potentially earn 
decent amount from the study and so we just finished it actually weeks ago collected got all the data 
up and i wait to get back to analyze it a number of things excited about one is that 
do think that this issue of how much in the next thirty days can you say is actually due 
climate change and so on and so sc sure one of many questions right mm however there are other 
that lead me to think that this could be successful regardless of whether or not a problem for example 
a result of this sports betting been a lot of research on what effect has sport betting have on 
and the clear it more than triples participation now causality there is unclear right so if a sports buff 
perhaps gonna gonna both bet and watch three times more nfl games which is what the data show but 
seems to be huge engagement effect once you bet money on something happening on an outcome you get engaged 
just like people to get engaged with climate information so one of the questions we asked in our survey 
and poststudy survey is many climaterelated stories did you attend to in your media scape before and after the 
like to see whether engagement effect which could be quite different from whether or not you get skininthegame effects 
i recently came across a study or it was not that but similar and i actually found another podcast 
lam has a hiphi podcast hi phi for philosophy and so he quotes the study i think by bullock 
the reference and put it on the website this very wellknown difference in beliefs about certain factual things between 
and republicans or conservatives and liberals like the budget deficit go up or down during the clinton a fact 
knows a number what do you think the number is and a gap and they said they give the 
to some people and they see what the gap is and then they give the survey to another bunch 
people and they say give you a dollar if you get the answer laughter and suddenly the gap goes 
basically mm yes yes yes sc so people are much an expressive component to giving opinions about things like 
even when facts and when you actually put the skininthegame charging them a dollar then more likely to get 
mm well probably aware of this so hanson who came well one of the people who came up with 
sc robin hanson mm robin hanson at george mason has tons of examples of this where it seems to 
a trivial amount of money to actually close that gap so almost like unlinked from the monetary value just 
fact that you have any actually causes a huge change in your epistemology sc yeah no familiar with this 
playing poker because poker is the most boring game in the world if not playing for money mm yeah 
sc people act rational like all right do play for a couple of pennies and like i mm well 
fabulous metaphor for position on climate change sc right yeah so okay so i can see how putting a 
bit of skininthegame makes people act a little bit more rationally how do we implement that to save the 
mm well so the idea would be if we could say universalize such a market suppose this tiny tax 
tax and it goes to people being able to play on this prediction market have a huge number of 
effects one effect would be that you get with some of the crowd effects so a whole bunch of 
happening to the climate right now that a very very small subset of which are being attended to by 
things like for example ice roads in alaska having to close much earlier than normal things like my friend 
garden has been overtaken by this invasive species that likes warmer climates sc the whole wine industry is changing 
mm either sc making champagne in britain mm that so all of these you can create these positions on 
market and now it becomes an instrument by which we can see what climate change effects are occurring and 
becomes a prosthetic if you will for understanding what changes are occurring over what time scale and that the 
might be a means by which we attune our behaviors to longer temporal sort of sc sort of imagining 
forcing people to play in this market or bribing them to do it mm well i suppose i thought 
far in advance but if one could universalize the market and have a small amount of a carbon tax 
to pocket and they could either just leave it there as sort of direct profit or they could play 
market and possibly amplify based on their knowledge then the people who want to play the market will do 
and those who sc i mean it relies on the idea that in some sense we have the cognitive 
to plan far in the future and get it right but there are shortcuts that we often take that 
us from doing mm precisely right that i feel we need to bring it we need to bring these 
slowly looming phenomena be the climate change or a future in ai we need to bring it into the 
range our native planning range sc right mm and the mechanism for that would be to change the cost 
to make it costly not to sc right we just need change the incentive structure mm that yeah change 
incentive structure but in a way that we can get our arms around spatial temporally speaking and i feel 
a prediction market would be one way probably just one of many ways just the first one that we 
was worth testing but there are other approaches and the principal is basically get skin in the game as 
your skin now during your life for something that might otherwise take very very long a very very long 
sc climate change is the obvious example of our failure to think on long horizons but my favorite example 
actually solar flares i know if very familiar with this idea mm heard you talk about this sc yeah 
i had a lunch with a lawyer who was on some committee to look at this not a scientist 
an engineer but he got the expert testimony and the claim which still not sure i really dug into 
evidence for myself but the claim was solar flares happen all the time but really big ones are rare 
sure how rare we have not been collecting data for solar flares for that long it is absolutely possible 
on time scales of once per every thousand years we get a solar flare that will be big enough 
essentially wipe out the entire power grid of the earth and millions and millions of people would mm yes 
because be without power for months or something like that right mm yes sc and not that costly compared 
the downside to harden the grid mm i see sc and save that from this mm i see sc 
no one is gonna pay the money to do that when you say a one in a thousand chance 
year that this could happen chuckle mm yes yes sc you just do that calculation not good at it 
yeah it needs to have happened at least once in the modern period sc yeah so nothing in evolution 
trains you to plan on time scales ten times longer than a human life time for obvious reasons mm 
i wonder if maybe a good of the movie sc i think that things like that are because scare 
a little bit is useful if a good scare like the china syndrome was kinda silly laughter sc and 
was kinda silly for different reasons but yes we can apply art and culture to that mm yeah sc 
reminds me end the podcast because people need to know this you are the science advisor on a very 
culturally important tv show laughter mm caprica sc caprica right which was the follow up to mm yes not 
if it falls into all of those categories but yes that was a great experience being able to go 
every script and be a part of that show sc do you think that there is or how much 
do you think there is in scientists engaging in that kind of engagement with popular culture not outreach in 
sense that not learning neuroscience from watching caprica right mm right sc but maybe by nudging the script in 
ways inspiring people what is your thought about that mm yeah i think that lots of ways in which 
enriches these shows and in the script writers necessarily welltrained in science typically and so when they are thinking 
how do i portray this ai breakthrough or this roboticist gonna take off things from the show which are 
things that they saw in movies and stereotypes that they have from pop culture actually and track with what 
a much more interesting and finegrain sort of thing going on in reality and so what able to do 
sort of add some nuance there and but also the great thing about caprica is that it had lots 
interesting philosophical aspects to this whole going into vr and the concept of i remember talking with the show 
for a long time about how do we have death in vr and that was a really fascinating problem 
puzzle over and eventually decided on something like a game that you got kicked out of once you died 
yeah it was a video game really mm and it was a really important game because in the context 
the show a one game in which this person could see their daughter who died and now lives in 
virtual reality and so getting kicked out of show really meant something very meaningful right sc and did the 
flow the other way did working on caprica in any way influenced you to think deeply about the looming 
menace the robot takeover laughter mm well i think that battlestar galactica and caprica did an amazing job of 
this whole arc right and these beautiful moments of battle star for example where the one of the cylon 
name is boomer says know not sure humanity has a right to continue and just pushes on a challenge 
us sc it is a good little challenge for us right mm it is a good little challenge and 
feel like the way they envisaged the stars that have moral prospects with ai was a fascinating and deeply 
one so yes sc well we do hope that your work and the work of others that we had 
the podcast will help stave off the cylon from taking over at some point laughter sc malcom maciver thanks
