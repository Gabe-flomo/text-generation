podcast your host sean carroll and today going to be talking about an interesting take on ethics and morality 
a societal or even global level but not talking with a philosopher talking with economist tyler cowen tyler is 
known among people who read the internet he is an accomplished economist and author also the host of his 
podcast called conversations with tyler but perhaps if you are an internet person you know him best for his 
successful blog marginal revolution that he runs with his colleague at george mason university alex tabarrok sc tyler has 
very distinctive style on the blog pithy and provocative and he specializes in turning an eye to a wide 
of issues from things like global trade that you would expect economists to write about to how to enjoy 
or read books or what to order in a restaurant when you go to visit a foreign city this 
of perspective is very very useful and tyler now turns his perspective in a new book called stubborn attachments 
the question of how we should act as a society so as to be good consequentialists not a firm 
when it comes to morality some of you may know that two great competing schools of morality or ethics 
consequentialism that says some act that you do and whether your act is moral or not depends on what 
consequences are sc typically kind of a utilitarian you want to increase the greatest good for the greatest number 
some other measure of utility aggregated over people as opposed to deontologists who have rules that they follow and 
the consequences that matter the rules themselves so in his new book tyler says a good consequentialist and you 
sort of increase the greatest good for the greatest number not just people today that matter future generations that 
just as much and so if you believe that as an arguable assumption of course you could typically discount 
future generations you know as much about them but he says no good reason to do sc and if 
then what we know from empirical studies is that if you have economic growth now then eventually everybody benefits 
growth now benefit everybody today unequally spread in its benefits but ultimately if the whole society is doing better 
then generally almost everyone gets better off and therefore if you care about future generations the moral thing to 
is to work to increase economic growth today sc now you can argue with this and of course not 
that naive if you concentrate on short term economic growth and destroy the planet then you increased utility so 
have to be careful about those kinds of risks that be taking and so these are the issues that 
talking about on the podcast today in a very wideranging conversation sc i do want to apologize a little 
both to listeners and to tyler because i mixed up the date when we were supposed to have our 
as a result i was less prepared than usual and we also had tech problems we use zencastr which 
usually use use skype so the audio quality is not what it could be so tyler was great the 
is extremely useful but i quite ready myself to dig in as deeply as i would really like nevertheless 
still just compared to what i wanted it to be the conversation turned out great overall a lot of 
for thought you may or may not agree with it but it does what good sort of thought experiment 
economics and so forth should do it pushes your brain in directions that it might not usually go and 
detour at the end of the conversation into the many worlds of interpretation of quantum mechanics which sure everyone 
like so with that in mind go music sc tyler cowen welcome to the mindscape podcast tyler cowen thank 
for having me sc so i wanted to start with sort of a higher level meta question an economist 
course but not just that written some books about how to think like an economist how to order lunch 
an economist how important is that being an economist to how you think about yourself tc well a lens 
which you see the entire world so i think in general too many academics they segregate their research from 
lives and they treat them as two separate things but if gonna do economics or philosophy or political science 
wanna realize you should live what you preach in some sense so i think been an important part of 
tried to do in my life sc so what does it mean that in your mind to think like 
economist or to live your life like an economist tc that when you see a situation you try to 
why did this come about is this the result of some kind of more generalizable model you ask what 
are the preferences and the constraints what are the incentives facing the individuals just some very basic categories you 
applying you throw them at the problem so you go to restaurants whenever they have only three dishes on 
menu the food is really good and you wonder why might that thinking like an economist sc well that 
more or less the kind of answer expect you to give and i think interesting because probably if you 
to people on the street and ask them what how economists think you would hear words like money and 
and budgets and none of those words appeared in what you just said tc money is only one thing 
people value we also value respect recognition love friendship so a typical economic question if sitting in a movie 
bored should you walk out because already paid for the ticket not getting that money back a sunk cost 
basically you should go sc so basically economics is a way of being a rational person sort of fulfilling 
desires in terms of your maximizing your actions to get whatever incentives whatever desires you have is that right 
or sometimes a way of understanding why not a rational person so never going to approach that model and 
we kick ourselves too hard for that but again just organizing categories to put your thoughts into and help 
see patterns across different decisions sc right economics is an interesting situation sort of visavis the public imagination a 
status occupation in many ways compared to theoretical physics which is what i do which is in different ways 
high status occupation but economists have a lot more relationship with policy or business or things like that and 
get criticism for things like imagine that people are more rational than they really are or being more interested 
the bottom line than in less tangible values what do you say to people who have those critiques in 
backs of their minds tc many of these critiques are correct economics is part science but also part art 
maybe a lot of people are twothirds rational may be the most rational people are those who have a 
of money on the line so that gives economics some predictive power but you need to approach it with 
humility and you know most people did not predict the financial crisis or the great depression for that matter 
not a forecasting science it helps you see patterns but also not the only way you can see more 
sc an interesting thing you just mentioned about people being more rational with more money on the line i 
certainly understand why that might be the case do we have evidence that actually true tc a chicago economist 
john list and he did a study of people trading baseball cards so a few of people trading the 
who are not used to doing this once they own the card they value it as much more just 
theirs like they identify with the card mine but professional traders are in a sense more ruthless more willing 
just buy and sell at whatever is the best price and this kind of result has been replicated a 
of other times so it does seem to be true that professionals with money on the line closer to 
least a naive economic conception of rational maximizing behavior sc interesting is this related to the fact that if 
for a house and you put a bid in on a house and someone bids it at more than 
to spend so you lose it very sad even though technically speaking you should not be sad that just 
more or less indifferent to paying exactly the amount that you would value the house at tc correct and 
some assumptions you should be sad when you win the house because that means you have curse you were 
highest bidder you are the one who overestimated what worth more than any of the other people sc and 
is it so how do we bring that to the lunch table what does it mean to go into 
restaurant and eat like an economist tc you need to figure out who in the restaurant can you actually 
what is the best dish will they take you seriously how do you establish your credibility if you just 
into a chinese restaurant and say the best dish actually serve you the worst one they might approach you 
a certain amount of contempt but if you tell them been to regional chinese cities and talk about different 
cuisines get their attention more willing to help so a question of learning how to communicate as much sociology 
economics getting back to the limitations of economics and being a good judge of people is worth at least 
much as knowing a lot about food i would say because the key question is whom to ask sc 
now a very good point i so i disagreed or i had questions about one of the points you 
in one of those books i forget which one it was but about the specials on the menu i 
that you made the point that if you look at a menu and something is in a box and 
looks like trying to push it the thing you should not order is that correct tc on average there 
exceptions but at least your initial instinct should be to shy away from it sc and the rationale behind 
tc if they have a special often something that not used to making if one of their best dishes 
wonder why it just on the menu sometimes just trying to get rid of the stock left in the 
there are a lot of reasons to be wary of specials in particular cases say well something is in 
truffle is a certain kind of mushroom then maybe take it more seriously but it could just be an 
and the guinea pig sc laughter and well and maybe you value that that will be okay if that 
of person that you like being the guinea pig tc sometimes you like stories like really really bad restaurants 
be the best meals of all for that reason right sc true or movies and so forth yes tc 
sc did would you say that always thought like an economist more or less and just become more professional 
it as grown up or is it something you discovered along the way tc when i was very young 
eleven years old i was a chess player and then i thought like a chess player which is not 
unlike thinking like an economist but chess players they learn how to calculate or think things through many steps 
also learn very early on a lot of their decisions are wrong good training for doing many things so 
i thought like a chess player then by age i started thinking like an economist and philosopher and then 
worked on building that up and in some ways trying to cure myself of thinking like an economist and 
more like a sociologist sc well an interesting point because always wondered about the fact that as professors as 
forced to choose our specialty fairly early in life right what are the chances that gonna figure out when 
or eighteen years old what you should be doing for a living are you happy with the choices you 
along those lines tc oh very much so but again as a professor this dangerous poison used to telling 
things and being a kind of authority and you need to get out of that mindset by having all 
of obstreperous friends who tell you full of crap and you need to keep balance because there are so 
incentives towards thinking right and not so many towards realizing wrong a lot sc have you been successful at 
obstreperous friends who tell you full of crap tc not for me to judge have to ask my obstreperous 
like how obstreperous are they really because a lot of people think they do this and part of the 
of thinking succeeded at everything including having obstreperous so only the friends know for sure sc where would you 
this is probably not a fair question but do you think academics err too much on agreeing with each 
or disagreeing with each other incentives for both in some sense tc way too much conformity bias in the 
sciences at least people who just kind of show up at the lunch table they talk about local politics 
small talk they more or less assume they agree with each other they think all that carefully about a 
of their views they integrate it with what the they know about economics and they just kind of sleepwalk 
intellectual life in some ways sc right tc read that much outside their fields sc well good i was 
say other than the obstreperous friends what is the tool kit what are things we can do to try 
be awakened from our dogmatic slumbers do you think tc well if a professor try to hire really good 
my school has done a great job at that some of my obstreperous friends are my colleagues but also 
a good relationship with your family not exactly your friends but typically they are people willing to tell you 
screwing up in different ways so cultivate those connections in ways that also help your career and not just 
family life and always confront yourself with reminders of like your own mortality like what you think is important 
a given moment is not a very reliable indicator as much of that as you can i try to 
art on the walls of my home actually to remind myself of my own mortality sc good yeah you 
sociology as something maybe that learning more about or trying to think more like but philosophy certainly shows up 
lot in the new book is that a professional interest in philosophy or is it just something you avoid 
you try to do economics tc both you avoid it when i was fourteen years old i thought i 
even become a philosopher prudence took hold much harder to get a good job that way but philosophy for 
is an interest almost as great as economics and this new book stubborn attachments an attempt to outline the 
foundations of our economic judgments like why is capitalism good why are rational choices justifiable at all sc so 
have to confess gonna ask you the most obvious question what are the attachments that we are stubbornly attached 
that you refer to in the title of the new book tc well i argue we should be stubbornly 
to the idea of economic growth with compounding returns it is more powerful than any other utilitarian factor in 
human wellbeing and the other thing we should be stubbornly attached to is human rights which in some instances 
absolute you simply should not violate rights no matter what and those two blades economic growth and human rights 
we follow those and all stubbornly attached to them things will just turn out wonderful and not really so 
pursue other sc right i tc at the macro level sc i thought i can say i think i 
enjoyed the book by the way very short i encourage listeners to read it a set of big ideas 
i quite come across before and one of those books whether you agree with it or not worth taking 
can i ask do how much of your intention when writing a book like this is to provoke people 
think differently in addition to saying things that are true tc somewhat but the main intention in any book 
write is to provoke myself to figure out what i think at all so like unsolved problems in my 
and i only work them out by writing about them so a very selfish endeavor maybe i should have 
reader more in mind but i not so much a didactic purpose but more directed toward me sc yeah 
know i feel the same way and also with the podcast i know that also a podcaster my personal 
goal is to have conversations that i enjoy do you find that not only for books but for your 
communicative strategy tc sure my podcasts conversations with tyler called not paid to do them even indirectly i think 
earn me any money so better enjoy it but the main reason i do it is partly to ask 
questions but also to focus my own reasoning so if studying paul krugman or larry summers or kareem abduljabbar 
learn so much reading about them so the improvement in my thinking before the podcast ever happens the biggest 
for me sc exactly i definitely find the same thing and so i think we have the time here 
wanna really dig into the philosophical presuppositions in the new book so you mentioned a sort of consequentialist aspect 
how thinking we should do things to get some large good but not a pure consequentialist do you wanna 
that a little bit with some rules some rights how specific can you be about how we mix this 
of being utilitarian or consequentialist with human rights or other rulebased deontological guidelines tc most of my book is 
the consequentialism and i think i say in the preface something like twothirds usually consequences are the thing that 
but should we slaughter large numbers of innocent babies just to boost gdp a bit i definitely wanna say 
so carving out for the reader a kind of protected sphere these are the things we do and then 
the space of left trying to figure out best now again i keep on coming back to this idea 
compounding returns if you can get compounding returns probably doing the right thing say the core point of the 
on the practical issues and also with your own education your own knowledge like are you learning in some 
of compounding way over time if not probably not getting very far sc right now i wanna get into 
returns in detail but i think that this prior claim which i thought to be the most substantial one 
you think that we discount the future consequences too much i know that economists professionally discount future predictions a 
bit but as utilitarians people often try to get the greatest good for the greatest number of people alive 
now and saying people alive a hundred generations from now should count for almost as much is that right 
once they arrive they are no less real so imagine that cleopatra several thousand years ago had decided she 
take an extra helping of dessert knowing that this would lead to the death of three thousand people today 
could in principle justify a decision like that but i think indefensible so you know as individuals we often 
out of weakness like go to the dentist another week but at the societal level to really care about 
future and our descendants and make decisions to reflect that including say on climate change the rate of savings 
much we innovate messing up myopic and plenty of laboratory evidence that human beings can be very myopic sc 
let me just get exactly the substantive claim though should when we add up our tc zero discount them 
zero sc zero okay good tc zero sc very specific number tc now you discount for risk if not 
if something will happen you down weight it accordingly but you discount it just because further away in time 
okay what do you say to the various suggested puzzles that utilitarian approaches get themselves into if every life 
worth a little bit and not discounting the future at all should everybody just have as many babies as 
possibly could or the repugnant conclusion sure familiar with do you have strategies to get out of these tc 
do think we should aim for institutions that encourage people to have more children subsidizing education is one way 
doing that making sure that living in major american cities or say london is affordable is another way of 
that and the fact that these policies can sustainably support more people is a reason to do them i 
you simply want to boost numbers for their own sake you want people to want to have the children 
raise them properly more likely to boost economic growth then trying to make the whole world like some kind 
teaming slum but absolutely the numbers should count and the richer we are the more people be able to 
with our resources sc right okay so is there a principled defense of heavy discounting i know people take 
for granted and saying you discount at all what is the counterargument what are people saying that we care 
five generations in the future nearly as much as today tc well people sometimes confuse the perspective of a 
with that of all of society so if a corporation and doing budgeting and calculating in monetary terms for 
lot of purposes you should use various kinds of discount rates that is not incorrect but if talking about 
or wellbeing and all of society for the distant future affecting entire lives when we should apply this zero 
of discount so most of the criticisms i think comes from people confusing the corporate case with the societal 
sc is it fair i had the image so i wanna see if you agree with it or not 
reading the book of you being the temporal version of peter singer singer has made tried to make the 
where you should care about a life of a person thousands of miles away who never met just as 
as a person you see drowning in a lake is that analogous to what saying about future generations tc 
and i once interviewed singer on bloggingheads tv and i found him very shortsighted all about redistributing wealth now 
than increasing the size of the pie and the human race over time sc okay tc and the wrong 
i want to increase the size of the pie which also means you can afford more redistribution i might 
sc right so you think that figured it out with respect to space but not yet with respect to 
tc i hope i have had influence on him i am not so sure sc okay very good okay 
the sort well let and i guess not quite satisfied with my own personal understanding of the balance i 
mentioned between the utilitarian part of things and the deontological part of things so you invent a concept called 
plus could you explain that tc wealth plus is similar to what we today call gdp but some problems 
gdp it properly account for the value of the environment and it properly account for the value of leisure 
so i just want to adjust gdp a bit to make it a finer measure wealth plus basically and 
time a much richer society is gonna be much happier much better off more creative more rewarding than a 
poorer society even if not at first if you look at countries that have say a third or the 
of the per capita income of america really much worse places to live and you see this in terms 
where people want to migrate sc and is one of the nice things about gdp is very quantifiable do 
think that an equally precise even if not accurate formula for wealth plus tc sure it can be hard 
measure the value of the environment leisure time pretty easy to measure the value of but come as close 
we can and for the most part actually wealthier societies are also cleaner not in every regard not with 
to carbon but for the most part regular wealth and environmental quality they actually move together try visiting a 
poor country if you want to demonstrate that point to yourself so the imperfections of measurements not sure actually 
main problem getting people to want to do it sc okay and then but we simply maximize wealth plus 
are also rights that we trample on in order to do that is how clearly delineated are those rights 
are you just happy at this point to say sure there are rights we can talk about tc the 
like i said the rights are not the main focus of my book i think worth people spending much 
time talking about that but if someone says i wanna maximize something gonna force every woman to have nine 
would say a violation of rights look at ways of subsidizing societies so they become wealthier to support more 
and more resources sc right in some sense i would associate deontological approaches more with a kind of libertarian 
outlook in the sense that let people do what they want and let the consequences fall where they may 
are you sort of being a libertarian consequentialist is that a thing that exists tc it exists now i 
say very close to my view you could say a small l libertarian but i think taxation is intrinsically 
i think there are a lot of public goods which governments should actively supply in some cases such as 
or subsidizing science i think doing enough right now but our governments are very bad at many things like 
running the new york city subway and we also need to liberate private enterprise more but government in the 
not always substitutes you wanna look for policies that actually boost both of them at the same time sc 
okay so if we buy the idea that conventional approaches discount future generations far too much your second big 
you bring in is that the best way maybe exaggerate this and you can correct me the best way 
help the future generations is to maximize our rate of economic growth right now is that right tc correct 
to hand down to them high quality institutions which will help them maximize their rate of economic growth so 
want sustainability of the growth why the environment is important because a bad environment can threaten sustainability so like 
value looking forward sc and is there is tc and if you have a society growing sorry say at 
time over a two hundred years that will be much much wealthier than a society growing at sc right 
the miracle of compound growth tc and again due to compounding sc yeah exactly tc right sc and is 
can i say the claim is that if you have lots of economic growth more or less everyone benefits 
just we could imagine in principle economic growth where a tiny slice of people benefited a lot and a 
of people but empirically that seem to be the case is that what was in the back of our 
here tc over time virtually everyone benefits in the first year not everyone benefits a lot of people are 
out of work all kinds of problems which you can see on the evening news any night but if 
look at countries that devote themselves to economic growth such as south korea or japan and you look at 
they are now compared to say at eighty years ago i absolutely think correct that virtually everyone is better 
but not in the given year right sc sure tc clearly not people get upset sc yeah and is 
what is the theoretical or empirical argument as to why that is the case we should if this is 
be a major policy driver we should try to understand why it is true that everyone benefits rather than 
nightmare where one person gets all the wealth and everyone else suffers tc humans can do things with resources 
want to produce for other humans sell things to other human beings economic growth is exactly that process of 
out which goods and services other people want and if you have more of it over time again real 
will rise wages will rise people will take better more rewarding and safer jobs have more choice as to 
to marry health care will be better education will be better be less infant mortality so many angles of 
lives become a lot better sc well what is the connection between having more choices about who to marry 
economic growth tc well so you have an agricultural society poor everyone lives in a small village not very 
you have railways odds are marry someone right in your village if gay probably less toleration of being gay 
there is in most countries today and you might marry someone of the opposite gender and not actually wanna 
that pretty common in human history and capitalism has eased a lot of those constraints sc okay so the 
is something like a kind of cosmopolitanism or even sort of a liberalism of values that goes along with 
economic prosperity tc and it will over time make virtually everyone happy maybe not misanthropes right sc right tc 
i think you can say everyone is better off but if the misanthropes are the main problem i feel 
are looking pretty good for economic growth sc well so how do you think about cases like china for 
where getting a lot of economic growth with less political or social liberties than we have here do you 
that gonna be a temporary condition and greater prosperity will lead to greater liberalization or is it just a 
we pay tc a common pattern in other east asian economies you see it in taiwan you see it 
in singapore you see it in south korea also japan that at some point of wealth people demand democracy 
given to them now china is about arriving at that point not clear they will actually democratize i very 
believe it would be better if they did i think china should have been a democracy all along it 
would not have been stable so i think the communist party has actually done a pretty remarkable job there 
we should credit them for that but a tyrannical also somewhat inefficient institution and it needs to reform and 
into something much better as say taiwan has done see if it happens not guaranteed sc no right not 
sure that there are arguments back and forth so i was just interested in your perspective one person might 
with greater economic prosperity comes more resources people can talk to each other they can share ideas can act 
demand more say in how the country is run someone more pessimistic might say that we have technologies and 
of control now that might make a repressive autocracy more stable harder to rebel against do you have feelings 
this tc the wealthy western democracies so far have been quite stable as democracies i see any of them 
into the chinese model the chinese model arguably is becoming less stable power is more centralized in china than 
was even a few years ago all that ability to have surveillance i think will prove destabilizing rather than 
good thing for them the idea is you give everyone a social credit score and get complete cooperation i 
be able to make that work so there is a kind of competition of systems going on not only 
i favor the capitalist democracies but i would be willing to bet on them and in a sense i 
with my life choices sc right so what does it come down to in terms of straightforward policy prescriptions 
now what are the things that our country should do to maximize economic growth as opposed to some of 
alternatives tc we should regulate most of our economy much less but that said many parts of the environment 
should be tougher with regulations we should spend more money subsidizing science in some cases build more infrastructure and 
culturally move to a situation where possible say to build the golden gate bridge in three years as we 
did to build the empire state building as quickly as we did to put a man on the moon 
basically seven years starting from scratch lost a lot of those capabilities it can take us decades just to 
one subway line in manhattan so some of it is we need a cultural shift but those would be 
of the policies i would change sc why does it take us so long to fix the subway in 
i mean los angeles where not no better in terms of new subway lines but at least new york 
existing tc no much better sc you think i i mean tc done a much better job than any 
american city still poor by chinese standards i might add there are so many overlapping authorities that have to 
a goahead for the new york city subway there can be labor unions it can be new york state 
authority different commissions and getting them all in sync and the public and how you pay for it just 
a long long time and way past an optimal point on that curve sc do you think this is 
a sort of tc way past sc human inclination to the love of bureaucracy once you have things that 
institutions that have existed for a very long time people write rules and implement them even though they are 
longer really applicable tc oh yes natural but even within the us some places are much better and worse 
others so think that what we have is inevitable and cannot be changed it can be changed and our 
not long ago was much less bureaucratic as well sc okay but how does so what about you do 
in the book about the distribution of wealth especially governmental mechanisms that redistribute it i might guess although i 
seeing in the book that be against something like the universal basic income on the theory that that would 
people right now in some way but maybe slow down economic growth longterm and therefore it would be a 
negative in this nondiscounted view tc i like the idea of paying people not to work i also feel 
make say people who are disabled or very old or maybe lost their parents this is what we should 
but not do it for everyone the best kinds of redistributions are those that say educate poor children or 
up their health or end malnutrition and those also boost wealth so if you follow the lode star of 
wealth be led toward the better rather than the worst redistributions sc okay so not that we should be 
of redistribution in general but you wanna give people the tools to make better lives for themselves and then 
will increase across the board tc right but way less enthusiastic about just taking money from rich people and 
it to poor if the incentive on both sides is to work less and create less then i generally 
do it i would just say stick with wealth enhancing redistribution plenty of that we can do very powerful 
do you have feelings about the level of inequality in the us today or is level of inequality irrelevant 
more about incentives towards wealth creation tc i look more at incentives toward wealth creation inequality is an expost 
of the big distribution i would just say look at concrete barriers against opportunity and there are many for 
and take more of them away so in that sense inequality matters a lot but focus on the distribution 
if rich people get richer and the poor people are no worse off to me fine sc right yeah 
are certainly other people who would disagree with that but i get i think on your side there so 
very much in favor of better education especially for poor people better maybe better health care also to get 
out of the risky times early in life and then so everyone can grow up more or less healthy 
well educated and try to make a wealthier country tc air pollution lead in the water to me these 
very big issues even in the us certainly for the world as a whole we give them far too 
attention actually which is remarkable so we should reorient our thinking on redistribution to the most effective kinds sc 
you said more support for scientific research not gonna argue with that but what about more support for other 
of intellectual endeavors whether humanities or arts or other things how do those factor into wealth creation tc i 
put it this way not sure always how the arts and humanities factor into wealth creation not as clear 
as science the system we have now is we have state universities which indirectly support those a lot and 
compete with different systems and when not sure exactly the best thing to do then keener to have federalism 
these competing experiments so i like the idea that our universities if public sector done by the states and 
by the federal government especially for the arts and humanities so i would say i know the right answer 
when you know the way to approach it sc and how do we fit the goal of increasing human 
into this over history we i think we can argue that increased human rights at least in the subset 
liberal democracies and so forth do you think that just comes along for the ride when we increase wealth 
is this something we should be separately agitating for or are those not really competing ideals tc they mostly 
together but not in all cases in the united states our rate of incarceration is disgracefully high and even 
much wealthier that seem to have stopped it in some ways it helps us afford it so i feel 
should take dramatic action to say limit or end the war on drugs change the incentives of public prosecutors 
not always trying to ask for higher and higher sentences that voters need to not always just leap with 
candidates who claim tough on crime that to me is probably the biggest violation of human rights in our 
right sc right and we tc would be our penal system sc yeah tc they get a lot of 
people are guilty just to be clear but they deserve the treatment they get in most cases sc right 
guilty of breaking laws that we made up right some of those laws are not even very good at 
tc sure some of them a lot of them are just genuinely guilty of real crimes but still the 
that because you committed armed robbery three times you have to join a gang and maybe be gang raped 
the shower and have this horrible existence that to me is not right sc do you have an explanation 
mind as to why the united states is so different from its fellow liberal democracies in that aspect tc 
think we have a much more violent history where firearms were intimately connected to settling and taming this nation 
we have stayed in that culture and then just very diverse and a very large country and we have 
very strong pressures for social conformity so the upside is we have more creativity but also a lot more 
behaving in crazy destructive ways and i really have like a big picture fix for that sc right so 
me ask gonna shift gears here a little bit back to the idea of not discounting future generations as 
cosmologist who thinks about the whole history of the universe i have in mind integrating all of the wealth 
or whatever other measure we have over the course of many many many years and i get the argument 
due to compound returns if the rate of growth is a little bit bigger now that has huge effects 
the future another thing that would have huge effects in the future is the end of civilization if we 
the planet or something like that is this fits in with your philosophy i guess is why you keep 
up the environment presumably the prospect of truly disastrous climate change if that is something that could happen would 
something that in your philosophy we should work very hard to avoid right tc yeah also we should spend 
say on asteroid defense or at least developing those capabilities sc tc other way as a cosmologist if i 
just sc pleasure tc most likely the best theory of the universe is it string theory is it something 
is it many worlds quantum mechanics your opinion sc oh i have very strong opinions about this so it 
on the detailed definition you have of theory of the universe i am a strong proponent of the many 
interpretation of quantum mechanics i think by far the simplest and i can even give the sales pitch for 
if you want to very briefly but a framework not a specific theory we still need to understand what 
laws of physics are that push the way function of the universe forward even once given the many worlds 
you could be a string theorist and believe in many worlds or not i used to be pretty optimistic 
string theory these days less so for a number of reasons and more thinking that we just need to 
take something like strings and quantize them we need to look at quantum mechanics from the start and find 
and spacetime and the universe within it if that makes sense tc and what makes the many worlds different 
is it that branching based on quantum states sc yeah exactly if you tc and if so does the 
of worlds rise very rapidly sc it rises very tc as time passes sc yep it rises very rapidly 
every time that a quantum system that is in superposition becomes entangled with its environment the universe branches and 
happens a lot still nowhere near so many universes we have to worry about running out even if a 
number we can estimate the total number of universes allowed to have way bigger than the number of branching 
that have occurred tc set me straight on my worry then if we apply an anthropic principle does this 
increase of branches mean very very close to the end of the universe as we know it or the 
sc no in some reasonable measures half way in some sense we your intuition is right if we keep 
branching there is a limit past which branching ceases to make sense very very much like the growth of 
in a system so if you start very orderly and you let entropy go it will increase eventually with 
equilibrium and equilibrium means entropy grow any more likewise there will be a place when branching happen anymore but 
be very far in the future tc but we likely to be living in the most branched universe maximum 
because we could be in any number of different world states so probably in a very densely populated part 
the multiverse with a lot of branches and that means pretty close to the end or is that wrong 
no i think tc not telling you sc yeah no i get it tc i just have worried about 
sc no i get it i think that there is a reasonable anthropic argument as you imply that universes 
ours should be dense into the space of universes but this is a very interesting question that intentionally or 
goes exactly back to this temporal discussion having is it in any sense reasonable to say that we live 
a typical time in the history of the universe and i think the answer there is no exactly because 
far away from equilibrium you i think you can make an argument that you live in a typical place 
time if things around you look more or less the same but in space things look more or less 
same from megaparsec to megaparsec but in time the universe is evolving very rapidly so sort of just by 
we have no reason to think that we live in a typical time in the history of the universe 
and do you think physical space is infinite in the universe we have sc i tc not the multiverse 
you get what asking right sc yeah the observable universe is absolutely finite and our best theory says it 
remain finite there is a horizon that has a fixed size and never be able to see beyond it 
are deep questions about whether or not there is any such thing as what is outside that horizon or 
which we know the answer to tc yeah a whole literature on infinite ethics how do you do ethics 
the number of people is infinity i suspect simply not tractable but been reading more on this lately sc 
no thinking along the same lines which is why part of why i asked this question how if you 
take as a posit that future generations count just as much as current ones we have to think very 
about the future of consciousness and uploading into computers and living in a simulation and the end of the 
sort of creating as many conscious observers as quickly as possible just so they can be around for as 
as possible become a very worthwhile goal tc i am all for creating more conscious observers when you say 
quickly as possible you need to weight that for stability but i do think it should be a goal 
sure settling other planets will ever be possible but in so far as it might be i would favor 
it also diversifies against risk i think quite a good chance we all last another eight hundred years but 
in like year three hundred or four hundred from now we can just make things much much better than 
otherwise would be but the idea that just gonna have like a million more years to play around with 
and the cosmos that strikes me as unlikely i think destroy ourselves sc a million is not that long 
speaking or even biologically speaking tc but for sc for humans very very long yeah tc we if you 
of weapons of mass destruction the chance used in a major way in any year is quite small but 
let enough years tick off and at some point it will happen sc absolutely so if we tc my 
worry sc i think a very big worry and also i was recently impressed upon the danger of solar 
for destroying the civilization as we know it solar flares happen all the time not that big but very 
that there is a long tail and once every thousand years a solar flare comes along that would completely 
out the electrical grid if that were true we would never know because a thousand years ago there was 
electrical grid to to exist so i think these existential risks are individually far out but collectively very worth 
into consideration tc exactly my view sc and what do you think about simulations and uploading brains do you 
that those will count just as much as conscious feeling creatures to whom we should give weight when we 
wealth plus tc well in a computational sense arguably simulations now so not sure that the distinction between we 
people and the simulations is well defined so if conscious intelligent sentient beings with emotions and complex lives and 
and plans they should count a lot of nonhuman animals probably should count for more than we count them 
could dream up creatures that just not capable of understanding and i tell you how much they should count 
not count for but in the meantime we sort of know what we have to work with right now 
but it does suggest a strategy for maximizing something which is work as hard as we can to make 
intelligent creatures and then send them on spaceships with the ability to selfreproduce and scatter them throughout the galaxy 
so we have as we have a bulwark against existential risks that is as strong as we can imagine 
put our artificially intelligent creatures around every star in the galaxy tc i favor trying to do this not 
how possible it would be but subsidizing science now will get us toward that call not right before us 
if we invest much more heavily in basic science have a chance so i favor trying to do panspermia 
would like to see also private philanthropy get more involved selfreplicating neumann powered by different stars around the galaxy 
it rip send biological material around with more advanced technologies send probes that attempt some version of terraforming but 
in the short run so many problems to solve that just mean making better science now sc right right 
the solutions doing the things that you just listed all which sound great like you say know the direct 
to doing them so maybe just learning some basic science and technology is actually the best strategy for the 
term right tc and getting people to respect the notion of doing things quickly and doing them well like 
science so effectively did throughout most of the century and not losing that culture which is not really just 
money thing a mental thing sc it is my personal beliefs tc so rates of productivity yeah were much 
than they are right now scientific progress other than like tech and law it was mostly much more rapid 
it was and two kinds going on tc look at how the sc sorry i think two things going 
that not sure of their relative magnitude one is with the manhattan project in world war ii physicists sort 
like myself got a lot more credit than we deserve for making the world a good place or at 
affecting the outcomes that happen in the world and therefore we were flooded with money and it was good 
could do a lot of research even if it pay off immediately and sort of gone away been a 
since a great physics discovery has changed the geopolitical landscape like that one did the other one is that 
i say in my book the big picture the laws of physics underlying everyday life have been figured out 
know what atoms and particles are the discoveries that we get in fundamental physics these days lead to any 
advances the technological advances come from higher level things condensed matter physics biophysics chemistry and things like that tc 
i see some retrogressions like with nuclear power which is quite green you look at how planes advanced airplanes 
their first say sixty years compared to how advanced in the last forty to fifty years a big difference 
flying planes basically designed in the late which no one at the time would have thought would have been 
case so i see traffic is much worse a lot of areas where just content to be quite mediocre 
and for the tc and some of it a policy problem sc yeah wondered about the planes what is 
with planes is it just the sound barrier or is it just that we tried very hard to make 
airplanes tc some of it is regulatory some of it is i just think a hard problem a move 
to relegalize supersonic transport there are sonic boom issues i think probably we can deal with those or just 
should be more willing to tolerate them so we should aim for a world where you can get in 
of a minispace shuttle and go from new york to tokyo in three hours it does seem not that 
away if we choose to do it sc yeah i know if ever seen the man in the high 
on netflix tc no but i know the book sc right so the idea based on the axis won 
war ii and the united states is divided up between japan and germany and set in the and all 
the germans fly around on supersonic transports as a regular thing in that alternative history that technology was developed 
more quickly tc sure i mean another area where you see slow down just recently is life expectancy so 
in in this country life expectancy fell awful sc is that right i know that i realize that bad 
that was not the case throughout earlier parts of the century now by tiny amounts but not advancing a 
report you can read that shows this and again in say that a would have been impossible and b 
not have been tolerated it would be like a big national campaign to turn this around now like even 
people not aware of this to me a cultural failure sc and is the united states or is that 
countries tc the united states sc okay tc other countries mostly still advancing now life expectancy is hard to 
ambiguities but still that even possible for our cdc to measure it as having fallen two years in a 
to me is astonishing a public health issue not taking good care of ourselves there are opioids and science 
not advancing fast enough to undo those problems one way to put it and no one really gives a 
sc yeah now all that are we certainly spend a lot of money on those last few weeks of 
lives and a weird thing that maybe other cultures do as much but extending the profitable part of our 
is something less good at tc correct sc and tc so i think a lot of ways in which 
up and could do better sc yeah so what do do how have people reacted to the book is 
book is out yet right is that correct tc not out yet it comes out october so it has 
been reviewed yet early readers quite like it but obviously they tend to be people who already know me 
maybe not objective but i view this book as kind of the culmination of my thought on a free 
thinking about it actually writing the book over a period so like my most important book to me sc 
yeah like i said i thought the ideas in there are wonderful and provocative and i remember taking a 
philosophy course with john rawls when i was at harvard and he said his goal is not that he 
correct but that there be no mistakes in the book so what he meant was some axioms some starting 
and you can disagree with that but from the starting points you should derive the correct conclusions and i 
any obvious mistakes in your book i think that people can probably disagree with some of the initial starting 
which is fair enough right tc thank you tell you what i think was big mistake it had to 
with economic growth he was overly enamored of steady state stationary state of john stuart mill and he thought 
was possibly unjust because the first generation they were the worst off people and to be asking them to 
and help grow the economy he worried that might be wrong and very different from my view as you 
and that i think is the weak spot in rawls that most people talk about sc well when he 
us in the original position maybe one of the things that is not there is not supposed to know 
you are in the world right but maybe secretly he implied that you knew when you were in the 
and if you imagine this whole future ahead of us that we been to yet then maybe the decisions 
made would be different if we could make that future better tc i think he should have admitted it 
across generations and i think in his later political liberalism he at least implicitly more or less says this 
since you brought up rawls i just thought i would give you my take on it sc perfectly fair 
a brilliant thinker and writer but i think on economic growth underrating it sc yeah and so i guess 
obvious clash once the book does come out which probably so we know will be just before this podcast 
released so people will have a chance to read it if they want i presume that people who are 
directly interested and focused on human rights social justice things like that economic justice will resist the conclusion even 
they go through all the steps is your response to them simply you know fighting for economic justice and 
rights but just for future generations just as much as us tc that is absolutely my response tried to 
this book to in part persuade people a somewhat different vision of economic justice involving the future sc and 
have a great story so just to sort of wrap up here i really do want you to share 
story of where the profits for this book are gonna go tc a fellow i met in ethiopia i 
him yonas he was my travel guide in lalibela which is a famous ethiopian city with old stone churches 
of all the people i met in ethiopia he struck me as maybe the smartest and the most stable 
had good english he supports a family his income is really quite low i visited his house and i 
to send him all of the royalties i receive from this book so i will get nothing and he 
get all of it so if you buy my book you are helping to support yonas and his family 
ten people including his children his parents and to me a very worthy cause i argue in the book 
should be more altruistic at the margin and think more about like other people and my chance to do 
for him but also for the future at least the future of ethiopia so i think i said it 
the beginning i very much believe people should live what they write and part of my highly imperfect attempt 
do that sc i mean i help but be the curmudgeonly one who asks this is not really in 
tradition of effective altruism where you should spread your wealth a little bit more widely so in some sense 
you setting an example just as much as actually trying to help the world with this gesture tc well 
helping ten people i say widely but more than just one person but i view it as myself as 
capitalist you know who will steward the funds most effectively and making a bet on yonas because of the 
i spent with him sc it sounds like a good bet to me tyler cowen thanks so much for 
on the podcast tc my pleasure thank you for your insights on physics and all the questions sc my 
thanks i wish you had pressed dr cowen more on his shaky metaethical foundations these consequentialist deontological systems rarely 
scrutiny which is why progrowth evangelists try to muddy it up a little no one wants to live in 
global sum yet apparently we should promote birth no one wants to be among those consigned to absolute poverty 
the majority will benefit from these questions are real and need real answers also a zerodiscount theory of the 
of future generations is unpopular in metaethics for good reasons any chance for an interview with kahneman or another 
theorist particularly interested in learning what parts of decision theory remain robust under the pressure of the socalled replication 
all points well taken love to talk to kahneman or someone closely related see what i can arrange thanks 
responding huge fan of your podcast and other work in general hi eli i agreed with most of what 
said however zerodiscount theory of the value of future generations is unpopular in metaethics for good could you elaborate 
some of those reasons and i have heard the opposite ie that a zero discount rate is a majority 
among at least some groups of moral philosophers great episode the only problem was that it longer it seems 
there is so much more you guys could explore i would love to see you do an episode with 
wiblin on effective altruism and his research at hours also tim maudlin on his views about the nature of 
but another subject tyler called the repugnant conclusion because the best measure philosophers have for moral it there are 
more substantive reasons not to equally weight future generations they are not part of our moral community they do 
exist they have no reciprocal obligations toward us the intervening years magnify the prediction problem for consequentialism their needs 
may be radically different pretty much every argument people make against effective altruism also applies here pingback tuesday assorted 
marginal revolution interesting and much to like but submit still largely myopic in fact in the past cited dr 
and other economists as and yes the charge can be accurately leveled at me as well and almost anyone 
part because human knowledge doubles about every twelve months in general not something to be ashamed of unless one 
wholly closed to new knowledge but alas a biological variation that works in the short term in some cultural 
growth wealth are positives but i submit not as measured by monetary code a complaint i have with economists 
seem to understand or at least acknowledge code including monetary code in a physics evolution complexity context here are 
quotes that cite the fundamental importance of code in those contexts story of human intelligence starts with a universe 
is capable of encoding ray kurzweil and conditions rule in complex stewart brand additional myopics exponentially accelerating complexity which 
submit is the dominant phenomenon of our era greatly diminishes the efficacy of consequentialism our ability to grok consequences 
increasingly weakened by complexity increases from complexity scientist and physicist yaneer baryam simpler times judging a policymaker based upon 
or claims made sense today they tell what their actions will the environment in which we live the complexity 
becomes higher and higher and basically like making random in addition complexity weakens the efficacy of code code is 
generated and physics efficacious relationship infrastructure in bio cultural tech networks genetic language math moral religious legal monetary software 
consider this world dominant app for generating vast relationship structures inandacross geo eco bio cultural tech networks and across 
is humans deploying monetary code that app accelerated our evolution but in the unprecedented and exponentially accruing complexity of 
present environs the efficacy of humans deploying monetary code has been blown up the app lacks information processing reach 
accuracy power is often used to throttle creativity all of which are fundamental information processing criteria for passing multilevel 
tests i respect dr cowen sincere and knowledgeable i think his lack of knowledge in certain areas cripples his 
i submit albeit incompletely fundamentally that is evolutionarily humans are biologically coded for relationship interface with local environs in 
relatively shortterm manner not coded to process complex relationship information at a global scale with exponential dynamics and myriad 
consequences which is partly why so many of the consequences are unknown not coded biologically or culturally to process 
alien unprecedented environs we continue to generate by way of our numbers powers and reach this biologicalculturalcodetoenvirons mismatch is 
emergent phenomenon that accrues as complexity accelerates exponentially i submit that our current biological and cultural coding is nonselectable 
know but suspect that we overcome this mismatch given the time constraints pingback sean carrolls mindscape podcast tyler cowen 
maximizing growth and thinking for the future three quarks daily great podcast i love tyler cowen and think he 
the one of the finest thinkers of our time be nice to discuss things that economists believe that physicists 
remember when financial crash happened and lee smolin et al went to macroeconomics with gauge theory etc to it 
nice motives but many economists complained that knowing great math make you a great economist things like that fyi 
has discussed the impact of the replication crises blog mr has the references sorry not going to locate them 
you cowen typically asks his blog followers should i ask prior to his interviewing person x and the interest 
the serious imho problem in the social sciences was very recently brought up in the comments when person x 
kahneman interesting interview one question i wished you had pressed cowen on is why is economic growth the end 
and be all for humanity his view seems to be that we should always aim for economic growth so 
we can sustain more people so that we can have more economic growth his logic seems circular if you 
me fundamentally can the economy grow infinitely why should we always be aiming to increase economic growth and increase 
human population did i miss the part where cowen explained how all this growth would affect the environment it 
clear that growth cannot include the continual growth in human numbers its like everything he says is really great 
then he says growth that gift to the family in ethiopia it is totally understandable to me that when 
make a gift to a person you have met you become the immediate and continued recipient of your imagining 
the good you have done maybe that is a bit more selfish than giving to a trustee in some 
but i admire it no less i have not read any of his books so he may have addressed 
questions i like his idea of wealth plus as opposed to gdp but the shortcomings of gdp are monetary 
what is the best way to measure the value of economic growth and wealth with human rights in mind 
it monetarily amounts of leisurely time calorie count life expectancy what kind of compounding returns monetary returns material returns 
returns of leisure time in my opinion the problem we need to focus on is pretty evident and the 
should be scalable if approached from a fundamental level how do we more equitably manage and share our resources 
ideas on governing the common is a great start in my opinion a society that equally allocates access to 
natural resources and education needed for individuals to freely provide themselves with their most basic of human needs will 
afford an equal foundation for individuals to build an independent level of wealth wellbeing and status their distinct potential 
which then promotes a high degree of freedom in choice speech thought and economic mobility a society that forgoes 
discourse on the evolving definition of individual needs and wants will constrain equality and freedom through a rule of 
that is easily corrupted by those who have the means to acquiring the controlling share of their private property 
resources i was excited to hear from someone who takes both utilitarianism and economics seriously this interview was interesting 
frustrating at moments tyler cowen does not draw the distinction between some important concepts terminal goal something that you 
for its own sake instrumental goal something that you want because it helps you achieve a terminal goal convergent 
goal an instrumental goal which arises in the pursuit of a large number of terminal goals wealth production is 
convergent instrumental goal in that no matter what you want having more money is likely to help you achieve 
however it is not a great terminal goal tyler never seems to define his terminal goals which i find 
bit worrying instead he appears to hold the position that it does not matter what our terminal goals are 
a society when we figure them out we will be better poised to attain them so long as we 
pursue the instrumental goal of wealth production now so that is what we should focus on a problem with 
mentality is that it does not acknowledge the potential diminishing returns of the instrumental goal in service of terminal 
this is especially worrying with regard to advocating for increasing population under the premise that this will result in 
productivity as we are potentially on the verge an automationai explosion that could result in a significant portion of 
population being completely unemployable i was a bit confused by use of the term does he actually mean optimum 
there seem to be quite some restriction on his maximum growth concept like environmental neutrality support for human rights 
it seems not really to be maximized economic growth and as was already mentioned permanent maximum growth just has 
wrong ring forme sean i have a ton of respect for you but if going to stay subscribed i 
need you to press guys like this further you may have come to different conclusions than i regarding how 
irresponsible and dangerous his positions are but they are certainly worth challenging and i felt a complete lack of 
sense of urgency on your part to do so i am broke and working for minimum wage to pay 
my student debt uninsured at and well below the poverty line i am that sacrificial lamb that so casually 
as a necessary cost for the future wellbeing of our species and if i agreed with him i might 
some solace in that knowledge as much as like to give him the benefit of the doubt regarding his 
do you really think he would trade places with me for the betterment of mankind i recognize that as 
result of an understandable mistake you were unable to do your research but his points are grounded in assumptions 
plainly unfounded that it makes me worried that you share them without realizing it i worry that you have 
blind spot here and would seriously appreciate you releasing a postmortem of this conversation if on looking back you 
see the points where you should have interjected what a when i read the title i thought this conversation 
be like a live performance of tom two thousand twelve delightful economist meets finite blog post in it he 
a dinner conversation between a physicist himself and an economist about the hard limitations physics impose on the idea 
exponential economic growth in simple terms the basic rationale is that a given rate of economic growth so far 
always depended on an equal or higher rate of energy consumption growth and earth has only one mechanism for 
heat to space and via infrared radiation we understand the phenomenon perfectly well and can predict the surface temperature 
the planet as a function of how much energy the human race produces the upshot is that at a 
rate conveniently chosen to represent a increase every century we would reach boiling temperature in about four hundred years 
this statement is independent of technology even if we have a name for the energy source yet as long 
it obeys thermodynamics we cook ourselves with perpetual energy love to know what sean thinks about this and to 
had him brought up this line of argument during the podcast with eli that i wish you pressed a 
more on the economics but i have different reasons tyler cowen references growth for reasons not to redistribute from 
rich to poor at least in some ways but not actually targeting growth a lot of poor people probably 
far more for growth than many rich people doing more for society a minimum wage walmart or mcdonalds employee 
some rich person that inherited a bunch of money spends like crazy and lives off interest and what about 
of these rich singers football players etc they are adding something to society but are they really growing society 
think so would cowen be on board with creating some sort of index about how much money people have 
how well they are doing with that money then redistribute wealth from the lowest to the highest that would 
be concentrating on growth furthermore universal basic income will add to a potential to create wealth because homeless people 
much of an ability to create growth by giving people the basics such as food housing education health care 
possibly even something like internet access a poor person will have a much greater likelihood of creating growth part 
the problem now is that creating growth tends to take money and government programs attempt to give as little 
as possible to help people hold their head above water so poor people on government programs have the ability 
risk wealth for growth pingback should taxation be regressive askblog comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the
