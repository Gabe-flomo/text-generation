cryptocurrencies and online privacy download episode click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everybody and welcome to the 
podcast your host sean carroll and today talking about a subject that is near and dear to the hearts 
most everyone out there money we all know what money is right we use money we exchange it for 
and services as homer simpson once pointed out but we also get this feeling that the notion of money 
in flux right now the notion of currency the actual thing you give to somebody which used to be 
bills of course increasingly credit one way or the other and these days this talk of crypto currencies like 
and ethereum and so forth somehow the computer scientists have gotten their hands on money and the world might 
be the same the question is how is this new world gonna look if you followed the bitcoin situation 
all you know a bit of instability in the system sc bitcoin was supposed to be a way that 
could use it as money to exchange for things on the internet but the actual value of bitcoins has 
fluctuating wildly if you were really really good and bought it very very cheaply early on you could have 
an enormous amount of cash good old american dollars if you had sold it at the right time but 
on its way back down this sound like something that we could reliably use as money but the hype 
not from nowhere reasons why people are very excited about cryptocurrencies so guest is neha narula and the one 
talk to about this neha is the director of the digital currency initiative at mit and an expert on 
only cryptocurrencies but wide scale scalable computing online security things like that so going to actually sit down and 
about what the blockchain is sc this technology that some of you sure are super expert on but other 
you quite know going on so you will by the end of this episode understand the block chain there 
be talk of hash functions a crazy world out there we need to understand some new concepts but okay 
will all make sense after this hour and it matters not just for money but for the future of 
internet which affects us in a number of ways the internet more broadly has gone from this kind of 
west individualistic view that we had back in the say to a set of mega platforms facebook and google 
amazon and twitter that seemed to control an increasing fraction of what goes on online so the same technologies 
are behind crypto currencies might someday help bring back the situation where things were a little bit more individualistic 
little bit more decentralized and that could have crucial impacts on how we use the internet a decade or 
from now so go music sc great neha narula welcome to the mindscape podcast neha narula hello sc gonna 
even more than usual asking the dumbest silliest most straight forward questions because i think gonna talk about sexy 
right cryptocurrencies bitcoin distributed computing on the internet and privacy and things like that and this is very important 
but also stuff where jargon gets in the way very very quickly so not to be embarrassed i want 
play the village idiot and ask silliest questions so start with what is money nn just get right to 
sc yeah get right to the hard ones nn honestly getting more and more convinced by the day that 
one really knows what money is a very very confusing topic and the more i read about it i 
the less i understand which is not a great sign so economists define money as having three qualities it 
a unit of account we use it to price things we say how much things are worth and in 
of money in terms of dollars for example as a medium of exchange so we use money to buy 
to make exchanges to to transact and have an economy sc sure nn and then the third way the 
sort of property that defines money is as a store of value so we use money to store value 
work and get a paycheck we put our paycheck in a savings account money so that we can use 
money for a rainy day so sort of the technical definition of money sc that was excellent by the 
i expect you have quite such a very detailed answer right on the bat but i guess are nn 
is what i do sc i know well is there an economics angle to your sort of training and 
or is it more techno nn great question i am a computer scientist by background and i did not 
any economics training but you kinda have to sort of start to crib a little bit together and so 
would say still very early in that process but i can quote a couple of things that economists might 
sc so been picking it up on street corners along the way nn been trying to yes learn economics 
the sc okay nn that is a great way of describing it i have street level economics so yeah 
to your friendly neighborhood drop out or something like that that been going on so the economist definition which 
one way of looking at it another way of looking at it is money is the way i like 
say talk about it is that money is a story sc okay nn money is a story that we 
ourselves say pulling a twenty dollars bill out of my pocket right now why does this piece of paper 
anything why is it worth anything worth something because we tell a story to each other about why worth 
and we all sort of believe in that story and we interact as though that story is true that 
being that this twenty dollars is worth approximately i know maybe a nice lunch worth of value and if 
give it to you you can go buy a nice lunch somewhere and with that money that person can 
buy something else somewhere so money is a story that we tell each other and all sort agreed to 
certain objects or pieces of paper or ones and zeros in certain databases as accounts for how much money 
all have and we use it to transact sc and very much based on sort of an absurd level 
trust between people never met each other right nn yes sc walk into a store hand a piece of 
and walk out with stuff nn exactly kind of amazing when you think about it right that i can 
with someone never met before might not even like might not trust at all and yet we can have 
transaction and a transaction that would normally require a relationship maybe weapons or something to back it up we 
have a transaction because of things like money and so really a very powerful thing something that society really 
and it facilitates the exchange of value in our economies sc and there is at least this one major 
between the idea of using something for money that has an intrinsic worth like gold or silver or whatever 
using more abstract notions of money nn well gonna push back on you a little bit there because this 
worth thing is actually a really interesting question and a lot of people do see it that way like 
i get it dollar bills those are paper not actually wore something printed on them and why i think 
but gold gold is actually worth something why is gold worth something turtles all the way down is what 
got to say gold does not have intrinsic value which equates to the amount that worth in our society 
yes you can use gold as so in some electronics yes we like to wear gold rings on our 
sometimes but that really gold is another story that we all tell ourselves all decided for a very very 
time that gold is going to be a measure of wealth for us that gonna use it to store 
and so what it is sc well great because i think that actually a theme of many of the 
having is taking ideas that you might naturally think of as very very different and seeing that actually kind 
blurry between them and pointing out that there really any cut and dried thing called intrinsic value different people 
value even on bread or water very differently from each other nn yes yes that is very very true 
have different values to different people things like art of course this is a very incredibly different value to 
people we try to negotiate that using prices and value and things like that but sort of thinking about 
like gold and silver and whatnot they are precious metals that have certain properties that make them convenient to 
as a store of value but that make them inherently valuable sc so in some sense the very idea 
money has a bit of arbitrariness built into nn exactly sc or a bit of convention built into it 
we should be afraid of that we should figure out how to use it is that okay nn yes 
think that we be afraid of it we should acknowledge it a big proponent of acknowledging the truth instead 
trying to ignore it and we should acknowledge it we should note it and we should not try to 
things like other forms of money to a different standard sc right and in fact this morning i have 
share this with the podcast audience out there because at this wonderful little event called ken presents where a 
of people give talks to an interested public and you made a billion dollars this morning within a few 
can you tell us by what magic you did that nn in theory yes i did i obtained a 
high market capitalization so yes i can explain how i did that so previously what done is i had 
about five minutes creating something called a smart contract on something called a cryptocurrency called ethereum sc get there 
okay get there nn so i created my own token out of nowhere basically so i decided that there 
going to be a billion of them i was going to name them neha shares the shares of me 
billion of them and i created them i willed them into existence and sc and they correspond to a 
things out here in the world nn oh no no no sc you just sat down and said nn 
i just sat down and said making up this thing called neha shares and there are a billion of 
and so i deem it to be and nothing so prosaic is actually real things just ridiculous so it 
so happens keeping track of these neha shares somewhere on the internet and then i went in front of 
audience here at ken presents and i said any of you be willing to buy a neha share from 
for one and lo and behold i think there were three people who raised their hands my shares worth 
much but some people are willing to sort of take a chance and with those if i had made 
three sales then given the fact that there are a billion they had shares and i just sold three 
them for dollar the well that gives me a market cap of a billion dollars sc billion dollars right 
nn billion dollars right there sc where you tempted to cash in right away nn i was gonna go 
some vc money actually and see if i could up that a bit yeah sc well again i think 
because it helps tear down a little bit of these artificial distinctions we draw so the same thing could 
said of the stock portfolio in your retirement fund right you say you think worth a certain amount of 
well because you think people would pay you that amount of money for those shares and even if you 
have cash under the mattress you still are trusting that it has some value in some market nn exactly 
reason i like that example so much is because first of all it pokes fun at crazy high market 
of startups or cryptocurrencies or whatever right the last share you sold and you multiply that times the number 
outstanding shares but also yeah it just makes you realize always thought of i used to always think of 
as being sort of static right like if i had a thousand i had a thousand if i spend 
i would have the same amount tomorrow and in fact the world is a bit of a harsh place 
it is actually very difficult to to store value and to really ensure that gonna be worth the same 
tomorrow and so yeah your stock portfolio could crash tomorrow even if storing things in dollars under your mattress 
some great financial calamity and the euro dollar ratio changes dramatically and all of a sudden you import that 
swiss cheese anymore all these things are sort of floating and ephemeral and very difficult to pin down and 
sc and not even unrealistic worries right hyperinflation has been known to wipe out fortunes and when things go 
nn it happens happening right now in different countries yes nn yeah yeah so what are some of the 
with the current system when it comes to money in terms of how useful the consist of cash and 
cards and so forth is in doing the exchanges we wanna do around the world nn yeah so i 
some of definitely problems with payments i think that the bigger problem lies and who happens to hold most 
the wealth in the world and who we live in a pretty unequal society tremendously unequal in particular about 
really large investment banks basically kind of run things sc really nn they move around trillions and trillions of 
worth of value every day and kind of insane when you think about the fact that some people make 
like where to go to college right well i afford that school so gonna go to this other school 
maybe as good for me and talking maybe thousands of dollars of difference or tens of thousands and to 
investment bank a rounding error and so when i started to really unpack what was value what was wealth 
was money realizing that all of this was true just made me think what is going on with our 
systems such that someone can graduate college with tens of or hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt that 
get rid of that puerto rico is suffering from this massive hurricane and owes all this money to its 
the world is just a really strange place and it really made me feel like we needed to kind 
upend things a little bit we really needed to think about our financial system working for us does it 
sense is this the way that we want it to and if the answer to that is no and 
think the answer to that is no then how are we gonna change it sc and you point i 
i was a little bit surprised again not an expert any of these things but to investment banks rather 
amazon and apple and alphabet or petrodollars or russian oligarchs so really the investment things you think where the 
is concentrated in the current system nn i think that they happen to have a lot of power in 
current system yes i think that they do a lot of expertise as well yeah i think when talking 
we can talk about google and apple and facebook and all the problems with their platforms and user data 
those are really big problems too sc yeah we will okay good nn those are also really big problems 
maybe this technology has a chance of affecting i know one thing at a time we fix the whole 
right at once sc so what do you think okay so problems with that obviously inequality i completely agree 
you also problems i gather in certain parts of the world or whatever just sort of friction in the 
too much of a barrier to using cash in the easy way that used to here in the us 
example nn yeah definitely so i think a lot of places in the world where people just quite simply 
access to digital financial services it just exist one of my colleagues like to talk about a place in 
america where someone had to get in a canoe and canoe really far to get to a town and 
the bank was open maybe it open and it was just this really arduous horrible experience to get access 
financial services like loans and savings accounts and digital payments and things like that so that is definitely a 
huge problem i think that the general statistic thrown around is that there are about two billion unbanked people 
the world so an issue some people like to use the word unbanked because it implies the people should 
banked sc right nn and not clear but the basic ideas have access to financial services that might be 
for them that might help them improve the quality of their lives nn so a major major problem and 
reason that these people have access to these financial services is because no institution has daned to give them 
right and there are different reasons for that it might be incredibly expensive in order to reach these people 
also might be the case that too confusing to understand how to value the creditworthiness of the these people 
there are a lot of different reasons but the simple fact of the matter is no access and i 
we need to change that sc alright so identified the problems what are we gonna do about them you 
the leader of a digital currency initiative as i take it and so maybe your answer has something to 
with digital currencies nn yeah i might just have something to do with digital currencies so to be clear 
i wanna stay this up front not that i necessarily think that this is the absolute answer to all 
these problems that is probably not true more that i think it might be part of an answer to 
problems and even that is to me a good enough reason to work on it and to try to 
this stuff happen heard a lot of stories about people who have used cryptocurrency to solve some of their 
and the stories have been very moving actually people at this point in time most of the stories i 
are they fall into one of two categories one category is i earn money in one country and i 
to put it in another country and by using something like bitcoin able to do that much more cheaply 
i would otherwise so remittances cross border sc okay nn that type of use case the other use case 
i hear about is people from countries where their currency is under capital controls or getting hyperinflated and this 
them a means of taking the wealth that accumulated and getting it out before it disappears so about wealth 
sc do you have a specific moving story that you have in mind when thinking about this nn great 
so in the first category there was a gentleman who lives in works and nigeria and needs to come 
boston occasionally and there just really a great way for him to move money every month from nigerian currency 
american currency it was complicated and extremely expensive and it just it work and bitcoin and was a solution 
him for the wealth side of things i have a friend who runs a cryptocurrency company called zappo and 
argentina and so he went through he saw that happening in argentina and it was really powerful for him 
he really saw a lot of potential in cryptocurrency and why he works on it today sc alright so 
the point where you now have to tell us what a cryptocurrency is what bitcoin is something called the 
nn we have danced around it sc tune in for this yes here we are nn so great question 
where do we start i like to start with a bitcoin because how it started and chronologically i think 
a pretty good to way try to describe it so in a this shadowy figure on the internet known 
as satoshi nakamoto sent an email to a mailing list and said hey i have this idea and calling 
bitcoin and satoshi nakamoto he she they we have no idea who this person or persons who they are 
released a white paper describing bitcoin explaining and the idea behind it and the idea behind it was peertopeer 
without any bank or government or other institution facilitating those payments peertopeer digital payments sc very neal stephenson right 
science fiction novel like some shadowy figure who no one knows what they are starts a revolution nn it 
gonna make such a great movie one day i wait for the movie a version of this aaron sorkin 
listening laughter sc alright aaron give us a call have your people contact us nn think about it think 
it so right so then a few months later satoshi actually produced working code satoshi said programmed this here 
is running it if you would like you can run it too and we will be part of the 
network and that will be bitcoin and so people in this mailing list like this is kind of neat 
fine oh and by the way if you run this you get bitcoin just by running it your gonna 
and try to solve a little problem and every time it solves the problem first gonna get a bit 
bitcoin and so people started doing it they started this process is called mining they started mining bitcoin and 
this progressed for about three years or so i would say nn and or maybe it was two years 
a few years it was just sort of this toy it was this weird thing that some people on 
internet were playing with and were using and were liking and actually this goes back to the stories they 
all telling themselves a sort of story about it right this was an unhackable form of money this was 
that no one could take from you it was purely based on mathematics it was a very pure form 
internet money and then what happened next was and this also happened on the internet some guy i said 
i would like to buy two pizzas if you send me two pizzas i will send you forty thousand 
and this is known as the first exchange of bitcoin for something of actual value the first time someone 
something with bitcoin sc two pizzas nn two pizzas forty thousand bitcoin sc brilliant nn yeah sc why am 
not on these mailing lists laughter nn so it happened somebody in london sent this guy two pizzas he 
in florida and he sent him the other guy forty thousand bitcoin which not talk about how much worth 
amount of money tens of millions of dollars laughter sc but those pizzas were delicious nn yes i think 
was papa johns laughter sc ah well sorry nn so that was the first time that yeah bitcoin was 
exchanged for something and that was the first time that you could really say is how much a worth 
the cost of a pizza divided by and then it just sort of went on this crazy ride of 
value and losing value and it was all about the story of the bitcoin and it for and how 
we use it and what does it mean and since then been even more cryptocurrencies i think there are 
of them out there right now and in part a lot of that is about experimentation people trying out 
ideas trying to see what makes these things work and what makes what work but going back to the 
about okay bitcoin cryptocurrency what is a blockchain well in paper satoshi talked about a chain of blocks and 
now i understand laughter nn oh yeah totally just a chain of blocks right makes so much more sense 
bitcoin coin made of bits duh laughter so confusing about all of this so satoshi talked about the structure 
this ledger so the idea behind bitcoin was remember satoshi said running this code anybody else wanna run it 
it is anybody could download and run this code anybody you could download and run it right now still 
case anybody can download and run this code join the network and start being a part of bitcoin sc 
the code to do what nn well the code to try to create blocks and to download the blocks 
people have created check them to make sure correct and sort of facilitate the transfer of your bitcoin sc 
so is there one blockchain for each currency so one blockchain for bitcoin nn kind of so at heart 
blockchain is a data structure a ledger of transactions bitcoin has its own blockchain one blockchain for bitcoin however 
called forking basically someone can decide to divide the network up and basically create a copy of bitcoin new 
new ledger another blockchain sc speciation a biologist would call it right nn yes like a creature just divides 
into two basically what happens so then another blockchain and this has happened to bitcoin several times a few 
of it bitcoin cash bitcoin gold bitcoin platinum da da da on and on sc okay nn in addition 
that there are other cryptocurrencies that do have their own blockchains like ethereum is another one lightcoin is another 
zcash is another one and then this is where it gets really confusing there are ways of building tokens 
top of other blockchains so this is actually really common with ethereum and this is what i did in 
talk this morning at the conference where we are you ethereum is a little bit different than bitcoin whereas 
ledger of transactions ethereum is kind of more like a global computer it it just handle transactions which make 
it handles something called smart contracts which are like little programs so you can write a little program and 
it on the ethereum blockchain and then that little program we execute and so one very very popular type 
program is one in which you can create your own token sc and a token nn and the token 
just like those neha shares or something that someone makes up digital it exist in the real world hopefully 
limited amount of them that are an issue in schedule controlled programmatically and like a digital credit just sometimes 
in a context where the idea is that supposed to correspond to something sc right i was gonna say 
some point just like the pizza is they have to be assigned value nn yes yes and so sometimes 
by again the story we all tell ourselves that has a happens with money and sometimes done because somebody 
of behind it saying token is gonna be worth for example starbucks points might be thought of as tokens 
these are airline frequent flier points sc frequent flier miles nn yeah exactly so there are a lot of 
these days who are developing their own networks and are creating tokens to go along with those networks and 
of suggesting that people will buy tokens in order to use whatever service that network provides sc okay this 
great and i wanna come back to it but i definitely wanna get this block chain stuff completely understood 
in some sense of just take the particular block chain for your favorite bitcoin fork just one block chain 
a set of ones and zeros a file except not just one file to file that exist many computers 
once nn yes sc is that right nn yes sc and whenever any transaction happens with bitcoin you add 
to file right nn yes sc and then a way of sort of checking that no cheating nn yes 
is exactly what happens so this computer network is every computer in it every soft every node in the 
is keeping a file just like you said and that is an append only file and what you do 
you add transactions that to the end of that file and that file is a copy of a ledger 
maintaining together the reason called a block chain in particular is because instead of adding transactions one at a 
you group them together in a set and then you just stick the set on to the end of 
file and called a block a block of transaction so i was just sort of like a batching mechanism 
just put them together in one chunk the reason a chain is because each set of transactions each block 
to the one before it so like this list like a link list in computer science terminology and what 
serves to do is it makes the blockchain tamperproof you go back in time and fiddle with the transactions 
if you do gonna mess up all the pointers and the pointers gonna work out correctly anymore and gonna 
very obvious to everyone gonna notice it sc and also everyone else and if you try to do anything 
the block chain is just automatic that file updates nn great question so this is where this process called 
comes in so in and bitcoin in particular in order to create a new block a new set of 
i myself for example might be doing this gonna gather a bunch of transactions together stick them in a 
and then try to solve a random numeric puzzle what gonna do sc and this was idea right nn 
was idea this was idea he or she or they had this idea that what will happen is i 
to think about all sit there and our computers will spin trying different random numbers and the way i 
to think about this problem is imagine you lets say you have ten dice okay and gonna throw the 
and say you throw the dice once maybe a repeated a couple of times but probably gonna get sort 
a random assortment and numbers each time now say i told you if you throw those ten dice and 
get all sixes then you win the game winning the game kind of the puzzle that trying to solve 
their computer like throwing dice generating random numbers until that number looks a certain way and once they do 
they publish their answer and people check it to make sure that they actually did this right and that 
the process by which several different things happen first of all that set of blocks needs that special random 
attached to it in order to be a valid block in the block chain and then a second the 
that i generated that random number allows me to create new bitcoin out of nowhere according to a schedule 
is set in the computer program and this is the process known as mining bitcoin who mining sc who 
up the puzzle who knows what the right answer is is it unknown or is it universal nn everyone 
sort of the sketch of the problem right and actually something called the preimage of a so there are 
things called hash functions in cryptography and what they do is they take a large amount of data and 
map it on to a fingerprint so a way of sort of finger printing data now when you do 
the finger print comes out looking sort of random okay sc by finger print we mean a set of 
on a piece of paper we need some ones and zeros once again laughter a long number nn we 
ones and zeroes we mean another little chunk of data yes another chunk of data so you take a 
chunk of data like a pdf or an email or a picture and you feed it through this hash 
and what comes out the other end is a short string that is very uniquely tied to that piece 
data you put inside sc and shorter than the original nn much much it can be much much shorter 
the original sc okay nn it could be the same size as the original and so what this does 
it serves to sort like if i take a picture and i put it through a hash function and 
and create this sort of hash that describes the picture that summarize in a way then that means if 
show me a different picture i can hash it and see that the hashes will turn out different so 
functions are used to uniquely identify big chunks of data why i call them a finger print because the 
is kind of like a unique representation of me sc except sorry to keep interrupting but if a big 
gets hashed into a small file then it follow that multiple big files will give you the same small 
nn yea now you gotta get into the details sean sc physicist yeah nn yes this is very true 
is absolutely absolutely true in fact it is the case that for any sort of single hash or fingerprint 
are many many many many many things that will hash to that thing sc okay nn but a property 
a hash function is that it is extraordinarily difficult to find something so just given the short string the 
the fingerprint it is very difficult for me to work backwards from that to something that will hash to 
value that difficult problem is exactly going on with bitcoin mining so happening is your trying different strings over 
over and over again to see if they produce the right kind of fingerprint sc okay nn in fact 
a short string with a lot of zeros at the front at this point in time i think given 
way bitcoin mining works you need a you need about seventy zeros in the front actually a really hard 
thing to do sc but someone knows the hash function nn so everybody knows the hash function the hash 
called shot sc i see inverting it nn inverting it is you can know the hash function and that 
still invert it very easily sc and this is just a miracle of nn this is a really cool 
of math and cryptography yes and so one who picked shot two hundred fiftysix as the particular hash function 
we were gonna use for bitcoin sc good and so when so the mining that we always hear about 
it used to be individuals on their laptops now is gigantic farms in china and elsewhere chugging through little 
finger prints trying to reconstruct what they were hashing nn yes and worth talking about that a little bit 
so when satoshi started he or she or they thought oh great everyone will run this on their computers 
computers are pretty powerful you can check a bunch of different combinations of data to see if they produce 
right hash and then we all rent bitcoin together on our computers now what ended up happening is that 
people realized that it was possible to develop specialized hardware that could do this faster than laptops and if 
could do it faster that means that they had a better chance of finding the answer first and winning 
bitcoin that comes out of this process and so this kind of started an arms race of crazy hardware 
and now there are these machines called asics application specific integrated circuits that can solve this problem millions of 
faster than your laptop can and basically you mine in the bitcoin network effectively unless you have one of 
machines and different crypto currencies actually use slightly different hash functions so if somebody use shot others use different 
and very interesting because in video a lot of people have been buying gpus to mine cryptocurrency and so 
video was like buying all of our gpus and going on the price going up sc this is the 
circuit company right the card company nn yeah yeah they make the graphics processing unit that goes on your 
is frequently used for gaming you need to buy like a fancy gpu in order to render your video 
nicely sc and shoot the bad guys nn and so lo and behold cryptocurrency enthusiast are competing with gamers 
driving up the prices of gpus which i find very funny sc two very devoted fan bases for different 
but okay that was extremely helpful but bring it back down so the so this is how we so 
do we call it when we successful mine we got a bitcoin nn you mined a block sc you 
a block nn yes yes sc okay and what is stored on any individual computer in the network is 
entire block chain right nn the whole thing yeah sc so in the spirit of asking the dumb questions 
really big nn about a one hundred fifty gigabytes right now sc pretty big nn a pretty big you 
have to store the whole thing you just kind of need to get it and verify it and then 
you catch up good you can kind of throw it away sc okay nn so that you have to 
it forever you just have to process it also it is entirely possible the thing you have to remember 
this space is that still pretty early on sc sure nn still at the beginning bitcoin was the first 
and yes in bitcoin you have to keep a history of every transaction that ever existed but people working 
really cool ideas that let you do things like keep a constant amount of space that proves that looked 
every transaction ever existed and verified it so the way i like to think about this i like making 
analogy to cars so in the early cars were very good clunky very slow used a lot of gas 
were faster than cars but they got better very very very quickly and i think cryptocurrencies are kind of 
same way yeah a lot of problems right now but still working on them and i think i see 
in sight sc and this drives home the message that we started with really so mined a bitcoin well 
find a block and you get rewarded with some bitcoin when that happens and basically i could translate that 
you have solved a math puzzle your nvidia card on a computer has solved a math puzzle and the 
of the world agrees to then exchange some little information you have for money nn yes sc and of 
the amount of money seems to change from day to day but basically it you have this piece of 
that verifies that you solved this puzzle and give you hundreds of dollars for that nn well give i 
right now bitcoin for that yes sc okay however many dollars that is might change by the time this 
is published nn you would definitely get some bitcoin yes sc yes okay and so what makes this so 
a way for people around the world to agree on some token worth some value why is that better 
good old american dollars nn great question i think both pretty great sc okay nn not one or the 
so first of all one thing that immediately obvious to me but i realized later was bitcoin was the 
time that people made digital payments without a bank sc without a bank nn without a bank sc a 
point like almost going back to bartering nn it is going back to something very sort of peer to 
very sort you need this very highly regulated structured institution that does very specific things in the middle you 
that anymore you can do digital payments without a bank so that in itself is pretty cool you probably 
well so what digital payments through banks they seem to work fine survived this long and i think that 
true in a lot of cultures and a lot of different societies digital payments through credit cards and banks 
fine the fee we have to pay is kind of annoying well actually merchants pay it and then they 
it on to us we think we pay fees for credit cards but actually paying for it in the 
that we buy the fee around could it be lower i know maybe cryptocurrencies could help push that feel 
little lower but not really groundbreaking right saying like a percent here and there but i think what really 
kind of groundbreaking is going back to what we were talking about earlier there are so many people in 
world who just have access to digital financial services and this is a way that if they can get 
internet connection they have access nn bam done they need a bank to sign them up they need to 
or they have to have a minimum deposit size or a certain type of identification they can just start 
it which is kind of neat and reminds me very much of another piece of technology which is sort 
what we call permission less which is the internet and another thing where you can kind of just start 
it sc and just to get excuse me the technical detail right here as i understand it if you 
some cryptocurrencies in bitcoin or ethereum or whatever you have a number that supposed to not lose and if 
lose it lost no longer yours and the number i read on the internet was twenty dollars billion dollars 
estimated to have been misplaced by people losing their addresses what are they called what is the phrase for 
nn the private key sc private key right nn yeah yeah yeah still figuring this all out not ready 
prime time i keep trying to tell people this sc nope okay fine nn absolutely right so yeah so 
is called public key cryptography and it was actually invented in the and it was invented at mit a 
i work with occasionally named ron rivest was pretty critical in its invention and it actually used on the 
in so many different places public key cryptography is critical for security for hiding information and for proving the 
of information so the way that used in cryptocurrencies is as follows people have a private key and a 
key and you can generate these on your computer so sort of randomly you kind of throw some randomness 
there and you get these two numbers out and they work together so normally when i log on to 
service on the internet i type in my password right so my password is something that i should keep 
not supposed to show to anybody except supposed to type it into a form and then send it over 
internet to this company nn the way a password works a this is not how public key cryptography works 
the way that this works is i have two pieces of information public and private the private one i 
share with anybody i never ever ever not supposed to ever give anyone my private key i use my 
key to either digitally sign things so like producing a signature or to encrypt things digitally encrypt things meaning 
of mask them and then people use the public counterpart to that my public key to either validate that 
signature came from me or to encrypt stuff for me so actually use my private key to decrypt things 
this is how these two pieces are used together a very different way of thinking very different and so 
when working with a company or a website on the internet if you lose your password no problem you 
call them up you can click the password reset button though reset your account for you sc you have 
remember the street you grew up on or whatever your first cat nn exactly they have all sorts of 
questions they will ask you to confirm you but they have a way to reset your password to give 
access back to your account a company with the list of all the accounts and they can do that 
can go into their database and they can just flip something around with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin no company right 
computers are running these things this distributed decentralized system and so if you lose your private key gonna be 
to give that back to you and nobody can reset your account for you kind of the point and 
yeah kind of out of luck if you happen to lose it or someone steals it they can steal 
money which is kind of a bummer sc but still in the process of setting up what will be 
more user friendly interfaces for all of us nn yeah and i think just to talk about that a 
i think be layered so yes at the bottom layer there will be sort of this public private key 
and if you ultimately lose sometimes you can actually use multiple keys so you can kind of keep them 
different places so you can give your dad one and your brother another one and then they can reconstruct 
for you like sort of techniques that you can use to make this problem a little less bad and 
will happen is i think yeah be companies that figure out how to use these techniques and then offer 
service to users the users will use these companies to intermediate their access to the cryptocurrency sc and places 
coinbase are trying to do this roughly speaking nn yeah so exactly so coinbase is probably the biggest cryptocurrency 
so that you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies to coinbase and this is a large part of what they 
they try to make it easy for users so you have to worry about public keys and private keys 
thing is is that when you hold cryptocurrency through a company like coinbase not actually holding it yourself holding 
you have an account at coinbase a little bit more like a bank accont sc like a bank but 
but not sort of governmental currency that is ultimately nn but the cryptocurrency yeah sc yeah exactly and i 
a lot of people get confused between the difference between thinking of these cryptocurrencies as investment instruments versus actual 
you use to make payments and in fact still not that easy to pay for things using bitcoin or 
right nn oh very difficult kind of annoying actually yes done it sc and people invest in them and 
may or may not be a good idea nn yeah well i think a few different things going on 
really is first of all there are digital payments and that was kind of the pitch of bitcoin in 
beginning was is a new form of making digital but kind of a slow system for digital payments i 
new technology coming gonna make things a lot faster but not quite here yet so still in its infancy 
then also this idea of remember we were talking about nehashers and me showing my own token kind of 
notion of like why can i just issue shares in myself or shares in my right why i just 
that out of nowhere and allow you to invest in it you get a share you get a promise 
i think these ideas are connected in a way because all about sort of disentangling the instruments of finance 
trusted institutions and the very intense regulation that goes around those institutions about breaking that apart and reimagining how 
might do these things if we so encumbered right sc what i mostly want is a way to charge 
ten cents every time they listen to a podcast episode is that something that the digital currencies will help 
or do we nn i think so i think getting closer to that yes there so one of the 
problems with bitcoin is it kinda has high fees you still have to pay fees to use it sc 
exactly so still friction in this system even though that was the whole promise nn and part of the 
for that is going back to it remember storing a copy of this ledger so when i create my 
little transaction it gets stored thousands of times around the world which is kind of a little excessive i 
if it needs to be stored that many times and costly it costs money to pay for the bandwith 
move that around to pay for the disk space to store it to pay for the cpu to validate 
and so for good reason a little bit pricier to create a bitcoin transaction there are really interesting solutions 
down the pipeline to help make all of that much much much much cheaper and really excited about this 
i think it will make it so that you can very easily take one time ten cent payments no 
sc cool nn or even maybe what you should do is you should charge people like a cent per 
of podcast they listen to sc oh be awesome alright now you have dollar signs bitcoin signs flashing from 
eyes nn yes if really interested keep going keep paying you can you can put all the juicy stuff 
the end sc well so what would you been a lot of hype right a lot of speculation a 
of promise about these things i can see how once things are up and running a little bit more 
these kinds of currencies will help people in different parts of the world to get access to money or 
more than access to money access to finance access to the ability to do things with this kind of 
and hopefully the friction will be less hopefully the transaction cost will be less so what is the biggest 
you see that this might change the world if being in your most optimistic mood nn oh boy okay 
sc so we hold you to it nn yeah sort well okay start with something abstract so the goal 
i work on and that my group works on is we wanna create what we call the internet of 
what the internet did for information we wanna do for the transfer of value and so what i think 
terms of platforms and infrastructure and so i wanna create the platforms and infrastructure so that people can build 
which move around value and sort of transform value and create contracts and things like that so i wanna 
the infrastructure that will let you really really easily with a few lines of code or a service or 
start to take payments for your podcast like tiny little micro payments for your podcast so i think that 
that infrastructure i even know what people are gonna do with it but i think it could be really 
similarly to the ways with the internet we really know what people were gonna do about it we know 
it was gonna sort of facilitate arab spring or to change the outcome of an election in the united 
or all the things that it did sc i met my wife through the internet nn oh great sc 
read each blogs and how we got to know each other yeah nn really sc yeah yeah nn how 
apart were you guys sc i was in chicago and she was in washington dc nn and what was 
about her blog sc well this was the early gogo days of blogging in general and there that many 
blogs on the internet and most of them were written by physicists who are not very good writers so 
is a professional writer and so she was writing about physics in a much more charming way than most 
so i said hi and we exchanged questions about how to be a good blogger and so forth then 
it turned out that we were gonna appear at the same physics conference in a few weeks twelve years 
nn the rest is history sc yeah happily married happily married yeah nn adorable you met on the internet 
if the internet sc a big fan of the internet i think good nn you know a sc i 
like twitter i think the only one but i think good yeah nn i also like twitter a love 
relationship definitely but lots of love there too yeah so internet bringing people together sc exactly nn love is 
of the things that could come out of this so abstractly what really interested in when it comes to 
specifics i get a little bit more sort of i know i think access is just a really big 
giving people access to financial services letting them build all sorts of crazy types of things with them and 
a very dystopian view so something i really worry about a lot are micropayments and what kinds of things 
might facilitate so to give you an example right now a lot of stuff that we just get for 
because not really feasible to charge for it right so sitting on a park bench or a water fountain 
things like that a lot of sort of really like public infrastructure sc i see where this is going 
yeah this could get bad you wanna charge a cent per second of your podcast what if someone wants 
start charging who knows what tolls for example what if you always paid tolls and like every single mile 
drove on whatever road and everything sort of varied and it was very much like sort of this varied 
and the way that sort of plane tickets kinda operate right now where people are charged three different prices 
on time and availability and it just feels really unfair it feels really weird to have that happen in 
society so i worry that if we create a world toward taking payments and charging for things it just 
orders of magnitude easier than what that might do a little scary sc so saying that the ability to 
people to do anything has downsides nn oh yeah yeah sc alright i can see that nn sometimes i 
is money really a good thing is owning property really a good thing i know i start to get 
little crazy yeah these like things start getting a sc but to remedy that maybe we can talk about 
money this bigger philosophy of decentralization and on the internet in particular and i know that you thought about 
a little bit money is an example where a central authority who prints the money and decides what the 
is the internet was originally maybe at least in our retelling of it sort of wild west libertarian frontier 
individuals ruggedly did their thing and now ever more there are gatekeepers there are sort of mega platforms that 
everything is is the blockchain technology something that can move us back toward a more individualistic approach or should 
just do that anyway regardless of the role of the watching nn yeah a great question so the internet 
the internet definitely has this mythology attached to it of oh anybody in the beginning anyone could run a 
anyone could put their content up it was findable by anyone very much like that lovely story about you 
your wife and how you met you both put your content out there sc we did nn and you 
each other right you have to be friends on facebook it was just you found each other through your 
and that was sort of the promise of the internet and now it is all mediated by these giant 
and actually done quite a bit of thinking and writing about this topic because there is a big push 
quote unquote redecentralize the web and what does that mean that means lots of different things so first of 
people are very worried about the power that these centralized platforms have over our society over public discourse algorithmic 
in the ways that they operate their censorship and people sort of feel trapped this feeling like i really 
facebook but i really have any other option where all my friends are and so what am i gonna 
where i see photos of my nephew if not on sc what it means to be a monopoly nn 
and i think really when you look at the way that cryptocurrencies operate there is the protocol is very 
not about monopolies about users individuals owning their own data and so people are applying those ideas to the 
in general and so been a big push to think about data portability what does that mean that means 
put a lot of content onto these services i should be able to get it out whenever i want 
the click of a button and i should be able to move of it so if someone develops face 
i know some other competitor to facebook some new social network i should be able to move my data 
of facebook bam into this other thing with the click of a button and i should be able another 
of next step of that interoperability is even if on a different social network i should still be able 
interact with the people who stayed behind on the other social network sc this is sounding very utopian right 
nn it is sc compared to the present nn yes it it was the original idea behind the internet 
was that we would use these interoperable protocols and so everybody would be able to talk to everybody else 
i think this it does sound a little bit like a pipe dream given the way that things work 
now but people are trying to push things in this direction sc and is the block chain playing a 
there or is it simply sort of philosophically aligned nn so some people will say that the blockchain can 
a role there i not convinced of that i think more of the inspiration sc right but somehow the 
technology goes hand in hand with the idea of privacy security being able to be ourselves be recognized as 
and that might help right nn yeah well so a few different things at play here so first of 
the public key cryptography i was talking about is a way of me identifying myself that require any sort 
central registry necessarily i can kind of a consistent sort of it can be a consistent digital identity so 
until you lose it nn yeah until someone steals it or you lose it a whole other conversation to 
to have so kind of an idea of like i have a digital identity that is separate from these 
and then another idea is this idea of decentralization and in particular no central body all coordinating together all 
on this together and all figuring it out this together because you have to realize the way that cryptocurrencies 
bitcoin work is no fence around them not the case with most sort of systems when you think about 
them you think gonna be a firewall or perimeter and gonna keep hackers out not gonna let the hackers 
but if the hackers get in if they cross the perimeter all bets are with bitcoin no perimeter anybody 
get in at any time bitcoin invites the hackers in so to speak the hackers are in there all 
out with you right but designed in such a way that by using digital signatures and by creating this 
game of mining the hackers be able to spend my money and they will be incentivized to participate in 
productive way instead of attacking the system sc so it sounds there was a time very very brief when 
were not only blogs but then there were rss readers nn yes i remember that sc so you could 
only person jennifer and i are the only people who still use our rss readers nn you still use 
sc every day yeah nn i try occasionally and just give up sc and for people who are too 
to know what this was you would have blogs or other news services or whatever and they would have 
feed and you could choose what sources to let into your feed so i can read both my friends 
and the new york times in the same platform and you could imagine a way better version of that 
technology has not been improved really for a decade that was the equivalent of facebook and twitter and the 
york times and your pictures and whatever and there was also nn and controlled by you sc right and 
i think that what people realized is this is not a way to make money right nn yea sc 
the present system and i think one thing i think the other thing is of course a slight level 
technological sophistication is required to jump into that and navigate it effectively and facebook for all its terribleness made 
really easy for everyone to go in and post their pictures nn yeah this is a big problem with 
systems they are very hard to use and if no giant company sitting in the middle of it making 
ton of money paying for the ui designers and these are experienced engineers and the people who are gonna 
sort of make this thing work right sc and as an empirical matter you can try to crowdsource it 
those are not the issues that are often most of interest to the people coding away for free in 
publicly sourced thing nn very true sc right so linux as much as we love it is just not 
userfriendly as mac os or whatever nn yeah yeah yeah a little worrisome sc and another related thing before 
forget is you mentioned this morning electric voting electronic voting right nn mmhmm sc will these kinds of technologies 
make that more secure nn well it depends on what you mean by these types of technologies sc so 
meaning like i sit at my laptop and i can vote i really to go in nn right or 
on my mobile phone or something like that the dream right like i take out my phone and i 
i have to stand in line i have to worry about sort of checking to make sure i register 
people turning me away so some of these technologies yes will be extremely helpful for electronic voting cryptography using 
private key pairs and things like that but the big push that heard about is applying blockchain technology to 
and actually very skeptical about that at least right now the thing with electronic voting is that so important 
voting is critically important and the thing with paper is that kind of hard to hack paper at scale 
so perfected technology paper nn yeah it really is quite difficult to affect all the paper in a really 
country at the same time you kinda have but considerably easier to electronically change things even in a wide 
area at one time if you hack the system if you find a flaw if you find a way 
and so with electronic voting kind of opening up your attack surface quite a bit now not just about 
voting machines about the phone that voting on the computer voting on your internet connection from your house so 
different things the entire software stack of running so many things that if a bug in any one of 
things your vote could be compromised so we really have to be very very careful about getting it right 
blockchain technology help with any of that endpoint stuff it help make sure that i install some weird piece 
software sitting there fiddling with my vote blockchain technologies do anything about that and so i just think solving 
right the real problems sc there was this brilliant xkcd cartoon as they so often are recently that was 
to an airline technician or an airplane technician and they will say seems unsafe to be in an airplane 
can crash but really super duper safe way more safe a car technician same thing and then an electronic 
software developer like ever use this for anything this is incredibly subject to being nn exactly and i think 
you talk to the experts in the space they will all say this they will all say no no 
try to use like of all a startup do you really wanna start up developing mission critical infrastructure for 
country no no no no no only existed for like six months and who are these people that this 
you want something super vetted and audited and really really really secure looked at by everybody so i understand 
know people are very frustrated with voting and they really want to increase access and i very much understand 
problem in that question i just i wanna urge caution sc is there what about the social side of 
individuality aspect if everyone controls their own feed if everyone makes their own internet do we worry about political 
kind of questions hacking by bots stuff like that we just very recently had the incidents where alex jones 
various conspiracy theorists and nazis have been kicked off of certain mega platforms is that the good side of 
mega platforms that they can control that nn exactly this is something that also thought about and written about 
little bit so there is an alternative to twitter called mastodon it is a federated form of twitter very 
you might wanna get on sc not that hip yeah i should become more hip mastodon nn so mastodon 
sort of a federated twitter and by that i mean different people run different mastodon instances and so but 
all interoperate you can subscribe to people in these different instances but the idea is if somebody kicks you 
of one you can just get on another one a bit harder to censor guess what these things are 
grounds for the type of things that get kicked off of twitter which are not really very savory sorts 
things sc mostly yeah nn yeah and so sort of the counterpoint to censorship resistant technology that means that 
really censor things that may be even as a society we would want censored sc so aside from what 
think should happen or worry about what might happen what do you think will happen i just remember in 
mid when web pages first began to become a thing mosaic and netscape and so forth and i was 
very early adopter for these things i got very excited and i could not explain to my friends why 
was excited like sure this is gonna be really they say what is it good and i said look 
can get a photograph of whether the coffee machine has coffee in it or and like is not worth 
talking but of course we use the internet for a lot now probably many of the applications are gonna 
unanticipated i guess nn yes and please ask me to anticipate them i feel exactly the same way that 
do like look i did this cool thing where i wrote this transaction that did this weird thing and 
is that sc why do i care nn need yeah and just the sense that something neat here something 
we can do here that we do before and i know how gonna do it but a platform people 
build a million things on top of it and some of those things will be super amazing and cool 
alright neha narula come back ten years from now and have a good laugh at what we thought the 
was gonna be thanks so much for being on the podcast nn thank you you got the pizza story 
wrong the actual event as it happened pingback sean carrolls mindcast podcast neha narula on blockchain cryptocurrency and the 
of the internet three quarks daily you here too many people talk about the value of money as it 
to a time which is arguably the one thing we all can agree is extremely valuable to us all 
would argue the value of a dollar is underwritten by our minimum wage in otherwords a dollar is worth 
understood value of an hour of a time regardless of their knowledge skills or productive output but that is 
my humble opinion you here too many people talk about the value of money as it relates to a 
which is arguably the one thing we all can agree is extremely valuable to us all i would argue 
value of a dollar is related to our minimum wage in otherwords a dollar is worth the understood value 
an hour of a time regardless of their knowledge skills or productive output but that is just my humble 
a few observations first nobody ever seems to refer to neal hilarious book that prefigures bitcoin here a group 
computer geeks come up with a regulation free digital currency and mayhem ensues the flashbacks in the hefty tome 
alan turing et al during wwii are very interesting the problem in the book for the inventors is the 
web aspect of things in real life bitcoin has already featured in payoffs for computer hijacks and the like 
a past life in banking i know that even us and uk banks are often unwitting players in shady 
but cryptocash could be even worse the kyc and aml references that went unexplained in the podcast stand for 
your customer and antimoney laundering rules for banks these rules try to control illegal payments these are far from 
and often a pain for legit customers but better than nothing of course the difficulty of actually using digital 
to pay for anything us a more effective control right now in hampering widespread use than any regulations but 
if you do succeed in usingsay bitcoin to buy something you completed the transaction swapped one asset for another 
you may be liable for a capital gains tax if the bitcoin you used was swapped for more than 
paid for it if you mined it your tax basis might be deemed zero alternatively the tax guys could 
you liable for capital gains tax but disallow you offsets on capital losses they could also fiddle with longshort 
rates it would be a complete filing nightmare if made more than a few transactions in bitcoin or you 
not report the activity and be subject to bigger problems if caught plus holding large values in cryptocash has 
own dangers the rise of asicsbased mining shows how things can change rsabased assets may not survive algorithm on 
computers where no offline backup system friction fragility and complexity are still going to compromise trust in the cryptostory 
number of cryptocash scams running right now is amusing if you stay away from them one i just saw 
sweden moving all its currency into cryptokronas cryptocrap the basic idea cryptocurrency idea has promise but real not virtual 
right now buying bitcoin a while back was a good idea buying it today is a speculative investment you 
do ok but you could also walk away without even a tulip bulb great episode but i found it 
that the immense negative environmental impact of proofofwork cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin even glancingly you asked what money is 
explained mining of cryptocurrencies but you failed to explain that of all money currently is created as credit by 
banks that is were a lot of the problems with our banking system come from i thought every smart 
on earth did their research on that after the banking crisis in damnit sean disappointed at one point you 
hinted that money was created centralized which is simply not true currently you need an institution with a banking 
aka bank and someone willing to go into debt willing to borrow money from that bank and that bank 
to agree to it aka think that you have enough creditworthyness for the amount you want to borrow and 
that bank needs to hold a minor percentage about afaik of all their outstanding loans as reserves in central 
money with their central bank or certain securities that are declared by the central bank to be acceptable as 
when a bank gives a loan that money is created out of thin air and neither the central bank 
any branch of government has a hand in it when like or so of outstanding loans a bank has 
out go sour are unretrievable those central bank reserves get wiped out so to speak and that bank goes 
which happened in two thousand eight with a few banks and would have happened with pretty much all of 
etc but that is another there are money reform movements in a lot of countries all over the world 
to get their lawmakers to take back the privilege of money creation from the private banking sector to the 
in switzerland their even was a plebiscite on that which sadly the reform movement lost by a wide margin 
the banks give that up without a fight because it is their main business model collecting interest on money 
created out of thin air selling debt contracts should never have been allowed no matter how sliced up they 
at least you need to force the banks to keep the risks they created for themselves which they had 
have a look at in the first place when they decided to give a loan etc this whole system 
bringing money into existence today that practically is borrowed from your future self with the help of a institution 
works when everybody in the process is held responsible for his actions acts in a responsible manner google for 
money or monetative if you are from germany or switzerland for more information there is a case to be 
that the things new money is used for and the interest gathered during the process should be in the 
interest and not in the hands of a few private banks as the new money dilutes the money supply 
now but only brings with it products and services only in the future if successfully put to use to 
fair your guest hinted at pointed at the role of investment banks in the current system and the insane 
of money that are sometimes involved in the ipos of startups etc she just explain the whole process very 
which in my understanding again actually is the creation of money through credit so when investment banks they quite 
do that by finding firms or investors for whom they can create money out of thin air by there 
waves of mergers and acquisitions done with credit freshly created money in segments of the economy where there yet 
oligopole where the margins are thin because of too much competition they pick out players that seem promising and 
them to take over their competitors so afterwards there often is an oligopole which can extort more money from 
customers suppliers own workforce etc we call that so the debt can be paid back with interest same with 
startups with credit freshly creating money for them and then recouping the money through drummed up stockmarket speculation doing 
when there seems to be a technology entering a field it can be introduced with tons and tons of 
created money credit when an investment bank has trust in a player and businessplan and can drum up enough 
interest in the stockmarket afterwards same thing with breaking up of large enterprises and assetstripping them etc the bank 
needs an investor who has a profitable idea and some percentage of own assets as security and then it 
create large amounts of new money so often not so much of unused profit potential than actually directly wealth 
by the creation of fresh money in the first place that afterwards has to be recouped by a bit 
real estate speculation etc to allow the paying back of the debt with interest that has been loaded onto 
firm that had been bought with freshly created money in the first place in theory if the world gdp 
to rise by eg you would need to expand the amount of money credit in the current system by 
or if you increase the money supply you can increase the of by make the same amount of money 
more by changing hands more often which becomes harder to do the more concentrated wealth is money in rich 
hands circulate as much it just sits there in search of investment assetclasses speculation without actually doing the work 
is supposed to do in creation of new products and services but only jacking up the prices of things 
are already there in reality credit freshly created money was used to a large part for speculation i remember 
actual numbers but over a decade the gdp has risen maybe while the money supply has risen which is 
asset bubbles greatly enhancing boom and bust cycles etc also every now and then debs have to be cancelled 
off you load excessive debts on individuals nor firms nor states when the payment of interest alone is eating 
all the profit we are nearing a natural endpoint if you still pump more credit into the system you 
get wealth redistribution effects without getting a bigger cake the system starts to eat itself up the endpoint of 
cycle leads to a reset in the capitalist system it is long overdue and us is probably the only 
that had several cycles without wars and revolutions on own soil that often accompanies the end of a cycle 
the end of the cycle the rich try to shift their wealth away from banks which will go under 
the unrepayable outstanding debts and into asset classes in which counterparty risk seems less real estate gold cryptocurrencies this 
purely for wealth preservation and need to actually return a profit on investment it just needs to survive the 
of the banks this actually accelerates the implosion but it creates the seeds for the next cycle there is 
most sectors of the economy firms buy back stocks instead of investing in growth because in an economy that 
overladen with debt there is no real growth anymore but only redistribution the state is underinvested the infrastucture is 
so is the education system because even the state can no longer service its debts the ious are bought 
the central bank because private investors lose confidence the only thing still oing on is displacement competition if you 
that the end of the cycle is far enough out to recoup the debt you need to take on 
buy out your competitor then you try that you survive he drops out if you think the end of 
cycle is near you yourself decide to drop out because when the system crashes and you are still in 
you get wiped out there are no winwinsituations anymore only lose and lose less until a large part of 
debt gets reset wiped on a global scale be it by hyperinflation or bankruptcy or debt jubilee ps not 
economist a nurse but that is my understanding a few things i forgot to mention intellectual property rights patents 
are also asset classes expected to survive the collapse of banks resetting the system can also happen by introducing 
new currency often following a war or civil war or revolution when considering what counts as debtoverload of course 
have to look at interest rates and especially the role of compound interest which also is another area where 
could do very interesting radical reforms having money breed money having a class of in a society is not 
but depends on the rules how you setup your money system read about silvio gesell etc as mentioned in 
podcast money is mainly a legal and a social construct the easiest way to do away with a specific 
is having your central bank buy it the central bank can do that whenever you set the rules accordingly 
it the mandate by the government to do so while it still has the trust of the people if 
people of the usa demanded from their government to mandate the fed to buy all student loans and then 
ask for the money back so be it also during the banking crisis there was no need to bailout
