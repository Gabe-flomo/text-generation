to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll and as you know we are not afraid here at mindscape 
getting deep into things and today going to get deep into some of the most profound ideas in philosophy 
about philosophy before talked to philosophers about pretty darn deep ideas about realism about consciousness about physics today going 
talk about truth and truth is one of those things you think maybe a pretty straightforward idea some things 
true some things not anyone marginally acquainted with modern philosophy should know better than that of course things are 
to get really really complicated sc the analogy that i have in my brain is theorem in mathematics kurt 
proved that if you have a sufficiently strong formal system a system where you can prove theorems and so 
using logic and math and deduction then there will always be one of two choices either there are true 
in that system that you can never prove or the system itself is somehow incomplete somehow internally incoherent not 
and this is a surprising result right you might think people did think you could prove everything that was 
in a formal system not true and in fact that lesson generalizes to other ideas that we might have 
truth very very hard to be formal and rigorous and careful about what you mean by the word truth 
so today going to talk to an expert liam kofi bright is a professor of philosophy in the department 
philosophy logic and scientific method at london school of economics if you want to know why the called that 
popper was an influential person back at the london school of economics back in the day so things karl 
was interested in became an entire department philosophy logic and the scientific method going to talk about all of 
things today liam is an expert not only on the formal aspects of what truth is a lot of 
manipulation and proving things and being very very careful and rigorous that goes into this kind of game but 
the down and dirty how do we figure out what is true so not only what is true but 
do we figure it out the game of epistemology so we can go from this crystal clear set of 
and axioms and so forth to really difficult real world questions when you say do you figure out what 
you might say i used a scientific okay well that right sc what not only do we say the 
method is but how does it actually play out in the real world how do we decide who gets 
in journals what is the role of refereeing how do different kinds of scientists bring different perspectives to the 
of what is true and what is false even if we all think that the universe is real and 
there and what is true about it is going to be objective for everyone the ways that we get 
that truth might depend a lot on who we are and what we bring to the table so a 
going on here a wonderful fun conversation this is the last holdover from what i got to do when 
was visiting the uk a little while ago liam was nice enough to let me delay this while other 
got into the queue so i think going to have fun here a little brain teaser go music sc 
kofi bright welcome to the mindscape podcast liam kofi bright hi sean sc i do want to mention for 
listeners that in swinging london at a university so there is construction going on outside lb yeah sorry about 
listeners laughter sc okay the listeners are a flexible bunch by now learned to accept things i thought that 
would talk about the nature of truth and the nature of knowledge and the nature of science and then 
all the extra time we had left over we can think about things to say lb well but once 
settle knowledge truth and science still have about hour left right sc yeah i know have to fill in 
time tell jokes lb okay sc so truth let maybe a good way to get this is to sort 
say look a way that scientists think about what doing they come with a model maybe words like particles 
forces and fields involved and if the model works if it fits the data they will say i have 
some truth the truth is reflected in the relationship of my model to so what do sophisticated grownup philosophers 
about that picture of truth lb sophisticated asking me what the null class thinks laughter so a kind of 
feature of the way philosophers think about truth which is as far as i can tell it diverges from 
everyone else in the world thinks about truth and yet philosophers tend to think of themselves as only explaining 
commonsense view for what worth my experience of talking with scientists has actually been very different the scientists tend 
be very averse to describing the results of their inquiry as truth and partly because i think working in 
background with a more loaded vision of what truth is or would have to be than philosophers tend to 
lb let me explain what i mean so philosophical thinking about truth as done nowadays a sort of classic 
which for instance we teach undergrad students i teach a firstyear course and this would be how i would 
them to it where there was in the early century late century a debate between these kind of stylized 
which we nowadays remember as the correspondence theory of truth the pragmatist theory of truth and the coherentist theory 
truth according to the correspondence theory of truth truth consists in a relationship of correspondence between judgments of some 
be they utterances or written sentences or something like that and the facts where the facts are these metaphysical 
entities out there so for instance if i say one of the standard examples the cat is on the 
then that is true just in case there is this thing a fact out there which is this structured 
of a cat a mat the relationship on that and the cat actually being the thing which is bearing 
relationship to the mat and the correspondence theory of truth sc yeah this seems like the not crazy theory 
far lb i think that would the view which especially philosophers tend to think of as the correspondence theory 
the commonsense theory of truth rather the pragmatist theory of and what going to do is going to go 
them then go back into what are the problems the pragmatist theory of truth has many different iterations not 
canonical formulation the sort of famous slogan is is good by way of and there the idea is something 
true beliefs are those which one expects to work for you in the long run or something like that 
belief has a certain purpose which is helping us orient ourselves and act successfully in the world true beliefs 
those which consistently and systematically help us achieve those purposes they allow belief to fulfill its function successfully sc 
cash value of ideas was the slogan that i was talking about lb yeah there you go right the 
thing the things which in the end how does this belief play out in my life in my actions 
what good is it for me lb what good is it for me in a scientific context that will 
be seen as sort of linked to empiricism where the idea is that true beliefs are those which sort 
bear out experimentally which when i try and test them they end up being wrong and so that would 
the pragmatist theory of truth and the coherentist theory of truth is a bit different from both of those 
the coherentist theory more or less has it that a true belief is a belief which sort of fits 
the maximally coherent theory of the world so imagine you had a sort of fully worked out theory of 
which was able to accommodate all of your observations sort of everything you come across a belief is true 
in case it would fit into that sort of very very complex no doubt will always be hypothetical but 
totality of beliefs so i said this is sort of classic dialectical where these are stylized positions because more 
less all of those have now been abandoned you you very sc oh no i was just going to 
that gone through believing in all those different theories and landed at the coherence theory more than anything else 
now going to tell me that spent my life being wrong in different ways lb yeah and just everything 
laughter sc yeah get used to it lb you sean and you listeners are wrong about everything and me 
guess except for the claim that you were wrong about everything i was right about that okay so the 
course find sort of people who have more sophisticated versions of the initial formulations and so nothing ever dies 
just gets reborn and rebuilt but there are sort of big problems with each of these which make people 
bit wary of assuming any of them go in reverse order so for the coherentist theory typically the worry 
just no way of specifying a unique best theory under that lb the problem is that multiple very consistent 
coherent from what we can tell theories can be formulated which would allow contradictory beliefs in and now i 
no fact of the matter as to which of well i either have to endorse true contradictions or i 
to find some way of deciding between the maximally coherent world views i can formulate and that seem quite 
because the natural way of deciding between a very very consistent fairytale and a very very accurate description of 
world is that one of true and one of them but now being denied to me sc the reason 
it took me so long to even entertain the coherence theory is that it seems obvious to me that 
coherent theories that are completely different and what sort of broke the tie for me was thinking that well 
of the things that your theory needs to be coherent with are your observations of the world right and 
not just internally coherent some external coherence as well lb yeah i should say i probably endorse the coherence 
but more sympathetic than most this is just kind of the standard objection to it that said what i 
people would say to things like what you just said would be that there are always lots and lots 
ways of explaining my immediate experience right so sort of classic examples sc brain in a vat lb brain 
a vat demon deceiving me the matrix whatever sc ultimate brain lb and so the worry is that whatever 
i try and bring in to shore up my coherent theory and introduce constraints on it a sufficiently clever 
weaver can find a way to weave those in and yet still come up with a fundamentally wacky view 
things sc okay lb so kind of the classic problem of course there are things to be said in 
favor of the theory and some people still defend it but most people i think accept it and they 
it on of those grounds for the pragmatist so the worry for the pragmatist theory is roughly that the 
it just said has almost nothing to do with truth laughter sc it all sounds good but looking for 
lb yeah and so you can formulate that in a couple of ways firstly depending on how sympathetic you 
to ideas like this if you did insist on the kind of empiricism interpretation then it seems to many 
that there are candidates for truth or falsity which look like going to have any experimental predictions at all 
classically there a god tell me some properties of that whether an atheist or a theist it seems like 
even an agnostic in some sense committed to there being some truths whether or not we know them or 
they might be and if you interpret the pragmatist maxim in a way which it sort of experimental validation 
what it means to work out for me i just did air quotes you see me doing air quotes 
sc the air quotes are very helpful lb doing air quotes yeah no trust me if you watched me 
would be very good so the experimental validation looks like just going to miss out on a bunch of 
which do seem like candidates for truth and the other worry is it just looks like you can have 
of useful lies so if sc so usefulness is relative to a goal and you could have different goals 
of the same thing as coherence right like this indeterminacy lb right exactly that right so precisely because you 
imagine sort of now i have another parameter to play with and determine if true what i believe how 
world is and what trying to do and now it looks like i can worryingly make things true or 
by varying that third parameter and that just seems irrelevant it like what we were initially trying to do 
truth sc we want truth to be univalent in some way lb right in some kind of sense and 
that puts a lot of people off the pragmatist theory also it was unpopular for a while because in 
way which a lot of people think is fair after the war bertrand russell sort of alleged it was 
with fascism in some kind of way because sc heard that one yeah lb the line being like if 
gets to pick the sc oh okay oh i get it okay lb and so you end up with 
kind of like useful is useful to the volk and then in a very bad place sc halfway back 
yeah then in this old facts world and so that was another thing which i think contributed to its 
and then the correspondence theory which is probably still of those three the most popular of them sc and 
most lb and the most commonsensical yeah more or less viewed by a lot of viewed by a lot 
philosophers it has a kind of dilemma it faces where either it seems a bit trivial it really explain 
like okay i want to know what truth is you tell me that truth is consistent correspondence to reality 
just used a lot of other fancy words sc right lb which sounds kind of like describing sc reality 
lb yeah and so if you just leave it at that or something not much more sophisticated than that 
people worry that not really informative you told me anything about truth at on the flip side and this 
where you feel sorry for correspondence theorists they get that complaint but then whenever they fill in the details 
start to worry that kind of crazy metaphysics sc so both trivial and wrong lb yeah it somehow managed 
like to tell us nothing and also tell us things which are certainly false which is something which i 
only my students could achieve sc no no been accused of that many times lb and so there the 
is if you really start taking seriously the idea that okay not just there are cats and mats and 
they sit on each other but also in the world there is this ordered complex which quite any of 
things individually but which is the unity of them out there in the world and there is this relationship 
can form between your utterance and that thing apparently instantaneously reaching out to this complex and obtaining and failing 
obtain and people are just like on earth are you talking like it becomes worry that no way of 
that thing out which end up invoking mysterious entities sc something mystical unknown lb and so for many people 
while some people do still endorse that philosophers that averse to wacky metaphysics but that is offputting to some 
and so has sufficed to put many people off the correspondence theory of truth sc okay what are we 
with lb well so for one thing i said you can always argue about those forever lb sure not 
giving in not necessarily accepting but clearly if people are rejecting those lb so what say this is kind 
what i initially was getting at when i said it was distinct about philosophers because this is say the 
about to outline is the view most distinctive to contemporary analytic philosophy i never hear it anywhere else and 
think a large part of why scientists and philosophers end up differing so much on truth so the last 
nowadays which i think is more popular i think the most popular but more popular is called deflationism according 
sc not a great sales pitch honestly chuckle lb really really not and as i explained it to you 
to sound really boring but you know what your podcast going to be your problem sc yeah exactly lb 
according to deflationism to say something is true is almost just to repeat it like truth is just a 
of a linguistic device which helps us streamline certain conversations but does nothing more than that so the classic 
of which is x is true if and only if so snow is white is true just in case 
is white and if snow is white then is is true sc so sort of leaning into the objection 
the correspondence theory that just chuckle lb yes indeed right trying to make a virtue of that and saying 
having that schema the truth schema available to us it allows us to do some things which we might 
otherwise be able to do you have to clean it up a bit technically if you just relied on 
schema you end up with a contradiction consider the sentence sentence is if allowed to say sentence is false 
then going to be in trouble because sentence is is true if and only if this sentence is false 
then so you have to clean it up a bit but if you clean it up to avoid contradictions 
the thought is a theory like that technically it allows for some mathematical results you can speed up proofs 
can show that proofs can be made shorter if allowed to involve that kind of thing sc okay lb 
it linguistically allows to do what people call blind descriptions where i can do things like say sean said 
night was well i need to know what you said i can kind of affirm it in a convenient 
so not the only linguistic way of doing that task but one linguistic way of doing that task a 
of kind of tasks truth does for us in terms of expressing agreement or doing some mathematical work but 
more to the truth than that no deep metaphysics here no kind of interesting theory of what this amounts 
kind as if you were having a sort i was just about to say an interesting theory of pronouns 
actually super debated nowadays so not a good example sc yeah no hard to come up with things about 
there are no interesting theories lb right so truth is uniquely uninteresting and so a view which is very 
in analytic philosophy which is has no option uptake anywhere else the relevance of this i think is very 
when people outside of analytic philosophy but i think especially in the sciences here talk of something being true 
truth has i think in ordinary language often has a kind has connotations which are sometimes moral like being 
truthful person is a good thing to be and sometimes a bit mystical the says he is the and 
that seems to sort of imbue it with a degree of religious significance lb and also unrelated to this 
fact this would be something which almost all of the theories i just named would reject but also is 
taken to be related to certainty so if i say something is true kind of really backing it up 
it in a strong way sc yeah lb and all of those things are totally separate for philosophers philosophers 
not just but especially if you have that deflationary view it have any moral significance just a means of 
things it have any connotations of certainty unrelated to that and it have any spiritual or religious significance sc 
if i say something like universe is how do i categorize that within a deflationary theory do i i 
is it possible to make sense of the statement lb well so on a deflationary theory you have whatever 
wanna say about the universe expanding presumably as someone very educated in physical theory like yourself when you say 
thing in the background a theory of what it means for universe to be expanding a sense of what 
of things we should expect to observe and a whole bunch of statements connected with that when you say 
things that licenses me to now make predictions on those grounds to assume that gonna affirm the consequences of 
claim and stuff like that but it being true add anything to like saying universe is or saying true 
universe is add anything new to all of those entailments which are already there sc okay so it makes 
i wanna say subjective but from the point of view of people talking rather than from the eye view 
would like to say that when they discovered the universe is expanding rather than contracting that would have been 
as true if there were no people around talking about right can i still say that in the lb 
a bit complicated in some sense yes because you can just for instance you can say the exact sentence 
just said if no one had discussed it the universe would still have been and that has actually rather 
chuckle lb perhaps that makes certain maybe for instance affirming that there any causal dependencies between our words and 
rate of expansion or anything like that and those are all things we can test and we can vet 
out we can agree with them or disagree with them but saying true do the work of affirming that 
to get that out you need to make additional claims and make your argument for those claims for instance 
there these causal dependencies so i think what a deflationist would like to say is anything you were inclined 
say by means of using the predicate truth you can still say under their theory it just be the 
that the property of being true is ever doing any work for you sc i think finally getting it 
lb and so why deflationary not so to speak deflating what claims you can make about the world what 
is what the role truth plays in those claims sc right so not a theory of objective reality or 
denying realism just that this truth relationship is nothing so special lb yes exactly right and so this view 
the common objections to this view are first i made that sort of glib remark you can clean up 
get rid of the contradictions you can guess sc some work chuckle lb yeah that there are then multiple 
you are left with and you have to decide which are the ones you prefer and that ends up 
controversial and the other thing people object and i think this goes back to michael dummett but now a 
of people that make this objection is that it just misses out a key part of what truth does 
is that we want true beliefs the point of inquiry is to get true beliefs rather than false beliefs 
the deflationists while they of course have things to say in response to the objection they seem to be 
of missing out a key role of truth in our conceptual mental lives if they have that lb so 
rather describes it as if you explain to someone the rules of chess the nature of the pieces and 
and then decline to mention that the point of chess is to check the opponent you really explained what 
is unless you also give the people that detail and so the worry about deflationism is its account of 
role of truth in our lives these communicative roles these technical roles is missing out a key thing and 
that key thing have to invoke something a bit more substantial about what truth is to explain why we 
about getting it in the first place sc is part of the motivation for considering theories like this bit 
tarski established he was i guess he followed gödel gödel showed that there were certain statements that i would 
are true in a formal system but you prove them and tarski basically proved that there were statements that 
like they should be true but you prove them not sure exactly how to say it like statement p 
true if and only if p is true is not a something like that lb so listeners you see 
but also nodding i do air quotes and nods when i am on podcasts sc so do i used 
it gonna get more complaints that i have video on my podcast now but okay yeah lb i just 
creating problems for you really why i came on this so broadly yes there is a relationship between work 
work and deflationism was kind one of the big props or supports for it was that people were able 
take work and say you have work really all you need from a theory of so what tarski did 
or less was find a way the first rigorous and consistent way of retaining a lot of that is 
if and only if formula without running into those contradictions the way he did it was by saying you 
is a kind of hierarchy of languages where in the base level no truth predicate at all then a 
above that you can speak about formulas in the level below sc below it as being true lb being 
and then you can have another level of truth predicate where you could also affirm those and so on 
so on sc and you just live with the infinity of levels lb you live with an infinite hierarchy 
sc okay chuckle lb so one way of trying to get a consistent theory out of this there are 
ways of doing this there are also people who are trying to avoid the hierarchy so now a a 
technical field of mathematical logic which is looking at how to do this sc yeah pretty fiercely technical if 
look at these papers right lb yes it quickly sc gibberish really laughter lb gibberish how very dare you 
how dare you and also a thriving theory of trying to give axiomatic theories where you have axioms governing 
truth predicate and see how they behave so a thriving technical field which is related but not as closely 
as you might think to those philosophical theories i just mentioned like tarski for instance in his work at 
times suggested he was doing something kind of like a deflationary theory and also something like a correspondence theory 
not really clear that he sc what the correspondence is chuckle lb yeah he certainly seem to know or 
that much which exactly these was and i have just guaranteed you a bunch of angry emails from scholars 
yeah oh good i will forward them to you no worries laughter lb no okay well darn sc but 
good now you convinced me that i have little idea of what truth is but also given the history 
hundred years from now no gonna accept any of these theories and have a laughter sc we settled yet 
right lb yes it does look sc right not equilibrated lb yes well as far as i can tell 
only ever knocks things out of equilibrium laughter lb but yes right now say if i was to make 
prediction about where this is gonna go is there will eventually have to be some kind of unification of 
advanced technical work with the more traditional theories of what truth amounts to there are some logicians who are 
in a sort of building on initial suggestions to be serious he was a very good scholar obviously sc 
lb and who are trying to claim that in some sense you can see this technical work as a 
of deflationism but all i need to do is lay down sparse or fairly minimal rules sc some rules 
lb so starting to get that there are other people going in other directions too but i predict that 
time goes by get more of a sense of how the technical logical mathematical more scientific work relates to 
traditional high level philosophical work and that will give us a better understanding of what truth is and what 
of role it plays for us sc okay good i wanna go back to moving this to connect with 
once again but i think still some more philosophy that we need to get out of the way laughter 
when we talk about true statements or when we talk about the statements different kinds of truth things that 
can imagine proving logically things that you have to go out and experimentally verify and i know let me 
to say this in my words and then you can fix it chuckle lb happy to sc the notions 
the reasons why things are true some things are true in virtue of themselves or the definitions of their 
and we call those analytic there are things that are virtue of true because how the world is but 
might have been otherwise and we call the synthetic also how we know that things are true there are 
we know just from reason alone a priori and things that we know by going and doing experiments a 
so these are two very similar sounding things but a little bit different did i get it mostly right 
yeah a reasonable summary of the traditional distinctions drawing yeah sc yeah and so to me and i guess 
david hume it sounds like this very close connection between a priori truths ones that are true that you 
show just by logic and analytic truths ones that are true just by virtue of their definitions whereas another 
between a posteriori synthetic things that you go out how did i define synthetic i forget but synthetic sounds 
a posteriori analytic sounds like a priori lb yeah sc do people basically buy that i know that immanuel 
tried to argue there was wiggle room there lb yes so kant famously argued that a category of things 
are synthetic making substantial claims not just given in their definitions but really making claims on the world but 
are nonetheless a priori which are things you know by means of reason reason alone and as far as 
can tell and this is another one where the eventually just gonna have to say just deal with like 
me fired safe sc right lb and so subject to the correction from scholars kant seems to have been 
of thinking about then relatively relatively recent newtonian science and he was very confident like achieved knowledge we know 
about which is that it works on broader newtonian lines and sort of the dominant epistemology coming from many 
primarily loch and the european continent was that this is kind of experiential knowledge we know this because done 
right kind of experiments gained the right kind of experiences and it validates our claims and we finally worked 
how to do that lb and kant saw that that quite work and the reason it quite work he 
and i think many people agree with him is that some of the claims that seem to be necessary 
newtonian physics seem to admit of those kind of tests for instance it seems to people at the time 
we would now disagree with this but it seemed to people at the time that that space has something 
euclidean structure was something we presupposed when did our experiments we test that rather when we were testing claims 
the distance between things or the speed at which things moved we were then presupposing it lb and so 
worried that this seems therefore like this worrying fact that a bunch of really foundational claims to this science 
he really wanted to validate as achieving knowledge of the world were just not supported by the means that 
had to support things and so kant built sort of a philosophical apparatus to explain how there could be 
claims actually which were substantial for instance that space has euclidean structure while at the same time not requiring 
validation we could know that just by reflection and so that was for kant that was equal to synthetic 
priori sc okay and that sounds wrong especially because not even exactly true that space has a euclidean structure 
so that might have been a little premature on part lb yes right so a little bit complicated what 
relationship is between what kant said and what eventually became refuted it did laughter sc not a famously clear 
lb not quite no and in particular the issue is not like what happened was we stopped having apparently 
priori roles for some kinds of geometric structure in space we may not use the particular one which kant 
we had to use but still something playing a some people might argue something playing a somewhat similar role 
to be frank have no real opinion about this sc yeah those people are wrong just so we know 
lb yeah so but some people claim that at a sufficiently high level of abstraction you could maintain claim 
was just too specific in saying this is particular structure space has to have but he wrong that space 
to that we need to a priori attribute to space some kind of structure in order to do our 
sc but you see this is where getting back into truth right open to the idea that there are 
for us making sense of the world but different than saying those preconditions are true you can then say 
have made some sense of the world therefore empirically i have verified that this particular presupposition lb well i 
this does this might be a point where which of those theories of truth we endorse makes a difference 
how you wanna understand going on so more or less for the deflationist to say that true that space 
suchandsuch a structure is more or less just to repeat that space has suchandsuch a structure so once told 
your theory not adding anything to it by telling me true and to that extent kind of not he 
just i say he as in i am the deflationist i would just disagree with the claim that to 
that space has a structure is different from saying true that space has a structure lb on the other 
to a correspondence theorist maybe there might be more involved maybe when you say that space has this structure 
extra involved in saying that corresponds to some external maybe some claims are different and they need to have 
correspondence theory this would be a version of what people call truth pluralism where they have kind of more 
the correspondence relation because different claims correspond to the world in different kinds of ways and so i need 
tell you not just that space has a structure but what kind of correspondence relationship you need to be 
for in order to bear this kind of claim out and that would make it such that there is 
a little bit of extra work to be done at least in explaining exactly what you mean when you 
space has this structure and so this might be a point where like which of those theories of truth 
tempting to you at least makes a difference to what kind of things you think you need to do 
fully explain what you mean when you make claims about the structure of space sc okay fair but it 
sound like at least provisionally okay in making my naive statements about are mathematical and logical truths and there 
scientific truths and lb so no i just get to that yet laughter sc we have all the time 
lb alas in the century this is kind of associated with quine eventually this division between analytic and synthetic 
truths which are true in virtue of their meaning versus truths which are true in virtue of something about 
the world is independent of language came under quite stern criticism within philosophy and more or less the criticism 
that like so to speak a little bit arbitrary how you categorize things on one side of this versus 
other sc okay chuckle lb so the thought being not quite sure what the thought is always thought the 
were just silly laughter sc we can categorize whole regions of philosophical debate as silly okay lb oh on 
i do that all the time chuckle lb but i guess just the thought being that this notion of 
analytic truth something true in the virtue of meaning when you try and cache it out kind of similar 
the complaints about the correspondence theory when you try and cache it out what you will find is it 
on notions which are themselves quite mysterious and we have a theory of it that you have to sort 
invoke notions of synonymy or necessary equivalence which themselves well theorized and once you try and really think about 
or really make sense of it eventually what left with is something more like there are some claims which 
more to defend than in terms of really have to do a lot of work to make me give 
on the claim that all bachelors are unmarried lb like something which really really really requires a pretty drastic 
in my worldview but you could do it like you just so to speak i yet found the circumstance 
it would be convenient for me to give up that claim but you could do it other claims are 
to being revisable in light of my experiences and so what a lot of philosophers came to think was 
notion of analytic versus synthetic was just a bad way of making theoretical sense of the difference between how 
beliefs are for us and really all there is is this entrenchment and a sort of much more that 
in sc so quine is trying to give us a spectrum rather than just the two options lb yeah 
or less things we more or less central to our belief structure sc but are you advocating this or 
that there are people who advocate it it does not sound very convincing to me i think that all 
are unmarried men chuckle lb i am mentioning it rather than advocating it sc yeah okay lb i tend 
think one of those things where it relies on a crucial point in this argument is that there are 
somewhat mysterious notions we just make sense of quine the person who most influentially launched this attack was making 
in the just before there were a lot of developments where we developed tools where i think we can 
make sense of those notions and so i think it was sensible in light of the state of theoretical 
at the time but i think it really bears out and so it sort of entered philosophical lore that 
was refuted but i think it was sort of that decision warrants reexamination in light of later developments sc 
i have this vague feeling from a completely unqualified perspective that if we fix some things up in our 
of language and logic and things like that there would be a clearer distinction and maybe it has to 
with possible worlds and if something is true in every possible world or something like that different than being 
in some possible worlds but not others lb well some of the technical machinery which philosophers use to analyze 
bunch of concepts will be in terms of good modal which is the logic of possibility and necessity well 
philosophers tend to think about that is they will have possible worlds which depending on how you describe them 
either concrete real existent worlds just not ones we can physically sc yeah the one scientists care about but 
there are philosophers who buy that yeah chuckle lb or more sensibly just complete descriptions of the world which 
or may not be actual which you may not endorse which may not be true but you can give 
descriptions of the world sc i sorry i really need before i forget mention that max tegmark a previous 
guest really does believe in all the other possible worlds also a mathy version of david lewis yeah lb 
of the genuine and i mean this genuine joys of being in academia is whenever i think just too 
and no one could believe it there are always chuckle sc always very respectable lb ten times smarter than 
who have passionate defenses of that and just left in awe of what the human mind can do but 
right so you could view possibilities as just a stats thing or as descriptions of how the world might 
and then the apparatus of modal logic is a way of reasoning about like if we think of ourselves 
this space of possibilities what follows necessary from here only possible from etcetera and some of that machinery can 
brought in to try and make sense of the notions required to make sense of analyticity i wanna give 
the impression that this is settled but i happen to think you can do it but there are reasonably 
people who think you can do it but those are exactly the developments i have in mind and that 
kind of a nice illustration really of if you follow the story lb we begin already in the early 
europe appearance of a interaction between philosophy and scientific reflection where you have philosophers and scientists trying to think 
like can we be confident in what seems like a very well grounded from that we get new technical 
machinery designed to try and help us make sense of those notions which philosophers then used to problematise some 
the initial notions of theory that it was built on but then that itself spurs new technical developments and 
are getting better at being able to validate this and a really nice virtuous circle of critique and response 
critique in a way which is developing us new tools and allowing us to make sense of things which 
hard to make sense of before sc good and i think this leads us right into the scientific practice 
i was hoping to get to the system you just described is what science would ideally like to be 
with a little bit of data thrown in right we come up with theories we compare them with data 
still unfortunately teach kids at least in the us that something called the scientific method that francis bacon laid 
and all scientists follow and a little baby hypothesis grows up to be a theory and then finally graduates 
being a law none of that is actually true in scientific practice but there is some sort of the 
and take between hypothesizing and collecting data is certainly there what is your read on a better way that 
might teach high school students how science is done than the baconian scientific method lb yeah right i think 
is a really fascinating topic and actually something i think about professionally where exactly as you say the same 
the uk people are taught this kind of stylized vision of scientific method and it really just correspond to 
i think science in practice works and even how it should work it be good if we tried to 
science work like that sc and the irony is very thick right laughter sc a theory that has no 
to experiments chuckle okay lb so i right now i think the best bet i could have for how 
reform scientific not right scientific education would be to base it actually on some ideas from a different philosopher 
would be dewey from the american pragmatist tradition sc pragmatist yeah lb where dewey was this famous educational theorist 
actually one of the places where he had most influence and he had sort of learn by doing was 
philosophy and he really actually kind of modeled his whole theory of education on what he took to be 
more realistic model of how scientific inquiries is done and the idea would be you sort of give people 
materials with which to solve those problems and space to reflect on what doing as doing it and so 
give people some materials and tell them can i make this chemical do that to turn this whatever it 
be sc yeah lb they then get some space to play around with the materials they got and then 
gotta tell you what did you do and why sc right lb in the process of doing this gonna 
a bunch of facts about scientific inquiry because in some sense science is that kind of activity but scaled 
and in much more communication with other people and so for instance a classic example something which tend to 
much in stylized descriptions of the scientific method but actually super important and is the subject of much debate 
around the replication crisis at some point when testing a claim you have to stop testing it stop seeking 
evidence and decide have enough evidence to write this how do you do that what are the rules which 
how you do that that feature at all in the normal picture of the stylized picture of scientific method 
people talk as if at one point nature rings a bell and sc binary you got it or you 
yeah lb right exactly if you set children that task they would have to discover that problem because you 
to at some point work out like done enough to be confident this is the way and in so 
they could reflect on kind of features of the scenario made me think that now was the time to 
that what would have made me think we need to do more what made me think we need to 
and so by engaging in scientific research learn key features of how the practice is done how these decisions 
be made in a way which fit the stylistic method but arbitrary either are responding to features of your 
situation and doing something which is kinda fun chuckle chuckle sc way more fun than learning all the elements 
whatever lb yeah and so this is the kind of thing which be really interested in there being much 
experimentation around sc yeah but i think the part that is valuable or important to me that maybe you 
there is this idea that we are comparing different possible worlds we have hypotheses just going back to the 
discussion like a big part of the scientific method is saying know which world we live in different theories 
might describe the world all theories that describe some world which one do we live in so gonna collect 
data and maybe not binary but at least as good bayesians we will increase our credence in one of 
hypotheses and decrease in the lb well actually i would hope that a good process of doing education would 
people do that because one of the things one wishes to learn is what kind of experiments are worth 
and eventually you need to learn that some experiments differentiate between hypotheses because in either of these possible worlds 
would expect the same given this test and so in learning about like how do i do an experiment 
decides or at least gives me evidence relevant to deciding between these having to think about it and by 
process of doing that you have to hold in your mind what would be true if this hypothesis and 
would be true if that listeners should be aware now doing very helpful hand gestures for each hypothesis so 
would be true in each of those hypotheses do the working out what the consequences would be and how 
for the materials you have available and that is as a baby version of something like hypothetical or deductive 
which is if not the be all and end of all science is at least part of it and 
is also a type of reasoning which necessitates you thinking about different possibilities lb and so again allowing throwing 
into scenarios as long as they have the time to communicate and reflect with each other really i think 
teaches in practice a lot of these things as long as you guide them to point out features of 
what just and so yes i certainly agree that a core feature of any scientific reasoning is in some 
sense counterintuitive but actually important that we reason about not actual science requires that you reason about possibilities which 
which accurate descriptions of the world and kind of interesting in many ways i to come back to something 
you first said a core reason why when you say have my model that almost all models in fact 
false claims sc right lb right so that quite be right and so there are al these times in 
where and i would think people would learn really by doing this is in some sense science just consist 
saying true things a bunch of nontrue stuff you have to deal with but that invalidate it either sc 
not at all lb and so one of the sc it validates it right chuckle lb exactly how in 
we gain reliable knowledge sc yeah lb and so one of the advantages which philosophers like heather douglas or 
kitcher often claim for citizens or young people being able to do this kind of more engaged deweyan education 
that a lot of attempts to undermine public trust in science involve pointing to these features which people aware 
a typical feature of scientific practice but which is just part of how we do things and pointing out 
did you know that these models involve a bunch of false assumptions then how can you really trust what 
climate scientists are if you knew how science works like the models involve false assumptions how we do right 
yeah lb and so by giving people practice and seeing for themselves that like i made some simplified assumptions 
a problem what allowed me to get the it would immunize them in some sense to certain kinds of 
skeptical attacks sc right right but the idea i really maybe just repeating myself but the idea that we 
be wrong that we are not simply purely reasoning our way to how the world works is very crucial 
me in science i remember hearing a talk by an unnamed evolutionary psychologist who was founding an institute or 
like that and they made it very clear purpose of our institute is to show that blah blah blah 
lb right sc and i wanted to raise my hand as like not really very sciencey there how about 
find out whether or not it is a slightly a slight but important distinction there lb well an employee 
the london school of economics this department was founded by karl popper so you chuckle lb legally obliged to 
with what you just said but there are some philosophers heretics who might think at least a bit more 
now i mean jokes aside i honestly am actually pretty sympathetic to a broadly falsificationist view of what up 
in science it always sit so easily with the bayesianism set that aside for now sc sorry much more 
very falsifiable i think i got in trouble by writing a paper the title was and to point out 
this was popper put his finger on some things that were really really important but not the final solution 
the demarcation and i think that bayesianism helps get us closer to a more nuanced view lb right okay 
that case i think probably sympathetic i think something to be said for the falsificationist picture but i agree 
the be all and end all sc either way you have this idea that you could be wrong lb 
but what i was gonna mention is a vision of scientific practice which is in some sense dependent from 
although quite sure kuhn would probably not want to be associated with some of the people you perhaps have 
mind wherein the way science works is by setting up paradigms those paradigms involve not unquestionable but at least 
unquestioned assumptions and legitimate to go forward like way i do science is in light of those assumptions now 
draw out the implications and test for other things you can make sense of in light of those but 
necessarily test in the lakatos building right now and so lakatos is famous for saying theories have a protected 
a hard core in the center and eventually that can be penetrated but of reasonable procedure to begin with 
which you are less willing to give lb in some sense that actually relates to the quinian point we 
saying earlier where many who do think a sort of reasonable vision of how rational inquiry goes is you 
some beliefs which are much more central which much less willing to give up and okay to do things 
first trying to swap out the less core beliefs and seeing how you can do things and of course 
can imagine the sort of quasibayesian justification for that kind of procedure sc well this is why one of 
issues with falsifiability as a solution to the demarcation problem is plenty of examples where i have a theory 
well established an experimental result comes along that is in contradiction to that theory and everyone in their right 
says worry that result will go laughter lb i still think light draws overlapping conversation sc faster than light 
that would be an example yes right yeah scientists they have their preconditions they have their what we call 
principles this is what we like to call them and you wanna give them up but eventually you end 
doing it if you get enough evidence against it and to me that kind of fits in with the 
theory a little bit sorry with the coherence theory i wanted to say a little bit lb can you 
more about how sc to be coherent is to be coherent amongst a bunch of beliefs and some of 
will be more switch outable than others right lb right sc some of them will be more foundational some 
your beliefs lb so the thing about both the pragmatist and the coherence theories of truth is they clearly 
up on aspects of our mental lives which are important we do in fact have goals and beliefs do 
us fulfill those goals and some reason to prefer a belief if it helps you fulfill your goal our 
can be more or less coherent at least in the sense of being selfconsistent or not being selfconsistent and 
may prefer to be selfconsistent i think there are true contradictions i know if chuckle one sc another podcast 
lb one may prefer to be selfconsistent and in that case and so for that reason the coherence theory 
be picking up on something because more or less just saying that particular virtue of your belief system being 
like the one which makes the difference with truth so what noncoherence theorists are gonna say is like have 
way of recovering within our theory the importance of lb so for instance the correspondence theorist will tend to 
a metaphysical theory about what the facts are and just say like turns out that the facts be such 
inconsistent of each other and so if your theory is incoherent in the sense of being inconsistent we know 
because we know that the facts sc fair everyone wants to be coherent just whether or not the yeah 
and so right and so what find is that theories of and this is i think one of the 
why theory of truth tends something which attracts maybe people to deflationism is it tends to be the case 
you can recover whatever nice things you wanna say about one theory of truth within the other theory of 
and without just being a justification for deflationism it can prompt the thought that it really matter what you 
up saying about truth you always find a way of saying the nice things you want to be able 
say anyway and so truth really doing much there you just have some additional principles able to bring in 
get you the goods you want sc is it sort of a dirty little secret of philosophy that so 
of it is driven by things you want to be the case chuckle and then finding ways to make 
things you wanna be the case be the case or maybe a virtue i even know but certainly you 
think of moral philosophy that often ends up being lb well quine sc but maybe even epistemology true lb 
sure either dirty little or a secret laughter sc okay lb so for that reason sc but other than 
sc i think dirty lb certainly the case so is it a secret people say mean things to me 
the internet all the time which suggest that they think philosophy is so plenty of people probably know about 
is it little or dirty is a bit more complicated because yes true that philosophy as a field precisely 
relatively unconstrained by direct empirical data or relatively unconstrained by rigors of proof mean that if you come in 
like really committed to keeping this you can find a way of constructing a worldview which retains that principle 
which has other desirable features and some philosophers more or less just and the game sc what doing right 
the game is you come in with the things really committed sc here are my commitments lb and you 
to the world will no doubt still present you with puzzles so i just mentioned i believe there are 
contradictions suppose you what do you wanna say about sentences like this very sentence is false sc so you 
believe there are true contradictions lb yes sc that was lb i do so i more or less think 
we want to say about very sentence is is that both true and false and so if you and 
going to defend it right now but if you think that you have to tell me something because it 
out there are sort of pretty minimal and apparently plausible things you might say about truth which will get 
sentence is both true and and so sc roughly the alternative must be that meaningless or unsayable out of 
somehow lb you can out of bounds somehow you can have it not wellformed because applying a truth predicate 
itself in a wrong kind of way or you can have it such that it gets no value like 
just fails to be evaluated but in any case building a worldview which gets you either out of bounds 
meaningless or not wellformed or whatever that requires work and so in other words not a trivial game even 
you do come in with your strong commitments like to build a theory which does that and in the 
of building those theories you often are forced to do things which are themselves intellectually quite valuable and so 
people will say that this activity of elaborating upon and defending core commitments is actually in the end intellectually 
valuable because if you take that game seriously find really difficult and what you have to do to play 
well is just a real driver of innovation sc okay some of my best friends are philosophers i want 
no perfectly happy with being selfloathing sc there we go that works lb yeah sc speaking of selfloathing not 
scientists off the hook you already mentioned the replication crisis i want to get a little bit down and 
into the difference between the pristine way in which scientists naively think of their own pastime and the ugly 
of how it gets done because the ugly truth always becomes a little bit prettier when you really face 
to it right lb i thought we were being selfloathing gone two sc not selfloathing at all gotta love 
laughter not is my attitude certainly not the youtube commenters i know that lb i love you sean sc 
so the replication crisis i think most people have heard of it but why we say what it is 
sure so in social psychology especially but not just in social psychology in relatively recent years been found that 
bunch of results which people took to be secure which were featuring in textbooks and which public interventions were 
based on in fact replicate which is to say when we try and retest the experiments which initially validated 
phenomena were real we find either that we get the effect at all or much reduced in its strand 
full degree of influence than we initially thought so the sense just replication failure lb what made it a 
were in a sort of illdefined sense this happened so many times to so many results that people felt 
there was a systematic problem here i raise that explicitly because often a little bit underwhelmed by the arguments 
that second part like what is the rate at which we should expect true ideas in science i think 
are blase about assuming a crisis but nonetheless in the course the fact that this prompted a kind panic 
is too strong but this prompted quite a strong reaction from the scientific community and the social sciences and 
especially and nowadays as well actually in philosophy of science led to a bunch of problems being uncovered with 
way science was done or at least things which people were pretty clear could be improved upon and so 
a quite broad reform movement sweeping through the social sciences which is trying to address the problems thus identified 
and presumably part of it part of the worry that it was really serious was that like you say 
just random but reflects systematic biases in the field when you get an exciting lb yeah sc where you 
it right when you just get a null result no one is going to care lb yes one of 
fascinating things about the replication crisis is that a lot of the things we are now responding to it 
light of all of these problems people were aware of them in some sense for a long time and 
the kind the classic one is the file drawer problem right where if i get a positive result suggesting 
is an effect exciting especially with a new thing i can go and publish that in a high prestige 
which lots of people will read and become aware of if i fail to find anything and even if 
just replicate that not exciting much harder to get published and often that information will only be available to 
particular scientist who did the thought experiment and so a massive bias in what kind of information is transmitted 
the community at large now that has certainly been a thing which people have discussed a lot in light 
the replication crisis but no way that people only became aware of this possibility inside of sc right lb 
a thing people have worried about for a long time and so one of the things the replication crisis 
really done like the replication failures were dramatic and drew attention to problems but what actually now doing in 
of that is really cleaning up house in ways we probably should have done a long time ago and 
right now of course a lot of anger in some ways as people are sort of arguing with each 
about what should be done some people are feeling defensive because they feel like their work is under attack 
in the long run actually very optimistic that what this is like only doing what we should have been 
for a long time and hopefully it will lead to a much stronger much improved scientific process in the 
sc but once you do admit that even scientists have biases then maybe they have other biases as well 
this becomes a problem of much wider scope and we can start people take it seriously right it sounds 
questioning their integrity although really not just doing epistemology in some sense lb yeah i mean so there are 
sorts of other biases besides just the bias towards publishable or fancy and more exciting results and other ones 
of course get much attention are sort like demographic like gender biases for instance and who can get published 
where sc we have those in physics but lb yeah sc that you have those in other fields lb 
like the gender utopia which is physics certainly like one source of bias which has really negatively affected a 
of lives if being serious and so other kind of biases you might see are for instance towards not 
things which the scientific community will find exciting in terms of publishing in fancy journals but also and this 
very worrying in light of what we do as science there might be biases towards the kind of thing 
the media will pick up on on which policy people will pick up on and so that you get 
cases of what looks like outright fraud and that outright fraud being driven basically by the sense that a 
to clout with the media and with policymakers lb and so yeah all of these things do influence how 
behave they can have the social biases which are very common they need to get published in order to 
their career in fact most of my research is about the effects those career incentives have on working scientists 
also like anyone else they want to change the world in ways they view to be desirable and so 
desire to influence policymakers or people who are going to make a difference to the world that can really 
their behavior and yes some of these seem like they admit of relatively simple fixes not exactly clear how 
check the file drawer problem but there are both technical statistical actually bayesian sc we can do the statistics 
what called lb we can do the statistics better and you can also reform how journals publish or what 
of things that give an uptake in such a way that we can mitigate at least the effects of 
file drawer problem but do you have a solution for gender bias and do you have a solution for 
subtle influences of wanting to be influential in the world these sort of there are a bunch of things 
which are going to be much harder to really fully correct for but which all which is part of 
phenomena we know as the replication crisis i think that what we have to do so to speak is 
our best to fix these things but also in some sense just quite right for people to decrease their 
in this institution insofar as their trust was previously based on a image of scientific researchers or science as 
social process which made it immune from those things not immune to those things and so a well calibrated 
trusts it to the degree that they have taken into account the real presence of these biases sc sadly 
are no well calibrated agents right people either think infallible or completely untrustworthy right the problem lb not so 
about that but the reason not so pessimistic is just because i think i encounter people quite frequently who 
of course not perfectly well calibrated but much better calibrated than just like unthinking deference versus total skepticism do 
scientists rule the internet too style reasoning and those are people who are familiar with it as a practice 
find that both philosophers of science and also working scientists tend to have this kind of attitude except about 
own work right chuckle lb and then just are you selfloathing or wildly overconfident and those are the only 
options and so then relating then to that previous book on education this is kind of what i meant 
immunizing people i do think that it seems that familiarity with the practice being engaged with science tends to 
give you a sense of there really is something unusually reliable about this as a way of reasoning not 
any other way of reasoning about the world there really is something special about it but at the same 
not magic either sc no lb and only as good as lots of smart people repeatedly failing but maybe 
a bit better could be and about right and so i hope that actually by sort of in some 
democratizing science by bringing more people in by giving more people an experience of the practice of scientific research 
more calibrated to how actually done rather than the sort of quasiauthoritarian retrospect are some laws discovered and you 
to believe these laws and the test consists of you repeating these laws to rather than that we have 
more proof as a sense of like what this enterprise actually involves that would actually really help that would 
those calibrated systems so i think there are some people who have it now and optimistic that a reasonably 
method of creating more people who are calibrated in that kind of way sc i would like to be 
also but before i become optimistic i do want to emphasize even more ways to be pessimistic i think 
when it comes to biases like gender biases and racial biases that exist in science just as much as 
society sure but then these softer biases which probably also exist in society where people who have idiosyncratic ideas 
find that they just get paid attention to or they get jobs or they get grants and not like 
is banning them but just choosing not to pay attention to them and their ideas can wither on the 
or not get paid attention for that reason and of course they will say the system is biased against 
maybe right or maybe their idea just very good right and do we have any objective way of telling 
things lb no i think that one of the things the well calibrated agent with regards to their trust 
science just has to learn is and this is a thing which i do think which popper even if 
have put it exactly as i would put it was he really had the fundamentals of this idea in 
science is so to speak a quasievolutionary process there are lots of people throwing up lots of ideas lots 
the time most of those ideas survive a lot of them for good reason occasionally miss one which we 
have paid more attention to but so to speak we got anything better than just having lots of people 
their best and throwing themselves at a problem come up with the ideas they come up with lb and 
long as there are incentives to pay some attention to new ideas which there usually are in science we 
talk about that in a second we can reasonably hope that eventually we will catch good valuable new ideas 
we will actually have something we will eventually be able to build on them and i think those incentives 
take new ideas seriously do exist in science because if a new idea really does work out then i 
use it to bolster my ideas sc yeah lb the thought being that if i have access to some 
experimental technique which actually works some new mathematical theory which allows me to make inferences i otherwise have made 
whatever then suddenly i can do a thing to bolster support for my ideas at least i have some 
to be trying to search in the field and looking out for things which other people have missed which 
give me an advantage in the race to get my ideas taken seriously and so the incentive structure of 
does provide at least some push towards taking those ideas seriously not pollyannish actually a lot of my work 
about how i think we can try and do this better but these are features of the present system 
they just need to be built upon and strengthened rather than not starting from nothing here sc you did 
the radicalsounding idea of getting rid of prepublication peer review is that right lb yes i did funny i 
someone who spends too much of my life on twitter and always getting into political arguments about the hot 
issues of the day on twittercom and yet nothing that i have said has drawn me as much sc 
was going to say yeah lb as the claim we should get rid of prepublication peer review this was 
coauthored work with my friend and colleague remco heesen and the pair of us have this paper which was 
of in some ways a summary of the last few years of both of our research sort realized that 
were sort of both coming to a similar conclusion so we put our heads together and coauthored this piece 
what we argue in there is that most of the things which prepublication peer review is meant to do 
us either no evidence that it does it or some evidence that it fails to do it and sc 
just to be clear the words are important here so tell the audience what how defining the thing that 
want to get rid of lb so right now how do many fields not in all fields actually already 
in some fields but in many fields the way new ideas get taken up is not privately but in 
small groups a scientist or a group of scientists produce a manuscript they maybe share it with some of 
friends get feedback and then eventually they will submit it to a journal the journal will have an editorial 
and some editors that is to say and reviewers and the editor will send it to reviewers the reviewers 
decide whether or not they think a good paper in light of the advice the editor will publish or 
publish lb so up to that point the people who decided whether or not this idea is worthy of 
attention from the scientific community are whatever the immediate peer group the editor and whatever the reviewers think this 
decides what claims are put out there to try and garner more attention or not our point about this 
is very laborintensive it takes a lot of time for lot of scientists actually also and this is not 
relevant to our point but a fairly extortionate business the scientific publication houses are like the most profitmaking sc 
know a bit crazy lb yeah because they just get a bunch of free labor from phds yeah so 
small group of people have put in a lot of effort to decide whether or not an idea is 
sharing it then gets out there and gets whatever uptake it gets once in a journal more or less 
question is all of that labor in deciding whether or not something is worth putting out to the broader 
and having them assess it what does that achieve is there is there any firm evidence that doing something 
for us rather than just directly putting it out in some kind of archive which is actually increasingly the 
in physics and maths that is how are things done actually a lot of economics is kind of moving 
way some fields are going this way but just putting it up on some kind of publicly accessible space 
going directly to the stage where the community are able to assess it as a whole sc philosophers also 
have this idea of a working paper where a draft that for years will be on their website and 
comment on it before they submit it to a journal lb yeah in some sense it kind we want 
make all of science work operate more like sc more like philosophy yeah lb yeah i often think that 
world would be better if it was more like how i think it should be how familiar and comfortable 
it so yes what people claim in defense of peer review are a number of things and sort of 
paper really consists in us going through the various rationales that have been offered for it and trying to 
the empirical evidence for it now the called is prepublication peer review a good idea and partly to reflect 
fact that right now we think the evidence always as strong as like it to be before making a 
assessment so we are clear that to some extent what we want to do here is just prompt people 
tradition has given us this expensive very large bureaucracy we all spend a lot of our time on sc 
lb just inherit it and pass it on do we want to have it and it doing for us 
and not even necessarily questioning peer review but the idea of not letting anyone read the paper until it 
been peer reviewed lb exactly questioning prepublication peer review in some sense we say this in the paper a 
in which we want more peer review we want more people to be able to access and evaluate the 
and for the opinions of the scientific community about the merits of a paper to reflect the judgments of 
scientists so in some way what we want so we kinda link it to the open science movement a 
in which we want open peer review in fact open peer review though is a word for a different 
of thing but related to what proposing whereas the claims that for instance peer review helps us sort the 
ideas from the bad ideas or sort false claims from true claims really not much evidence that peer review 
achieving that and in some sense because science is hard and two people sc i think that hard lb 
sc no okay actually very hard yeah just kidding lb two or three people sc just kidding audience lb 
sean carroll is actually winking at me now he tells me not kidding he means it he just thinks 
sc irony irony is everywhere here you never know whether serious or not lb in some sense the judgements 
a couple of people who just happened to have got it first not necessarily gonna be great at deciding 
or not this really is an idea which was sc we all have examples of bad papers that have 
through peer review and good papers that have been stopped lb yeah and a kind you want to lean 
much on this kind of flashy but onetime experiment but illustrative this kind of famous experiment where people anonymized 
lightly changed nonessential identifying details of classic papers incredibly highly cited resubmitted them for review and i think it 
like half were rejected on grounds of serious technical flaws sc right lb sc oh in fact another study 
think that most highlycited papers were rejected in one part in the real world because the super highlycited papers 
gonna be a bit more daring a bit way easier as a practicing physicist i can promise and i 
say parenthetically i love refereeing in peer review i appreciate the effort that goes into making papers better both 
referees and from editors lb i do not and i want future editors assessing my work to know i 
you i value what you sc there you go having said that if you write a paper that is 
but true way easier to get it published than if you write a paper that is interesting and daring 
right no and that is one of the things we address in the paper a real reason to think 
a kind of small c conservative bias in peer review precisely because and this is so to speak inevitable 
we assess a new idea we are assessing in light of what we already know what we already believe 
but the problem is is preventing other people from being able to engage in that practice unless a relatively 
number of people decide it meets their standards and i think that on net this is just a disadvantageous 
lb as i said we are clear and i wish to be clear in this podcast that when being 
being cheeky my real opinion is there are plenty of times in a paper where we say what needs 
happen here is rather than assessing things according to intuition about what this is doing there needs to be 
sociological work on actually happening and very often people do that they just have a sense that surely this 
the sort of thing which peer review must do it must be selecting for high quality work right otherwise 
would we do and no look at the evidence not clear it is sc yeah look at the evidence 
like the teaching of the scientific method i mean there is this idea that we can just think our 
into the truth but sometimes you have to look at whether it worked lb right no exactly and peer 
is something which i think was intuitive to many people that it surely hurt and yet and sc it 
filter out a lot of truly bad stuff right lb yeah sc that is a true fact the edge 
that we could improve a little bit lb yeah even that is kind of complicated because the importance of 
out truly bad stuff because people put truly bad stuff on the internet anyway so i sc yeah heard 
sc the internet lb if you go to the wrong bit of the internet there are people with false 
just putting them out there sc they allow that lb yeah who knows the government ought to do something 
the please in the meantime the reason kind of important scare quotes to filter things out is the sense 
being put in a journal is in some sense a stamp of approval a validation of that opinion in 
world without journals what does it matter that one more person puts up a wacky enough very well validated 
on the internet what we say the one thing be this is one of the points where we acknowledge 
problems for our work is is we we think if you really think about journals this is that thinking 
the hypothesis the possibilia kind of thing if you really think about that world precisely because no apparent authority 
saying is worth taking a lot of the things which peer review is meant to do we lose anything 
not having it lb that said there is something valuable about having a means by which nonscientists who might 
interested in science can know where to look for the decent ideas now again that peer review sc or 
scientists in a different field lb yes yes oh yeah exactly or people who just are not expert in 
now of course that peer review is a good way of doing that kind of depends on you thinking 
for good ideas which we previously argued against but even if peer review doing that it is probably a 
idea for something to be doing that and so to speak right now peer review is de facto how 
it maybe a good thing to invest time and mental effort into doing would be thinking about how to 
that in a better way sc okay so one example of the bomb throwing maybe to wrap things up 
should talk about standpoint epistemology lb i was just thinking one example of the bombthrowing the other laughter sc 
think that look i think the case that has been made indubitably over the course of this podcast is 
true knowledge of the world whatever that means is hard is sticky and is not quite as algorithmic as 
high school educations might have led us to believe and once you admit that it opens up a whole 
of things like who decides and how do we decide where the truth is once found it is this 
of i know tell us what standpoint epistemology is but how serious is the connection between this sort of 
sciencey or even philosophical sounding idea and the real practice of science lb right so this is a big 
so standpoint epistemology is a sort of idea which comes out actually comes out of marxist theory but it 
of gets more famously taken up in feminist theory in the late century and which nowadays in the early 
for future listeners sc an optimist at heart lb i think climate sc like century listeners are gonna be 
thank lb i just think climate change gonna kill us quick enough for that to be irrelevant to people 
which nowadays has kind of become a heated topic of dispute outside of just the academic circles where it 
the broad idea stated very generally and very loosely of standpoint epistemology is something like who you are what 
position you occupy makes a difference to what you can know and how reliable gonna be at certain kinds 
reasoning tasks sc so is it really what you can know or how you know it or both lb 
on formulation can be either or both sc okay because what you can know a really radical claim lb 
funnily enough i was going to say that what you can know is the easier one to defend sc 
no okay lb i have insofar as weighed into this debate at all from an old blog post where 
argued that if you look at kind of some of the precise formulation or the more detailed formulations of 
epistemology which exist in internet philosophy encyclopedias or places where people are trying to define it clearly for public 
then it looks more or less just like it looks to be so long as you believe that what 
of experiences had in your life make a difference to what kind of things be a reliable informant about 
some kind of standpoint epistemology is gonna be true right so if you assume that in a very segregated 
but where the say and this is sort of america the black people are going to be the janitorial 
the maid staff for white people then the black people are gonna know both about the black quarter and 
white quarter but the white people gonna go into the black bit of town lb and so if asking 
about this town its layout where things are and got limited time and resources concentrate on the black people 
likely to know especially sort of the black working class people more likely to know about the time and 
of this the structure and layout of this town just they experience more of that sc yeah lb a 
basic example not saying that that would be the most efficient way of finding out about this town but 
is some reason to think that if you are picking an informant in that kind of way a thing 
reasonable correlate for you to look out for is the demographics of who they are and what kind of 
position they occupy sc i mean kind of inarguable that there are correlations between identity markers and knowledge lb 
exactly and so in some forms like standpoint epistemology can more or less just be trying to think through 
implications of that fact and so okay in that case that might make a difference if doing certain kinds 
ethnography or certain kinds of anthropology or sociology of this town and so already while at a high level 
of obvious point like in practice it might make a difference to how you your research design sc yeah 
who you wanna ask things and so even that apparently trivial point can have implications and of the implications 
are sometimes forgot is there are classic examples which i not gonna remember quite right but gonna get you 
broad structure of for early century anthropology where find that anthropologists was literally only interviewing the men in town 
they had some sense it just their own biases they did have some sense that the men were the 
ones who knows up sc partly gotten rid of that lb yeah yeah so partly based on their biases 
also partly based on what informants were telling them about the town except they you know the male informants 
the coherence theory of truths lb but there were times in some of the rituals they were interested in 
the men and women would go into different places and then of course if you only interview the men 
literally just find out about some of going on here and so it sounds trivial but there have been 
when people even that simple correlational point has been forgot and it has been forgot in ways which track 
tending to trust more of those at the top of social hierarchies and that just it does always work 
that lb and so i think even in its very simple form standpoint epistemology can be contentful and important 
actually think another more controversial but i would defend it as the same as this is actually the me 
movement a lot of like the slogan i think a very reasonable explanation of well there are lots of 
explanations of it but one reasonable thing picking up on is if you are going to a workplace and 
wanna know gonna reliably say a sexual predator dangerous here then you have to think of who has the 
to get away with things and the distribution of hetero versus other kinds of sexuality and gonna be just 
heterosexual men have power in office places lb and so mainly going to be women who are going to 
the ones with relevant knowledge and so some strong reason to believe them to trust them they are the 
who know and so again that seems to me to fall out a really contentful point but it falls 
of the quite basic thing now let me say the point where i think standpoint epistemology is nontrivial has 
of scientific and social life and which we could afford to take more seriously there are other versions of 
epistemology which apparently do want to be saying a stronger thing and so often a slogan would be standpoint 
an and this again goes back to the original marxist formulation but it has some of other more modern 
also have this feature wherein the idea that your social position gives you access to certain kinds of knowledge 
meant to be an empirical fact that well these kinds of people who tend to have these kind of 
have also a high rate chance or something like that lb but rather something which is a more substantial 
which is like the proletariat standpoint which is seeing things from the perspective of a worldview properly attuned to 
interests or something like that and seeing things from that worldview will tend to be producing more accurate or 
more informed worldview i think with that one spelling out the content of that standpoint in that sense the 
the property proletariat or or whatever standpoint i think that becomes philosophically much more difficult because you can just 
right what is the true standpoint sc it becomes a little normative also in a different way than simply 
lb in some sense epistemology just tends to be normative trying to say when we say what knowledge is 
knowledge is taken to be a good thing and so if i tell you what knowledge is i am 
some sense saying that have sc fair enough lb succeed by way of belief and this is only kinda 
to do that as well people who have this stronger version will say like the proletariat standpoint or the 
of oppressed women or something like that that standpoint is more successful at knowledge gathering in order to sc 
so an empirical claim that could be tested lb well i not a good spokesperson for this view i 
it sc yeah i know but okay lb but they might not wanna agree with that because it depends 
what you mean by empirically tested because if these standpoints can come apart in what kind of things are 
count as methods of validating knowledge then you might worry that any test you do is sc it would 
to be relative to lb yes be relative to the thing and it will either be circular or biased 
it sc okay lb and sc well then it becomes less interesting to me i mean lb right sc 
just true by construction or irrefutable i guess but just to make it super duper clear none of this 
going to claim that whether black or white or male or female or a cis or trans affects whether 
universe is expanding laughter lb oh no sc or whether you know the universe is expanding right laughter lb 
no sc not like who your identity is affects the truth about the world just not the point lb 
right so i guess some brave soul might wish to argue as much but typically the kind of claims 
are concerned with are the sort of things i spoke about so gonna be about power relations in the 
sc human experience lb human experience like where safe to go in this town if a sundown town that 
of stuff and so usually if you look this is the thing for all of the kind of cultural 
controversy around it often not always but often if you look at the kind of claims standpoint epistemologists are 
in usually sort of independently plausible that the sort of people saying have an advantage of some sort in 
gathering would have an advantage about knowledge gathering in that case i in no means wish to say in 
cases uncontroversial in many cases there are gonna be controversies but a kind of core set of examples which 
will tend to find plausible and then just how far can you expand that rather than whether or not 
are any people usually expand it all the way to like the fundamental forces of the physical the cosmos 
something like that sc well i think that i bring that up intentionally i guess my first exposure to 
in this universe was as an undergraduate taking philosophy courses for the first time and sort of two extremes 
are equally silly one extreme silly in my view anyway one extreme is that super radical view where who 
are literally changes the physical truth of the world and the other is that must be what you mean 
be claiming if any relationship between who you are and what you know about the world right and i 
that the lesson of all that saying here is that there is a difficult but good place to be 
the middle of these claims lb yeah and i know that that way of phrasing things and i think 
right that that is often how the debate is carried out and that way of phrasing things actually comes 
to something we discussed right at the beginning which is a thing which i think philosophical reflection tends to 
to be more careful about is separating out claims about how you know and claims about true and so 
often some of the most heated debate about for instance standpoint epistemology people attribute to standpoint epistemologists who are 
who you are makes a difference to what you know the claim that who you are makes a difference 
true lb and those are very different claims and they should be and one of them is far more 
than the other i mean and so to speak standpoint epistemologists are paying a special attention to social positions 
social positions in the hierarchies of relationships of oppression but in some sense everyone is gonna be a kind 
standpoint epistemologist something like presumably having received a phd in physics puts you in a better position to understand 
reason sc i probably know something lb yeah exactly right chuckle lb so everyone thinks that some life experiences 
gonna be pertinent here the standpoint epistemologists are just drawing attention to a class of experiences of being oppressed 
certain kind of ways which they say make significant differences in these areas so sort of the basic idea 
standpoint epistemology it should be sort of no more foreign to you than saying if someone says that someone 
a physics phd knows more than something without a physics phd about whether or not the universe is expanding 
claiming that whether or not the universe is expanding depends on whether you have a physics phd sc right 
lb the same thing sc well this is good because it makes it sound like i had organization in 
when we started talking and that always makes me look good even if just kind of random lb i 
it sc alright liam kofi bright thanks so much for being on the podcast lb thanks for having me 
music so happy that you had liam on the pod i saw you two interacting on twitter a few 
and was really thrilled about that possibility you are both among the most humble people i know on the 
i really enjoyed this episode thanks love even more getting into the weeds discussing ideas about truth more on 
deflationary viewpoint for instance because that was new to me my big takeaway was thinking about teaching the scientific 
differently a proscience educator and want to incorporate some of this into my teaching it seems like the options 
at using one of the four possible approaches place enough value on inductive reasoning usually we describe our beliefs 
the truth or falsehood of a statement in terms of a prediction of the likelihood that new information we 
yet to discover will change our beliefs about the current state of the world none of these models correspondence 
pragmatist or deflationary approaches really does any work to describe the probability that new information we have yet to 
will change our current beliefs there has been a major breakthrough in creating a commutable algorithm for logical induction 
me this seems much better at defining truth in terms of probabilities it does a much better job of 
predictions about the likelihood that new information will change our beliefs about the state of the world i think 
talking to some of the researchers who contributed to the paper on logical induction would be really valuable because 
theory seems way more practical than what i heard discussed during this podcast httpsintelligenceorgfileslogicalinductionpdf scott garrabrant tsvi bensontilsen andrew 
nate soares jessica taylor with contributions made by abram demski pre publication peerreview as a layman i have been 
to popular physics books the have a sharp us republican idea starting on chapter three in a general consumption 
book a book on theory a kind of sneak attack labor intensive great it weeds out the trouble makers 
have a specific political or ideological view the science propaganda machine is alive and well and idiots like me 
on sean carrol on liam kofi bright industry of all stripes inject proindustry ideas into science attempting to sway 
and the broader public big money on the line go ahead and put it on your blog put it 
line somewhere put it into a discussion with a peer enthusiastic with your view destroy more of institutions they 
public university research using public grad students and professors for private gain on quantum mechanics what if a camera 
pointed at electron the result is on a screen on the camera another camera is pointed at a honeycomb 
spherethat will show the screen in some mirrors and not in others so it can record observations and non 
so it is both looking and not looking just a thought sean or anyone multiverse different farout areas with 
properties affecting the way local physics can work does anyone discuss how there can possibly be bordersboundaries between such 
universes would the stringsbranes containing the extra dimensions simply be of different geometries how can two universes be each 
and would there be strange interactions at the border or no interaction as i understand it the difference in 
properties of a given universe is dependent on the geometries that are holding the tiny extra dimensions if this 
right are the proposed neighboring universes each other in any real sense or can there be no interaction one 
them is inside a black or white hole so there would be an information firewall or something really enjoyed 
episode as for the truth one of the best laughs of my life was when lionel hutz explained to 
simpson that and then yup by the way sentence is manyworlds in praxis so today i used the quantum 
number generator app by crimsonlabs to call up one of my personally curated twenty songs of the playlists of 
i have one for every year from the api was successful and in this world i got it was 
very satisfying in a cerebral way to understand that manyworld variations of me were playing the top twenty of 
year for all the other fiftytwo years at the very same time trusting my parallel selves fulfilled the deal
