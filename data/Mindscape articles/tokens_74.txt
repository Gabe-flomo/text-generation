of you who have been regular listeners are of course experts on what we call string theory the way 
thinking about some physicists anyway way of thinking about replacing point particles and particle physics with little loops of 
string theory purports to be a theory of everything including quantum gravity and all the other forces of nature 
in a previous episode with clifford johnson we explored the basic ideas of string theory and why physicists like 
so much there are of course problems in string theory especially with connecting it to observations one of these 
is that string theory naturally lives in a ten dimensional space time and you can get rid of the 
six dimensions to make string theory look more like our four dimensional world but more than one way to 
that the collection of all the ways of compactifying these extra dimensions is called the string theory landscape and 
single compactification might lead to different apparent laws of physics in our observable world now scientists are very good 
being given lemons and turning them into lemonade so string theorists have said maybe all real maybe this landscape 
different possible ways to get down from ten dimensions to four dimensions all take place somewhere out there in 
large cosmological multiverse string theory was originally proposed as a relatively modest attempt to explain some features of stronglyinteracting 
but before too long developed into an ambitious attempt to unite all the forces of nature into a single 
the great thing about physics is that your theories always go where you want them to and string theory 
had some twists and turns along the way one major challenge facing the theory is the fact that there 
many different ways to connect the deep principles of the theory to the specifics of a fourdimensional world all 
these may actually exist out there in the world in the form of a cosmological multiverse brian greene is

cofounders of the world science festival click to show episode transcript sc maybe this is a good thing the 
goes along to say because maybe certain things that are surprising about our observed world becomes less surprising if 
world is just one of many universes in this large ensemble now not everyone agrees this is controversial stuff 
before we can have an opinion about it one way or the other we have to understand going on 
brian greene has done very influential work on string theory in general but especially on the problem of compactifying 
extra dimensions in the many ways that we think we can do it and exploring their cosmological implications you 
know brian better as a bestselling author his books include elegant and fabric of the among others also been 
host of specials on nova on pbs that explain some of these esoteric ideas and also the cofounder of 
world science festival so i think safe to say that brian greene is one of the most effective and 
popularizers of science especially of highlevel theoretical physics that we have in the world today brian really has a 
gift for explaining very difficult concepts and what we have in front of us sc and the mindscape philosophy 
gonna tell you right or wrong gonna give you the ideas and you can decide for yourself let me 
my occasional note that we love it when people pledge to mindscape on patreon or paypal you can see 
links on the webpage and of course leaving nice reviews on itunes and elsewhere is always a good thing 
this is gonna be both a fun and enlightening episode i hope you enjoy it go music sc so 
greene welcome to the mindscape podcast brian greene thank you good to be here sc this is a special 
for a few reasons for one thing the first live show that bg look at that sc on the 
podcast not technically supposed to be a live show but sitting here in columbia university in office and several 
his students are hanging around listening to what we have to say so maybe be laughter or jokes applause 
what shooting for guys laughter sc alright so i actually did an interview with clifford johnson fairly recently where 
did the history and motivation of string theory so going to proceed under the assumption that all the listeners 
have absorbed all of that and they know what string theory is but just to be safe why we 
the basic story of the particular feature of extra dimensions in string theory and what supposed to do about 
bg yeah sure so again not to cover ground that you already covered with clifford but the basic idea 
that einstein had this dream of a unified theory that would put our understanding of everything in some sense 
into a single theoretical framework and he died without finding that unified theory but then in the late and 
idea of string theory came along which suggested a possible way of putting all of forces together in a 
mechanical framework which is actually even beyond what einstein actually had in mind and when people studied the equations 
the theory they found somewhat surprisingly that the math only was internally consistent if the universe had more than 
dimensions of space and depending on exactly when you look at the theory in the timeline of unfolding the 
number of dimensions that the math required has changed for reasons that we completely understand not as though someone 
some dice around to figure out what the number of dimensions is but the question that you ask is 
in the world do you do with a theory that says that there are more than three dimensions of 
sc people of weaker constitutions would say there are three dimensions of space string theory predicts there are nine 
whatever therefore the theory is chuckle bg they may not only have a weaker constitutions they may be much 
than generations of physicists who perhaps have been wasting their time on the possibility that there really are these 
dimensions but the reason why not willing to so quickly discard these theories that suggest that there are other 
is that a we believe that there are ways to make sense of them that is to make them 
with all known observations and b the mathematics that yields this possibility of more than three dimensions achieves some 
least on paper spectacular things sc right bg so with the payoff being huge namely the possibility of a 
theory of gravity and quantum mechanics and the other forces of nature and with the possibility that the extra 
could actually be real and around us right at this very moment willing to entertain that possibility sc can 
just ask maybe this is not a fair question but what is the percentage chance you would put on 
theory being a correct description of nature bg physics by probability yes sc bayesian inference bg a very quantum 
no just being bayesian bg bayesian i agree i agree yeah a somewhat unfair question because i feel at 
moment that we have enough to go on had the possibility a long shot possibility of finding extra dimensions 
at the large hadron collider and nothing turned up but we knew that that was the most likely outcome 
virtue of the fact that the extra dimensions are likely to be so small that the energies required to 
them is so high that the large hadron collider simply have enough power to do so so i would 
would be the gut reaction on whether or not these theories are relevant to the world and if you 
me a slightly different question which is how strongly do i feel about the beauty of the world if 
are extra dimensions is i think spectacular what a wonderful idea that the way you unify the laws of 
is by stepping beyond the dimensions that we know about allowing for a new perspective so to speak bg 
the analogy that people sometimes use is if you look at planet earth with all of the complexity of 
geography and the topography if walking around it looks like a haphazard collection of things but yet if you 
out you see this beautiful spherical earth floating in the black void and how beautiful is that unified theory 
earth that only becomes apparent when you go off into another dimension that is the dimension of altitude of 
so in the same way if we go beyond the three dimensions that we know about of space and 
these other dimensions then all of a sudden it all clicks together into a unified theory deeply satisfying sc 
asking the flat earth contingent to flood my youtube comments just poking the bear right there bg right sc 
even though physicists like to attach probabilities to their theories you do vote with your feet you decide what 
think is most worth working on and is it fair to call yourself a string theorist at this stage 
your career bg yeah i would say so certainly been a dominant theme in the work that done but 
the same time i would say this sometimes described written books too so you know how you can get 
by virtue of the things that you do in that domain sometimes been described as a proponent of string 
sc oh yeah bg and i consider myself a proponent of string theory i consider myself as someone who 
excited about the possibility that string theory is the right description of the world but i reserve judgement to 
base my assessment on observation and experiment sc sure bg and so from that perspective if tomorrow someone came 
with evidence that showed us that string theory was wrong maybe some mathematical inconsistency of the theory or some 
of the world that was fundamentally impossible to incorporate within the theory and could prove that mathematically for instance 
would happily and i mean this in some pejorative way or even some dismissive way or a sarcastic way 
would truly happily move on because like to consider myself as you and everybody else i suspect would say 
after truth and i care what flavor truth is sc right bg i just wanna be wasting my time 
something demonstrably not true and if string theory falls into that category let it go like a hot potato 
but so far it and in part because we have clever ways to hide the extra dimensions from our 
so what are some of those clever ways bg well there are two dominant ways the one that was 
most intensively even going way back long before string theory to the early decades of the century is that 
world could have two kinds of dimensions big and obvious dimensions that are easy to see with the naked 
and those are the ones that we obviously know about leftright backforth updown but there could be other dimensions 
space that are tightly curled up crumpled up into a very small shape so small as the theory goes 
we detect such shapes with the naked eye or even with most powerful equipment so one way all around 
and just too small for us to see and too small for technology to even access bg the other 
is that the dimensions in principle could actually be quite big but unable to probe into those extra dimensions 
of the way that we access the world so we see things with our eyes which are sensitive to 
imagine that photons penetrate into those extra dimensions even though big and even though all around us photons absolutely 
unable to penetrate then again we see those extra dimensions because of that probe being unable to go into 
additional spatial part of the world that is there but unable to access sc and how big could these 
be bg well because gravity is a force highly sensitive to the geometry of space and time in almost 
of these theories gravity can penetrate in some way shape or form into these extra dimensions and that places 
constraint on how big those dimensions can be so in conventional approaches maybe the dimensions might be oh a 
of a millimeter across or something of that sort so that still sounds small but actually enormous chuckle sc 
you and me small but to the quark big bg but actually enormous compared to yeah to the planck 
which is say ten to the minus thirtythree centimeters so the typical size when we look at the equations 
string theory the planck scale as the size of the extra dimensions but a great deal of flexibility that 
with this other way of hiding them from common view sc yeah and so one of the things that 
say sometimes i tell a story and a historical story and correct me if this is wrong but in 
discovered that the universe is accelerating and the simplest explanation we have for that is that there is energy 
empty space itself right that there is vacuum energy or cosmological constant and the story i tell is that 
empirical database finding changed the course of string theory is that a fair assessment bg i think a fair 
initially when that discovery was made there was a concern that it might actually rule string theory out because 
energy that referring to people had great difficulty incorporating it into the models of the world that were emerging 
the equations of string theory and that definitely was a strong motivation for people to try to find some 
clever mathematical way of making the equations of string theory align with the observations of the accelerated expansion of 
universe and groups of physicists claimed that they achieved that goal and the community by and large agreed with 
that they had succeeded in incorporating this dark energy this accelerated expansion into the mathematics of string theory as 
today sc yeah bg that perhaps that was accepted too quickly sc too hasty yeah bg yeah and so 
are now and this is a sign of a healthy field reevaluating the state of the theory relative to 
observations that may impact it so right it did have a significant influence on the course of string theory 
even today is again influencing thinking for a second round if you will to try to make sure that 
theory is actually compatible with the observations sc yeah and just in saying that actually i realize skipping ahead 
excited about talking about cosmology and so forth but we need to get on the table the idea that 
than one way to hide the extra dimensions and those different ways show up in our visible low energy 
right bg yes the beauty of string theory is that not merely a matter of hiding away an embarrassing 
that the theory says that there should be more than three dimensions of space if it was merely a 
of hiding it away i think that people would have been all that excited about this prospect certainly as 
graduate student in the dark ages which sc mumbledy mumble years ago bg yeah yeah a very long time 
when i learned that string theory required extra dimensions and that the precise shape of those extra dimensions could 
the low energy physics that we can observe say at a particle accelerator i thought that was the most 
collection of ideas that i had ever encountered sc yeah bg so my thesis my dissertation was among the 
calculations to take specific shapes for the extra dimensions and extract from them predictions which you see my air 
with my fingers here on the podcast but to try to see whether we could extract some predictions for 
of the world that we might be able to observe like the number of particles that are around us 
even in principle how they interact in their masses so yes there is in principle a wonderful link between 
way you hide the extra dimensions and the physics that you actually observe sc and i remember the specific 
that i thought it was always fascinating was the claim that string theory could explain why there are three 
of matter particles of the electron the muon the tau bg yeah sc who ordered that why in fact 
is the home bg i rabi sc i rabi who wondered who ordered the muon are there other things 
that that people should know about and actually could you even explain that how can the shape of the 
dimensions give us three copies of the electron bg yeah so the idea is you are studying the equations 
string theory as they manifest in a world that has extra dimensions of a very specific shape and the 
of solutions to the equations dictates the number of particles that see in the world around you and while 
might be a little bit hard to picture if not used to solving equations on curved shapes the precise 
that the shape curves on itself has a direct impact on the number of solutions of your equations and 
was found that there is a quality of the shape which mathematicians had long known about it it has 
technical name called the euler characteristic of the euler number but the details of the name really matter but 
quality of the shape dictates the number of solutions so you could go to a mathematician in principle and 
looking for a shape a sixdimensional shape that has such and such mathematical features and the euler number is 
that it gives rise to three generations three collections of solutions to these and that sent mathematicians scurrying about 
some sense at the service of sc yeah bg which is sort of a curious state of affairs to 
up with these shapes and shingtung yau who was actually my postdoctoral advisor came up with a couple of 
that had the right euler number to agree with the number of particles that experimenters had long found so 
dissertation was taking one of those shapes sc yeah bg and then going further and trying to say it 
the right number of particles but it give the interactions of those particles does it give the masses of 
and those are very difficult calculations to carry out but within a certain set of assumptions we pushed it 
and found it agree with what we saw in the world around us but that was a sort of 
proof of principle sc are you saying a falsifiable theory bg well i wish i was i wish it 
because in the when we were doing this there were only five known shapes sc right bg six known 
or so for the extra dimensions and then if that were the sum total of allowed shapes then it 
would be a falsifiable theory you go shape by shape by shape compare it to observation and if it 
fantastic if not you could throw the theory away and move on the challenges historical development through the and 
found more and more candidate shapes for the extra dimensions it grew from five to five thousand to and 
like to say still a double to analyze these shapes because graduate students like those who you guys will 
day be need projects right sc yeah bg so there you go just throw them one shape after another 
ten shapes each bg and then just get it done but when the thing grew from thousands into millions 
billions and depending precisely on how you count a number thrown around not as meaningful as it might sound 
ten to the five hundred is a number that people throw around and just such a huge number of 
shapes that never gonna analyze them one by one sc yeah bg and therefore you know if within there 
is the shape that would agree with all observations and if it does exist how would you even find 
sc right so the hope just summarize where we are so we have this theory that works really well 
ten dimensions but known since the that you can hide dimensions by curling them up and if there are 
a and the way that you call them up tells you not only what particles you have but their 
and this is why string theory involves so much math right the geometry and the topology the extra dimensions 
the particles we see and been coming better and better at finding new shapes and one of the things 
gets affected is the energy of empty space is that right bg yeah right so not just as you 
the masses of the particles and the number of particles but in principle all physical qualities of the world 
be encoded in these shapes for the extra dimensions and various ways that we can mathematically dress them up 
you will but you can still think of it roughly as the shape so not a bad image to 
of the shape as sort of the dna of the universe right sc yeah bg just like the dna 
within our bodies encodes the detailed features of how we appear in the world the precise shape of the 
dimensions determines the detailed properties of the universe itself sc yeah and a dna sequence that is as long 
a human genome a huge number of possible dna sequences right and evolution does not try every one of 
but it lands on one that is pretty good which is us bg yeah right sc and maybe get 
but maybe the universe does something like that bg right sc before we get okay so this thing called 
energy of empty space in string theory where there are extra dimensions you compactify them the shape and the 
of the extra dimensions predicts the energy of empty space but even before we knew about that there was 
thing called the cosmological constant problem we were worried about the energy of empty space even though we string 
so why you tell us about that bg well the cosmological constant is a wonderfully interesting concept had a 
history beginning in albert einstein introduces this term into his equations of general relativity in order that he can 
a universe static he had this philosophical prejudice that the universe be changing at least in its large scale 
over time things in the universe could exist and change and morph but the universe as a whole no 
always was and always would be sc i think also what the observations indicated at the time to be 
bg they did suggest it right so it just out of his head you look up and it seem 
you see anything yeah bg not much is happening out there so the problem though was as others pointed 
to einstein as well his equations seemed incompatible with that view of the universe and einstein had a clever 
of making it compatible which was changing the equations to include a term that in some sense would generate 
repulsive gravitational push to counteract the usual attractive gravitational pull and in that way yield the universe that would 
steady state unchanging over time now when the observations in one thousand nine hundred twentynine revealed the universe is 
einstein sort of smacked himself on the forehead and said wish i introduced this cosmological and he said with 
away with the sc he could have become famous bg right poor einstein smart guy almost and then so 
throws away the cosmological constant but then you fast forward to the observation that you talk about when it 
recognized that the universe is not only expanding but speeding up in its expansion you need something pushing outward 
could that be cosmological constant is a natural possibility that then reappears in the equations and people are fond 
saying even bad ideas turn out to be good sc right bg you just have to wait long enough 
the cosmological constant as a phenomenological tool for making our equations agree with what we observe but the question 
ask is a more theoretical one which is as particle physicists as quantum field theorists using the tools of 
trade had a hard time finding a way within our mathematics to allow to calculate the energy of the 
and find a sufficiently small number the natural number for the energy of space that comes from the wild 
of quantum uncertainty playing out in microscopic domains particles popping into and out of existence the fabric of space 
in wild ways the energy that emerges is huge so we have no trouble getting a cosmological constant out 
our mathematics we have trouble making it small enough sc but more specifically a sum of huge things some 
which are positive and some which are negative right bg right and without very detailed cancellations between the positive 
negative the order of magnitude of that number would be about ten to the whereas the number in the 
units would be sort of on the order of one sc right bg so off by a factor of 
to the one hundred twenty and people are fond of saying the biggest mismatch between the theoretical calculation and 
in the history of science so a big big mismatch sc always felt challenged when i hear that to 
up with a theoretical calculation that makes a worse prediction than that bg worse sc then i could become 
to you yeah bg there you go so an interesting state of affairs where now the observations are saying 
a nonzero value in order to explain the accelerated expansion of space and the challenge for us is to 
up with some theoretical calculation that yields a number not huge small enough to be compatible with observations and 
is something that people still struggle with in a mighty way today sc and there was this belief before 
we found the universe was accelerating that the empirically determined value of the vacuum energy the cosmological constant is 
really small much smaller than it should be therefore probably zero bg yeah much easier to explain the number 
than a number very very close to zero sc yeah bg zero is a beautifully symmetric number and you 
imagine as you were indicating that if some deep symmetry that says a positive value contributing to this number 
a negative value and a symmetry that requires that they be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign therefore 
they combine you get that kind of an argument we could imagine happening but if the nonzero then what 
you do sc yeah bg is it a almost symmetry a partial symmetry is there a way that even 
there is that kind of a structure that it be upset by further contributions that might be allowed by 
quantum equations and so without zero as your anchor really floating off at sea and where been for a 
sc so we that is what we call the cosmological constant problem why is the real vacuum energy so 
smaller than its natural value then once we found what we think is probably the cosmological constant in we 
faced with a new problem in the coincidence problem right bg yeah right because the value is not only 
on par with the amount of mass energy that we observe in the universe from the molecules and atoms 
stars in galaxies and even including the dark matter all roughly on par so why would it be the 
yeah bg that this nonzero amount of this cosmological constant we often use the term energy that we see 
dark or invisible why would it happen to have the value so close with the density of energy from 
matter and energy especially taking into account the fact that the amount of energy in ordinary matter the density 
that changes over time as the universe expands that number gets smaller and smaller and smaller over time which 
that in principle there could be a mismatch in the far future between the amount of energy in this 
constant which may be a number that sc yeah bg as it relates to the amount of matter energy 
the stuff of ordinary existence so why right now today in this epoch are they close to each other 
a problem that people come up with creative solutions for but i think again a mystery sc yeah so 
to put people in the mindset of where we were in before we found this we had string theorists 
were compactifying the extra dimensions and finding different ways to make particles and so forth and apart from the 
theory we still had these general arguments from quantum mechanics and quantum field theory that there should be a 
cosmological constant but it is small for some reason so is it safe to say that most string theorists 
as their task to find a way to hide the extra dimensions that left us with zero cosmological constant 
the end of the day bg yeah say or more of us had that as the goal the goal 
to not only compactify that is make the extra dimensions small but makes them small in just the right 
that it would agree with the particle properties of the world and also at the same time rid us 
this cosmological constant problem by somehow ensuring that the amount of energysuffusing space associated with this theory would be 
because that was what everybody thought the answer would be sc and an even more subtle thing that i 
is it harder to get across but if you would put a string theorist up against the wall in 
thousand nine hundred ninetyseven and said the cosmological constant is not zero is it positive or they would have 
much happier with a negative number than a positive number bg right right there is a clear distinction in 
mathematics between a positive cosmological constant a positive amount of this energy and a negative value for this energy 
again a negative value for energy might lead some to wonder what in the world could that mean and 
the theory of gravity energy really can be positive or negative it sort of affects the way that space 
curves so that really a puzzle for us the positive versus negative side but certainly the math of string 
was much happier with a negative or zero sc or zero bg than it was with a positive value 
there may have even been people in i would have to check historically who might have said we observe 
positive value for the cosmological constant then this theory can be there may have been people who said that 
i certainly have said it at the sc yeah bg but there may have been people who felt that 
sc i do think that there were people who were at least saying that have no idea how to 
a bg right right sc constant in string and then the universe intervened as it so often does actually 
it enough but it does it very pleasant when the universe intervenes in a surprising way right bg well 
even sure how to judge the development in the following sense is it that string theorists are very clever 
such that given a constraint that does come from the universe namely the observation of a positive value of 
cosmological constant they were able to manipulate the theory in order to get that answer or is it that 
theory is a very tight logical structure and it agrees or is able to agree with the observations because 
true description of reality sc yeah bg and the key question right is it the case that string theorists 
just so clever that no matter what you give them even if it turns out to be made up 
find some way of explaining the data or supposed data that you provide or is it that a great 
of the world and therefore if the world gives us this quality not surprising that the theory is able 
explain it sc since not a professional string theorist i can also add that possible that string theory is 
and the string theorists are very clever at the same time chuckle bg well thank you i will accept 
on behalf of the field i will accept that sc so there we are in and the universe rudely 
us that it seems as if the vacuum energy is positive not even sure about that something pushing the 
apart the simplest explanation is the cosmological constant but it could be something more elaborate so string theorists leapt 
action and said gonna try harder to find ways of hiding the extra dimensions that have the property that 
vacuum energy is bg yes sc so how did they do bg well interesting one paper in particular i 
changed most mind a paper called usually kklt after the authors who were responsible for this paper and what 
found is that by throwing everything together that string theory had in its toolbox sc the kitchen sink bg 
kitchen sink the proverbial kitchen sink they were able to combine those ingredients in just the right way to 
at least a strong argument that string theory allowed for a positive amount of this cosmological constant this positive 
energy and with that paper thousands of others were then written riffing on this idea developing this idea trying 
see how this idea might be made compatible with other observations sort of an endless industry that was spawned 
this paper and at the same time it gave us confidence that the theory could actually agree with observations 
that in a curious quandary because if the theory accommodate this observation then either the theory is wrong or 
the observation itself needs further refinement and maybe that version of it the theory would be able to accommodate 
once the possibility of string theory agreeing with those observations was on the table the floodgates were open and 
cheered and went forward sc except not everyone cheered bg yes sc because there was the downside that once 
can find a way of compactifying the extra dimensions that gives you a positive vacuum energy you can find 
bg yeah sc a buttload would be the technical term right bg not sure if i have never encountered 
technical term chuckle but i will add it to my vocabulary yes that did have another effect which is 
that referring to where people recognized that there were just so many ways in which the extra dimensions could 
curled up in principle in a manner that would be compatible with this positive amount of the vacuum energy 
the old dream which certainly motivated me when i was a graduate student and i think motivated many other 
the field the old dream was is a theory that is going to give us a unique description of 
everything that you wanna know about the world will emerge from an industrious careful analysis of the mathematical equations 
dream is therefore at that was the view in the the view radically changed and these papers that were 
to show that the positive amount of dark energy could be explained within string theory because now the view 
are a huge number of distinct ways of curling up the extra dimensions that will be compatible to the 
vacuum energy and the best that we can hope to do is some statistical analysis on this vast collection 
vast landscape of possibilities and perhaps the way that describe our world is by saying there are many many 
shapes for the extra dimensions compatible with all we bg is somehow more likely there are more of them 
agree with our observations than had the observations been different and in that way we explain our universe not 
a unique description of reality but rather by a statistical averaging that suggests that run of the mill and 
ordinary and therefore the likely outcome of this unfolding guided by the equations of string a very different way 
looking at reality sc yeah and then even your tone of voice indicates not quite as satisfying as the 
one bg well yes how beautiful would it sc right bg to have a unique description of the world 
out of the mathematics everything that we know emerges sc and you have to go with a combination of 
theory and the observations right you get to choose bg right and what happens is your aesthetic sense of 
changes over time i think partly guided by the way these theories evolve and certainly some who have suggested 
this landscape of possibilities is even more beautiful because it then eliminates certain class of questions you can always 
of a theory why did it turn out exactly that way right why it turn out somewhat different and 
string theory the answer would be actually it did turn out different it turned out different in many different 
and we are simply one of the vast collection of universes so that question hold the same bite as 
did when there was one unique answer and you questioned why it turned out that way there are many 
one of many actually a run of the mill ordinary expected answer that comes out of this vast collection 
all there is to sc like an arranged marriage you get married first love develops later with this view 
the world bg right you could look at it that way sc but okay when you start using words 
and and so forth now rather than the strict string theory problem we bring in a cosmological problem right 
yes right sc one statement that in the world of possibilities ten to the five hundred or whatever different 
that string theory could be compactified the landscape of possibilities but ask about so which one becomes real or 
many become real and when the string theorists realized they need to think about inflationary cosmology right bg right 
if you have this collection of universes allowed by the mathematics you have to say to yourself there a 
by which one or many or all of them might actually be brought into and where a union with 
cosmology gives you a natural way forward because even before string theorists were talking this language about many possible 
the inflationary folks realized that inflationary cosmology naturally gave rise to more than one big bang if you frame 
that way this inflationary fuel that gives rise to repulsive gravity that drives everything apart but virtually impossible to 
up that fuel completely sc right bg so some of the fuel in some sense drives our big bang 
some is left over and in fact some is created by that very process and that additional fuel gives 
different big bangs at various and far flung locations in a much bigger cosmos a much bigger cosmology combine 
idea with string theory and you say maybe inflation just fuel other universes in the conventional sense of three 
of space maybe it gives rise to other universes that have these extra dimensions too and moreover maybe the 
universes produced by inflation have different shapes for the extra dimensions so now in principle got a mechanism that 
the insights of inflationary cosmology the insights of string theory to suggest an incredibly rich cosmos in which there 
many universes each with a different shape for the extra dimensions and therefore each with different fundamental physics and 
live in one universe with a particular shape for the extra dimensions and not another because the universe in 
that shape gives rise to the properties of the electron and the quarks and the chemistry and the biology 
allows us to exist bg so we are here because the shape allows us to exist here not somewhere 
because of the shapes they incompatible with the chemistry and biology that allows our form of life to exist 
and inflation in some sense went through that same aesthetic shift that string theory went through in the sense 
i believe the original goal of inflation was to say see features of the universe it looks more or 
the same on very large scales so gonna come up with a dynamical mechanism that says why it had 
be exactly that and it was only by examining the theory more carefully you realized like it or not 
else in the universe inflation is still going on and things could look very different from place to bg 
and to be fair some or one of the pioneers of the inflationary theory if he were sitting at 
table would say guys are sc yeah bg he would say now disavow this approach to cosmology because it 
rise to this possibility of other universes a possibility that i consider still to be within the realm of 
sc we can say that paul steinhardt i wanna get him as a future podcast bg good good sc 
wanna get that perspective bg yes and paul and i as of course paul has had these conversations with 
people but had a running conversation an email debate if you will with him over the course of many 
years where the emails became so densely threaded with the back and forth so we had to color code 
to know who said what when and i see his perspective i agree with his perspective as fully as 
proposes it i think that we have to be very careful about theories that propose other universes we have 
recognize that we need a larger mathematical architecture that can really allow us to make predictions within that kind 
larger cosmological framework and i think that we have that on the table sc right bg the thing that 
to be further developed i feel that it can be developed paul thinks that it is so far beyond 
we currently stand that that may be wishful thinking and until developed we should not propose this as a 
cosmology i think really where the difference is sc yeah i think fair and i think that sort of 
levels of ambition here right one is i think what we would the highest level is we would like 
make predictions we would like to say this is what you should expect under this but a weaker level 
i think a lot of string theorists are happy with right now which is to say if nothing else 
picture of inflation and the string theory landscape makes it possible that somewhere there will be conditions where we 
live bg right sc so the fact that we live in one of them be that surprising and that 
it or not the anthropic principle right bg yeah and in fact a version of that underlies the gold 
of physics which is the standard model of particle physics we always put forward the standard model of particle 
as a grand achievement of the century in which we could describe the interactions of electrons and quarks and 
particles of that sort and they explain data from the large hadron collider but of course the standard model 
particle physics itself is one of an infinite collection of theories that differ by slight variations in numbers constants 
are within the equations and how do we figure out those numbers sc like the mass of the electron 
so forth bg yeah the mass of the electron the strength of the electromagnetic force the strength of the 
forces and we have no idea what is the explanation for those numbers we take it from experimental observation 
we look out at the world we make measurements we tune our theory in order that it can explain 
measurements and then we go further to make new predictions about things that we yet measured and from that 
maybe string theory should be viewed as one of a large collection of descriptions of worlds and what we 
is we figure out what the right version of that theory is through observation and experiment and in that 
winnow it down to a single description or a handful of descriptions compatible with observation and therefore having a 
many possible universes coming out of the mathematics maybe is not all that unfamiliar because exactly what happens with 
standard model of particle physics sc yeah but okay i should mention that even before we discovered the cosmological 
and the string theory landscape different uses of the word in that sentence but we were talking about the 
constant problem and steven weinberg talked about this possibility of a multiverse steven weinberg one of the leading physicists 
the century and so he tried to make an argument that if there were multiverse with different values of 
vacuum energy from place to place we should expect to see a small but nonzero value in our universe 
you buy that at the time do you buy it now bg well i buy it as an interesting 
of data where under a certain set of assumptions naturally led to imagine that the universe would have a 
cosmological constant whose value actually turns out to be on par with observation i think an interesting sentence to 
able to utter that at the same time many sc and he did it before we saw it bg 
he did it before we saw it so an incredible insightful physicist the grand master of physics still with 
and utterly an amazing job in figuring this way of thinking about the world now at the same time 
have criticized that as the assumptions that were made that certain other qualities of the world would be fixed 
unchanging and only allowing the cosmological constant to be the sole parameter that you dial that turns out to 
a very limited framework and if you relax it then the prediction of the value of the cosmological constant 
also relaxed and need not be on par with the value been observed so all just to say putting 
details aside that yes under a certain limited set of assumptions you can make statements as weinberg did before 
observations were made that are on par with what ultimately was found post facto the belief that you have 
that truly is an argument supporting the prediction is perhaps somewhat sc right bg than weinberg himself might have 
at the time sc and so i think that this is getting us in the right direction in the 
that if you believe that there could very plausibly be this multiverse with different parts of the landscape being 
in the ensemble then certainly from that assumption so you can say somewhere be a world in which we 
but making predictions involves other issues like how much volume of space are occupied by these different possibilities how 
stars form in all of them how many observers form in all of them do we know what an 
is do we know what life is have we made progress on these questions bg yes say been a 
small amount of progress relative to the towering difficulty of the problems that you articulated so not like stuck 
i would say that nowhere near being able to say just a few more details and have finished this 
and really be able to make these kinds of probabilistic statistical statements about physics in a universe that or 
vast cosmology that has all these universes within so yes progress no nowhere near the answer sc and the 
of the worry of someone like steinhardt which is he thinks that there an answer an infinite number of 
you say more of one thing than another you make any predictions whatsoever is that right bg yeah that 
at the heart of it and my own feeling and of course i think many in the field and 
to hear your view is that it seem as insuperable to me sc yeah bg it seems to me 
it seems to me vitally important to make these theories scientifically sound but i see that there is some 
hurdle facing us pretty clever pretty smart as a community and i think that we will be able to 
headway on this sc yeah no i think more or less exactly my view certainly i think that we 
now give up on the possibility of coming up with some principle or some understanding accept the problem is 
good one absolutely and therefore try to solve it not just declare defeat from that surely bg right right 
sc but okay other people worry and i think i know the answer to this myself but hear it 
your voice other people worry that this is just putting human beings back at the center of the universe 
some sense to say that rather than being scientists making predictions and saying what things should be using these 
or environmental selection arguments makes things a little bit too anticopernican too humancentered is that something we should worry 
is it kind of a copout bg no i see it that way at all an observational fact that 
and therefore any successful theory should be compatible with that observation one of many observations of the world that 
theory needs to be compatible with and you use those observations that are most potent at winnowing down the 
of possibility so the fact that we are going to impose on this collection of universes that the conditions 
to allow us to be here to make statements that is just pure logic sc right bg it has 
to do with putting us back in the center of things and again not the only condition that we 
on things one of a grand collection and it may be a potent one in order to make a 
step in slicing down the range of possibilities so i find that a concern at all sc like to 
that not surprised that life grew up on the biosphere or the atmosphere of the earth even though a 
more space in between the planets clearly a selection effect here and okay bg yeah the fact that here 
not on pluto sc yeah bg understandable by virtue of the conditions here versus those on pluto sc not 
a planet you know bg heard that sc yes i did it on a whole other podcast bg that 
be another good idea sc already was mike brown was a previous guest bg oh okay gotcha sc okay 
on the other hand on the slightly more pessimistic side this idea of eternally inflating cosmos going on forever 
large maybe infinite number of local conditions in different parts of it does lead us to some bizarre things 
bg yeah sc my favorite bizarre thing is the boltzmann brain problem bg yeah right sc can you explain 
problem to us and give us your feelings about it bg yeah if you ask yourself in the far 
if just particles drifting around in the void could a random fluctuation of the positions of those particles somehow 
together to randomly yield structure and a nonzero chance that that could happen in enough time in enough space 
kinds of very unlikely coming togethers of particles are bound to happen and indeed the structures could be things 
are familiar to us in fact it could be a human brain just randomly forming out in the void 
particles that are floating around in the darkness and that human brain could have within it memories impressed by 
of the particle configurations right now as i look out in the world i remember a past when i 
a kid growing up and learning quantum mechanics and sc you think you remember a past bg i think 
remember exactly exactly the point because right now all those memories are just configurations of particles right here right 
so if we were to create that configuration of particles it would have the same memories and sensations and 
think that it had a history that never existed so possible that brains could form out there in the 
spontaneously the problem with that and the reason why people like to ensure that the theory gets rid of 
as a prediction is that the reason we believe in the equations is because we believe that we encounter 
supporting the predictions of those equations but if we trust any of our memories we trust our memories of 
data that supported the very theories that lead us to the possibility that a brain floating in the void 
we come into a kind of skeptical nightmare where we undercut the very rationality of thought bg so the 
of many theories is to find some way of not only explaining everything that we see in the world 
us explaining that the conditions allow for human life to exist but also somehow avoiding the possibility that in 
distant future these brains will form in the void sc right bg and if you can do that we 
that the theory has a better chance of being correct because it suffer from this logical skeptical nightmare that 
emerge in theories that allow these boltzmann brains to form sc so should we be worried about the multiverse 
it generically true that in these stories of eternal inflation and the landscape there are more boltzmann brains in 
sense than ordinary observers or do we not know bg well it depends again in some sense at the 
of explanation that shooting for so if happy to say that yes these brains may be out there in 
realms but going to limit our explanation of our observations to the small part of the multiverse and within 
we can tell a selfconsistent story and maybe in our universe within the multiverse perhaps the universe ends before 
for these boltzmann brains to form then much like the standard model that is one of many theories that 
observations this would be one of many universes that explains our observations without running into the skeptical nightmare of 
brains however if looking for the full explanation of reality then that good enough sc yeah bg and in 
full explanation of reality you do face a quandary which is if i say to you did your brain 
the natural answer if you believe in this boltzmann brain scenario is it just formed right now in the 
and all these memories that i have are nonsense or things that never took and an uncomfortable state of 
and you definitely wanna have some way of retorting that criticism of your theory and people have come up 
various ideas trying to make it that the regions in which these boltzmann brains form somehow have a very 
low probability so yes possible but compared to the reality that familiar with just so unlikely that somehow we 
push it to the side but in a universe that or multiverse that lasts forever and perhaps goes on 
sorta hard to make those cuts sc right bg so this it is an issue that needs to be 
sc yeah but it also possible that just at the technical level of mathematics that being a little bit 
glib about these ten to the five hundred different compactifications of string theory is it possible that maybe just 
if they all dissolve away can we hope to maybe recover some more unique prediction for what the universe 
look like bg yeah in fact people have written along those lines i had one paper a couple of 
ago which tried to argue that there is an instability in a landscape that most of these other universes 
pretty quickly disintegrate and if that were the case then you have to deal with them on an equal 
because they might be here for a brief moment but then gone sc yeah bg some criticism of that 
and it goes sc no laughter sc usually so polite to each other bg right right yeah but just 
say that yes we may be too quickly accepting the possibility of all these other realms and maybe deeper 
which people are now starting to undertake in earnest might find that yes they are allowed by the most 
analysis of the equations but a deeper analysis allows us to get around them in some way either that 
really there or unstable or somehow our realm rises up with such a fantastically large probability that the others 
somehow be ignored so all of these are on the table in order to avoid this problem of a 
that undercuts its own rationality sc does it seem strange to you that in all of these stories of 
inflation the past of the universe seems so dramatically different than the future bg it does and a question 
know that has troubled you and had conversations about this about this over the years when dealing within a 
whose equations seem to make no distinction between what you call forward in time or what you call backward 
and yet you look at a reality that has such a radical difference between what we humans call forward 
time and what we humans call backward in time that mismatch makes you scratch your head and we have 
scratching it and there are solutions on the table i know that put forward a number of ideas along 
lines i have too now and then not as many or as effective as yours perhaps but it is 
issue that at the moment we pretty much solve by fiat sc right bg we say the big bang 
were highly we know why we know how it came to be but if we posit that then a 
asymmetry that emerges not from the equations but from the conditions and the conditions of low entropy high order 
unfold to a future that has lower order higher entropy and that yields us a distinction between forward and 
but we really put it in by hand not something that emerges from some fundamental principle sc very recently 
been some people you alluded to this earlier but now i guess time to dig into it been a 
set of claims that say know back in one thousand nine hundred ninetyeight when we talked about this kitchen 
construction that gave us a positive vacuum energy maybe we were too bg yeah sc we were a little 
too glib and we could poke holes in that and maybe may be the reason why none of these 
are perfectly convincing is because in fact string theory just let you have a positive cosmological constant can you 
us about this idea bg yeah so when we do analysis in string theory we generally do it within 
approximation scheme we often have the capacity to analyze the equations with a full precision so we ignore certain 
of the equations and try to argue that what we ignore change our conclusions in any deeper or important 
it may qualitatively affect them somewhat but we think the general conclusion would still hold and that was certainly 
approach that was taken in kklt this famous paper that introduced a way of getting the positive vacuum energy 
now have revisited those approximation schemes and called them into question now as far as i know the authors 
the paper fully stand by their paper sc they have not backed down bg they have not backed down 
yeah that is my impression yes bg yeah whereas there are others in the community at least calling attention 
the possibility that we may have all bought in a little too quickly to the approximation scheme that gave 
to those solutions and were that to be the case it would be fantastically interesting obviously it would call 
question over a decade maybe close to two decades of research which again how it goes sc yeah bg 
science is beautiful selfcorrecting no error that will stand the test of time because people always go back and 
think through and always take a sledgehammer to the try to smash results of the past this is a 
that people thought would be impervious to that kind of a sledgehammer attack and who knows maybe it is 
good healthy that back on the table and people are examining it as a possible thing that bought into 
quickly sc but what do we say if on the one hand you say string theory does not have 
solutions plausibly with a positive vacuum energy but the astronomers have observed a positive vacuum energy bg good that 
a natural question and it could well be that this positive vacuum energy might not be constant so observed 
over a relatively short period of time so we know that the accelerated expansion began i know seven eight 
years sc yeah bg and perhaps still going on sc by a short period of time we mean twenty 
we mean a couple of billion years bg a couple of billion years sc yeah bg but the future 
have many more billions of years than the billions that we have so far had access to in principle 
universe could go on for trillions and maybe even infinitely long we know and in that scenario in the 
far future perhaps the case that the vacuum energy slowly decays maybe it gets smaller and smaller maybe in 
very far future it will be gone and those kinds of solutions with a steadily decaying vacuum energy are 
easier to accommodate within our theories so it could be the case that what learning is that the particular 
of positive vacuum energy that we thought was compatible with observations and with the mathematics of string theory maybe 
version is not the one that the universe makes use of nor which the equations of string theory can 
maybe is more subtle version where the energy kind of decays or changes over time maybe both compatible with 
observations and with a more refined mathematical analysis on string theory sc and are you saying that this is 
experimentally testable prediction of string theory chuckle bg yeah sort of interesting how the critics of string theory say 
divorced from observation or experimenting yet here had a bulk of our conversation driven by an observation that took 
in an observation that won the nobel prize a significant observation so it kind of tells the lie of 
theorists ignoring or having nothing to do with observation or experiment but i would say too quick to say 
this is a prediction of string theory we need to understand the mathematics better and we need to go 
to the papers of the late and determine whether or not we agree with that analysis whether that analysis 
to be changed and if it does need to be changed yes it could be the case that we 
out with a prediction that the dark energy the energy of empty space should change over time sc right 
that could be an interesting prediction if indeed this is the way the analysis unfolds sc and it is 
major program of observational bg absolutely sc to test whether this is the case bg absolutely sc spending millions 
dollars bg spending a lot of money to do this and the other thing to bear mind is it 
be that those results are inconclusive sc right bg it could appear that the dark energy is constant at 
level of accuracy that able to muster with the technology that we have at our disposal it could still 
changing sc yeah bg and again the way science progresses so it could be that it requires a one 
or five hundred years into the future before able to actually come up with a definitive observational statement about 
the dark energy changes in time but maybe get lucky sc yeah bg maybe the change is sufficiently large 
be able to detect it and that again will be one of these inflection points in our analysis of 
theory sc okay to wrap things up a couple of more big picture questions here turned on the large 
collider a while ago we found the higgs boson nobel prizes were handed out very happy bg and tears 
shed sc which was a beautiful thing bg yes exactly and tears of joy right sc and of relief 
although tears could also have been shed by the folks who get the nobel prize but were associated but 
that for another discussion sc tears all over bg all over sc but also tears because we found anything 
bg yeah yeah sc right and there certainly is at least an association of string theory with this idea 
supersymmetry bg yeah sc of a hypothetical theory symmetry of nature that could have been discovered at the lhc 
fact maybe next year it will be but it been yet what is your feeling of what learned from 
lack of discovery bg well i certainly frequently when i would speak about these ideas in public settings would 
to supersymmetry as the most likely way that we would have experimental insight into whether string theory was right 
wrong and i think many of us hoped that the large hadron collider would turn up the collection of 
that supersymmetry requires that have never been observed in fact when i do a survey of my own papers 
as sort of one data point since i was a graduate student back in the a significant fraction of 
rely on the idea of supersymmetry so finding it would have been very very exciting for a lot of 
whose worked for decades assumed that it was true now the fact that not seen it is not in 
way proof that string theory is wrong and i say that joyfully sc right bg if it was proof 
back to how we began if it was proof the string theory was wrong i would be thrilled then 
would be time to let the theory go and to move on to other things sc we want to 
the answer bg we want to know the answer sc whatever it is bg exactly and not facetious really 
on how we look at physics as an approach to understanding reality but the fact that it has not 
been discovered and the fact that it may not be discovered in the coming year or so at the 
hadron collider could all amount to the statement that we need a more powerful machine to reveal it that 
is compatible with our understanding of the mathematics sc yeah bg so what i would say is it is 
interesting data point suggesting that the most straightforward version of the theory is perhaps not in agreement with observations 
it in any way give us full insight into whether the theory is right or wrong the theory is 
compatible with anything that will emerge from the large hadron collider over the next year or two sc but 
is worrisome even putting aside specific questions about string theory and supersymmetry that we seen anything else this is 
from a very general particle physics perspective right bg yes absolutely there is general arguments that our understanding from 
equations of the standard model needed something else to emerge at roughly the scale at which the large hadron 
is able to probe the world now that really came in some sense from an aesthetic mathematical sensibility we 
our theories to not be highly tuned we like our theories to be robust against small changes in parameters 
really what led us to this generic notion that there needed to be something else but the standard model 
by itself without anything else could indeed explain the observations i think many of us would find that hard 
stomach from a mathematical standpoint but the universe is not in the business of pleasing our mathematical tastes so 
could be that that just is how the world works and that there anything else to be found until 
much much higher scales where ideas of quantum gravity will make an appearance so i think we need to 
very careful in imposing human mathematical sensibility and human aesthetic sensibility on how the world works sc yeah and 
far as we know no kind of multiverse solution to that problem in the same way that there is 
the vacuum energy right bg correct yes sc yes okay and okay good then the final question is sort 
a state of the union address kind of question string theory has been around a long time the modern 
of the string theory more or less coincides with your career as a physicist right i know what the 
is there but roughly speaking the timing works out bg yeah sc and changed there have been revolutions in 
string theory and i think the impression i get from talking to string theorists and i think from the 
with clifford been an enormous amount of recent effort in applying ideas from string theory to this and that 
different physics problems in nuclear physics or atomic physics or fluid dynamics or whatever what is your feeling about 
prospects for string original hope of being a theory of everything being a quantum theory of gravity bg well 
quite optimistic about its utility in answering those specific questions the unified theory of gravity quantum mechanics perhaps explaining 
particle properties and so forth what i think is completely unclear is the timescale over which going to learn 
it is that theory and if it is that theory the timescale over which be able to extract those 
by virtue of having a sufficiently robust mathematical understanding of a very complex structure so my own sense is 
a possibility that in the not too distant future string theory might migrate out of physics departments into mathematics 
where it will be pursued as an interesting piece of mathematical architecture that cries out for a deeper understanding 
deeper analysis but there may be a phase during which its connection to physics is relatively modest or nonexistent 
hard for a theory of physics to flourish without contact with observation and experiment now we saw again just 
go back to our conversation there can be unexpected links between observation and theory the observation of the motion 
galaxies at first sight be the place look for some evidence or observations relevant to a theory talking about 
smallest things in the world right sc right bg that seems to be the biggest gulf imaginable and yet 
our conversation gone through the history of how there is a link between the two which is exciting so 
would need to have our eyes open and not think that string theory is now sequestered into a more 
part of the academic world but that may be where its development sits for some period of time sc 
crossappointed in physics and math here at colombia bg yes i hedged my bets on that sc safe bg 
sc but in some sense was it too much to ask back in the that we were gonna use 
theory to get the theory of everything and calculate the mass of electron and things like that bg well 
to is an interesting sociological question and i was there at the time and i can tell you that 
notion that we were on the verge of explaining it all come from some pr strategy it was coming 
a genuine excitement sc people believed in it bg about where we might be sc yeah bg so i 
you can criticize people for being excited about things even though probably it was somewhat overexuberant but it came 
a good place it came from a genuine desire to understand the world and i think that is something 
we should celebrate and respect and recognize that tapping into a human enthusiasm and the human urge for understanding 
from that perspective it was pure sc here at the mindscape podcast we do not criticize people for being 
about good ideas bg there you go good glad to hear it sc so brian greene thanks so much 
appearing on the podcast bg my pleasure music there was a particle collider planned in the usa that was 
down by congress europe then built the lhc the lhc has discovered mostly only the higgs boson and failed 
discover most other particles that were thought of congress has been criticized in the usa for refusing to fund 
massively expensive particle collider but have they now been justified in that decision by the lack of discoveries from 
lhc from what read the higgs boson has costed about one thousand three hundred twentyfive dollars europe seems to 
no advantage over the usa or others for having the lhc in their area all for funding scientific projects 
hard to criticize decision at this point i have to say as much as i respect dr greene and 
read all his books he does kinda sorta sound like been trying to fit a round peg into a 
hole dr johnson seemed more mathematical in his approach using the theory to help do difficult calculations granted dr 
knows a whole lot more than i do so no disrepect intended i hope he ultimately turns out to 
correct a delight as always jak in contemplating strings as the basis of all physical reality do not lose 
of the truth that objective reality is dependent on subjective consciousness it may be that strings are the most 
entities of physical reality but because they may be too small to ever be observed they may be forever 
to exist only as mathematical constructs really cool to listen to this podcast as always like to suggest for 
future interview an american string theorist which is living and working in brazil for several years now he proposed 
new pure spinor formalism it should be a cool interview because besides the physics stuff you could also talk 
the challenges of doing research on third world countries such as brazil just an amazing podcast what a treat 
listen to these two folks with such wide ranging knowledge of extremely complicated concepts and the extraordinary ability to 
it clearly to nonscientists thank you so much fantastic and brutally honest conversation thank you i am confused however 
why sean and brian agreed that no kind of multiverse solution to that problem in the same way that 
is for the vacuum energy presuming that the in question is the apparent finetuning of constants in the standard 
why that finetuning also be by anthropic reasoning arising from the dynamics of a multiverse comments are closed sean
