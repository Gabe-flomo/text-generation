hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast your host sean carroll today we want to talk about art 
reality and how art and reality are both mediated through technology our guest is grimes the musician slash producer 
is now i think known as c changed her name to c the letter c after the speed of 
which tickles my instincts i went by grimes for purposes of this podcast because i think the artist title 
the most recent album that come out with sean carroll i think the best way to describe work is 
someone who produces music both literally as the producer of her own albums but she writes the music she 
the music she writes the lyrics and she sings in addition to doing all of that production she says 
wants to go down in history not as a singer or dancer but as a music producer going to 
a little bit about the technique of that sean carroll i think this is a situation where technology has 
to a wide number of people the ability to make their own music grimes started just by firing up 
on her mac and going from there her two most recent albums are visions and art angels which were 
very popular won a number of awards and things like that just now come out with a brand new 
miss anthropocene explain excavate the origin of that particular name here in the podcast and a new single so 
i fell through the earth sean carroll i have to say i like it we play actually several clips 
the music here in the episode so get to see whether or not your kind of thing or not 
is also someone very interested in technology and ai and the digital world for its own sake we talk 
little bit about what it means to live and breathe digitally in fact we get the first insight here 
this podcast into a new project that she just launched with a new digital avatar sean carroll grimes explains 
she wants to really make obvious the fact that who we are in meet space in real life is 
than who we are online sort of a ongoing art project going to have a literally separate digital avatar 
will be her online persona from now on supposed to be an expression of something that we all do 
way or the other not the same person on twitter or in the comment sections of youtube as we 
in person so look at that this is what art does it shines a light on different aspects of 
life it was a very fun conversation sean carroll grimes is not an academic like many of the people 
have on the podcast so instead of a bunch of little potted lectures we actually have a very organic 
that digs into some very interesting issues i think going to like it also stop the recording too soon 
as we reached the natural end point of our conversation we wondered there anything more we should talk we 
keeping up talking so a special promo bit at the end of the podcast that want to stay and 
to go all right grimes welcome to the mindscape podcast grimes thank you for having me sean carroll the 
ever professionally produced podcast had because grimes was just adjusting the levels on our microphones here which never had 
grimes i think i went that deep there though sean carroll all relative and relative to what i usually 
good grimes is it a bit low though you think sean carroll a bit low but okay fix it 
professional let me start with the question sure is on mind what was your favorite episode of the mindscape 
so far grimes going to have to say the one with liv because i know her sean carroll liv 
grimes actually my favorite one was the one with i forget her name the one about ai and greek 
and stuff the techne all that stuff sean carroll adrienne mayor grimes that one really was super fun sean 
that was a little out there one but i loved it grimes so out there but what i loved 
it sean carroll ancient robots grimes that one blew my mind a little bit actually sean carroll androids and 
mythology did you listen to the one with lynne kelly on memory palaces a similar in spirit kind of 
grimes no it is okay sean carroll an australian scholar who number one studies memory you know how you 
build physical structures to improve your memory grimes yes yes yes sean carroll she has a theory that stonehenge 
other ancient things are memory palaces grimes interesting sean carroll because they have books transfer memory through generations through 
giant things you might like that one also grimes okay actually wow i saw the name i was like 
a bit too fun sean carroll a bit too fun grimes now really selling it sean carroll good all 
the physics ones are good too i love the physics ones glad you brought up adrienne one i thought 
that one in a while that was a fun one whenever i do sort of try to secretly find 
science angle but happy to talk about whatever grimes cool sean carroll speaking of which i thought since some 
in the audience might not be familiar with your work others might be your biggest fans start by playing 
little excerpt from a song and then we can dig into how it comes to be grimes cool do 
want to choose the song after the fact or do we want to just why we just play figure 
out and then you play it and then or should we sean carroll going to ex post facto put 
in so we can do whatever we want grimes yes exactly what saying we can just choose it last 
if we so desire sean carroll exactly imagine that violence because i get that thing out of my head 
okay sure sean carroll all right give it a listen there we go for a song like that describe 
it comes to be do you get grimes that weird because that was one of the only songs in 
career that i have not produced just an odd one out sean carroll well it gives you a flavor 
within your oeuvre it fits into your style you think grimes sure i really have a style post style 
carroll okay post style good good we could imagine we played a different song also and then this one 
called grimes kill v maim sean carroll kill v maim it sounds kind of violent grimes pretty violent supposed 
be sort of a name sean carroll kill v maim grimes yeah sean carroll i see kill v maim 
yes this is one thing you do right you have personas are you singing in the persona of this 
grimes yeah i guess so speaking of personas i feel like we could go deep there because been doing 
crazy been making some technological personas sean carroll nice grimes yes this is just a song about i know 
song about better to kill someone or just fuck them up sean carroll do you start with the beat 
melody the lyrics grimes the beat usually yep just like sit down and i know you just get drum 
or you create drum samples and you just build it out sean carroll literally at your computer grimes you 
down at your computer sean carroll imagine the people know nothing about how this happens grimes you sit down 
a computer you open a daw digital audio workspace like ableton live i know if ever seen any of 
sean carroll not grimes have you ever played around with imovie sean carroll yeah a little bit audacity is 
i use for the podcast grimes audacity okay a digital audio workspace just a really great one because very 
you can do a lot then just be get out a little thing and actually play the beat then 
go through and if a kick drum make the low frequency sound nicer and if a snare take out 
frequency that kind of stuff sean carroll what given in the workspace is the individual sounds and you put 
together to a beat or are you given whole beats grimes yes you can construct the sounds from scratch 
you have to or you can buy out a sample pack and get sounds or you can get an 
hundred eight or a hardware and make sounds the way i describe production is sort of probably like what 
used to do except you can actually see it in real time so you have to be able to 
everything basically making the whole thing composing scoring writing the melodies harmonies whatever you are making the drums and 
construct a piece of music from scratch sean carroll is it intentional that you start with the beat is 
a creative choice or just easiest to find the rest of the structure that way grimes i just need 
know the bpm and i cannot compose to a click that work so i need to make the beat 
delete it and make another one better what i usually do is i make kind of a crappy one 
a midi then i do chords whatever blah blah blah make sounds then do weird wordless vocals that are 
blah blah then i go back sort of like a weird religious experience because it feels like sean carroll 
get in the zone of something grimes you get in the zone it feels like being written for you 
you go back and then like a weird puzzle that you go back retroactively and solve can we change 
synth to a much nicer synth or maybe a hardware synth instead of a software synth write lyrics that 
sound like what i was mumbling kind of how it works sean carroll i help but think of a 
austen novel where after dinner one of the ladies would play piano and sing every woman in society had 
have those skills and lost those since there are records and things like that grimes that is interesting because 
used to or a geisha used to be a thing women would be like fucking sorry am i allowed 
swear sean carroll yeah mark it as explicit worry fine grimes got it okay are any of your other 
explicit sean carroll seth macfarlane was swearing like a sailor worry grimes okay cool seth macfarlane i meant to 
to that one because i love seth macfarlane sean carroll what wondering is does this electronics idea help us 
back the idea that all making music people it can be much more widespread grimes i do think it 
be more widespread and the one thing i love about stuff like audacity or ableton or whatever exists super 
music because for a while it used to be in the or whatever millions of dollars to make an 
really expensive to go to a studio record on tape whatever all really expensive still i would say prohibitively 
at the moment for a lot of people but in ten years i think everyone will have access to 
same tools basically sean carroll which part of it is prohibitively expensive grimes ableton is sean carroll the software 
stuff grimes software a computer computers are still expensive a good computer that can actually run i kind of 
a desktop i just be on a laptop or an ipad to actually not super prohibitively expensive but upper 
class vibes at the moment sean carroll changing grimes changing sean carroll that will definitely democratize pretty quickly grimes 
lot of people are making software that is very affordable or very cheap that can emulate really nice hardware 
feel like hitting a singularity point in five or ten years where you need really anything sean carroll by 
you mean things like drums and guitars grimes a really nice microphone or sean carroll okay grimes a really 
preamp or a compressor things that right now it just does not sound as good if you have hardware 
just actually real equipment and emulating it the emulations are just getting better and better sean carroll i think 
this on the podcast several times before because it really did make an impression on me but i was 
an event at south by southwest put on by sony they have an artificial intelligence that will help you 
a melody grimes another thing i really wanted to talk about because i feel like in also the end 
art human art sean carroll okay elaborate on that grimes once ai once actually agi just going to be 
much better at making art than us sean carroll artificial sorry agi grimes artificial general once not just ai 
can do one task or basic things sean carroll not just playing chess grimes once ais can totally master 
and art which could happen in the next ten years probably more like twenty or thirty years i know 
you think actually curious what you think sean carroll well talk about that i just had a podcast with 
mitchell who was skeptical a little bit an artificial intelligence researcher funny to talk to the people in the 
because wide variety of expectations i think it depends on what you do for a living the people who 
try to build chess playing computers and whatever know how hard it is to go beyond that sean carroll 
you suddenly say playing chess but you start without one of your your computer knows nothing it just learned 
certain thing i think that a feeling number one hard but number two well maybe the whole strategy been 
is just not meant to do that and a different strategy might do even better grimes i do feel 
different strategy well i feel like probably get to a point where be building itself and then be much 
building itself than we are which i think already doing at deepmind and stuff sean carroll heard about that 
know you think a likely thing to happen grimes yeah because just be so much better at be able 
do ten years of work in a day or whatever i do think be also a critical point where 
runaway effect and we become irrelevant maybe still far away from becoming what it will be but just get 
sean carroll well i know max tegmark a friend of mine who was trained as a cosmologist as i 
but now doing ai research his project with his students is create an ai which will act like a 
physicist that is to say find equations that govern a set of data and it can be done art 
on the one hand easier to make some art maybe harder to make great art i know grimes i 
but i think ultimately ai will get to a point where it will be able to emulate all our 
all our feelings all our emotions be able to see great art and it will be able to understand 
true innovation is probably even better than we are can sean carroll maybe yeah grimes i think this is 
great and bad but i think part of the reason great is that i feel like in this amazing 
where we might be the last artists ever which feels fun sean carroll the last best artists already the 
best chess players human grimes truly the last chess players already obsolete i guess sean carroll go players i 
how familiar you are with go grimes not familiar with the game but familiar with dennis and stuff sean 
the serious players devote their lives to it they go to go school starting at five years old they 
devastated when the computer beat them because not only did it get better but it played differently it came 
with things that they had never imagined grimes precisely i know go but what people are saying is that 
computer was playing beautifully and artistically why going to be good at painting and writing and probably art forms 
we even thought of at the moment sean carroll one more data point on your side is also from 
douglas hofstadter was her phd thesis advisor he wrote gödel escher bach grimes okay cool i know it i 
it sean carroll he did an experiment he either wrote or found a music writing software ai and had 
emulate chopin then he played for a bunch of people who were classical music fans but not chopin experts 
that and an early juvenile piece by chopin and said one sounds everyone voted for the computer to be 
chopinlike grimes going to be wow more chopinlike interesting not really fair though because he sean carroll it was 
on chopin so not original grimes i think it was early chopin and he not quite totally fair but 
carroll in the direction right grimes in the direction sean carroll this is what saying if on the one 
democratizing our own abilities to make these things but on the other hand we now have competition grimes also 
to run out of i feel like luckily in this sick spot where technology is allowing for new art 
and stuff we are running out of ideas in some regards i feel like ai are going to equally 
things in ways that we enjoy things it will make art for itself and it will just make art 
that are enjoyable in ways that we even conceive of at the moment i think that will be the 
innovation when not even making art for us anymore making art for a new set of standards of what 
good art because yeah sean carroll all right i need to think about that we need to get back 
it but first i want to ask do you use any ai little software programs in your grimes i 
there is actually a lot of ai a lot of ai in everything ai in instagram filters and stuff 
that metric totally i do use the magenta that weird synth i have from google called the nsynth i 
if heard of this i think there is actually some juvenile ai in many aspects of sean carroll okay 
not what i mean not sure what i mean but does ai come into the creativity to the melody 
or the beat creating grimes not at the moment sometimes use a thing that might generate beats but i 
if ai so much as just generative sean carroll just random numbers grimes yeah i did actually recently make 
ai meditations sean carroll you made some grimes yes well actually i make it the ai made it but 
fed sean carroll it was a partnership i presume grimes yes it was a collaboration where we fed it 
bunch of you know with calm and headspace and stuff sean carroll no grimes the meditation apps sean carroll 
think so grimes really you know about these weird meditations these apps you can get on your phone that 
you meditate honestly i started getting into them and i was like this is great just way more calm 
sean carroll okay good grimes then i was this is just creatively the worst shit ever just like your 
weird corporate meditation sean carroll it shuts you down in that way or calms you grimes meditation honestly is 
just the same shit over and over again embarrassing to listen to around other people just some totally white 
yuppie shit just having these weird corporate meditations through an app on my phone creatively an embarrassing experience sean 
i was at a symposium where they began with a mindfulness grimes yes mindfulness sean carroll no do that 
mindfulness is way too wholesome is basically my thought mindfulness is not edgy not cool not dark going to 
this ai with my friend matt aimonetti who built ai a bunch of meditations from these apps and then 
ai started writing these crazy meditations they were so weird and they did actually just get really weird blade 
dark disjointed and they were beautiful they were sean carroll is it sounds or words grimes speaking trying to 
other meditations but doing it in then use a deep fake of my voice this weird version of me 
weird versions of meditations not very meditative it is actually kind of meditative but more unsettling than sean carroll 
mindfulness i think this is a whole new genre that you can invent grimes then what we did was 
started i was like really makes me you know what i grew up in this weird corporate world i 
to say it i love products i love beauty counters i love perfumes and brands and kim kardashian we 
feeding it kim instagram just weird product lists and all this stuff it started making these things that were 
like so calming like girls a great just this weird amalgamation of modernity internet femininity relaxation thing sean carroll 
individual right sure that some people would react in horror to that grimes i think some people will probably 
it sean carroll some people mindfulness the sort of good old western white people meditation is great if it 
them then all for it grimes technically not white people meditate but weird white appropriation of i know buddhism 
whatever the hell it is which sean carroll like you say like you imply once on an app grimes 
on an app officially some weird i feel like at that point the perversion is so extreme that sean 
if it works for people still all for it grimes i love it i use it all the time 
carroll okay good grimes every morning i go opening my stupid app and doing my stupid counting sean carroll 
selfknowledge is such that you know that crosstalk grimes just embarrassed people come in and people are i want 
be able to meditate in front of other people do i need to meditate in front of stop talking 
carroll okay but i want to go back to this ai thing because the thing that i keep coming 
to is the importance for our minds of being in our bodies talked with people on the podcast about 
embodiment of intelligence and so forth i think that one thing that current attempts at ai are really missing 
that embodiment ais get hungry they get sleepy grimes see i think relevant sean carroll i think super relevant 
i just think why does the ai need to be like us also i think be able to emulate 
i just feel like be able to write programs that sean carroll possible grimes we just need to crack 
that is exactly sean carroll in principle we can emulate anything that all in favor of in practice not 
that trying that much grimes i think trying it seem super practical because those are the things that inhibit 
to an extent sean carroll well but you need motivation right they motivate us also grimes true i feel 
ai will be motivated by true interesting okay motivation wow sean carroll ais get bored grimes yeah but see 
be motivated by not being i guess the motivation is the key of whether going to be evil or 
sean carroll well motivation for what goal of course is an important question but the existence of motivation at 
i can turn on my computer and not touch any keys and it will not complain grimes i feel 
going to want to know the nature of the universe sean carroll no i think so grimes why sean 
i think it will just sit there in whatever state in until the command is given to it unless 
give it a motivation unless again grimes once selfaware i think something inherently motivating about being selfaware sean carroll 
so sure very happy to be wrong about this not an expert grimes not an expert either sean carroll 
so at the same level grimes literally just saying stuff never even said before until making it up as 
go along sean carroll i think about just the body is something our bodies unless we feed and breathe 
so forth they decay they go away we are kept in our homeostasis by inputs from the outside world 
that motivate you to do physics sean carroll part of it part of it i think that evolution train 
to do physics as we were talking about before the podcast but it trained us to do other things 
other things sort of bleed over and as spinoffs we are curious about the universe and we end up 
physics grimes art making what purpose does that serve i guess it does serve sean carroll what do you 
i should ask you what purpose does it serve grimes i guess it makes us happy i also do 
science fiction and stuff leads to science sean carroll true grimes an interaction sean carroll what about art i 
grimes like an interaction sean carroll yeah grimes yeah sean carroll but what about i mean but what about 
i mean so if i vaguely know the biography you grow up as a musical prodigy grimes no no 
not sean carroll but stumbled across it grimes yeah i was actually in neuroscience at mcgill sean carroll okay 
montreal yeah grimes yeah and we had to learn logic to do yeah i know make some tones or 
it was like home and then come back on monday with a snippet of something musical to prove that 
learned this sean carroll okay but for a neuroscience class not for a music class grimes for a neuroscience 
yeah just generate tones and various things or whatever and so i went home and just made an ep 
i was just like this is so also free software yes and then i basically just had sean carroll 
were good at it grimes so funny because people were like not that it was easy but people basically 
first music kind of went viral so it was just i definitely work for it my whole life i 
definitely randomly got super lucky sean carroll yep so yeah sometimes well grimes with no musical and then i 
to very quickly learn music very fast in front of a lot of people which was very intense sean 
so what does that mean learning music did you learn to play instruments and things grimes yeah sean carroll 
theory all that stuff grimes i learn music theory i sean carroll the circle of fifths grimes i know 
circle of fifths just to play live and stuff you just have to be good at doing stuff oh 
god better learn sean carroll so really the practice the practical grimes and production my first stuff was very 
fidelity i had to very quickly learn about how to be a good producer and make things sound engineering 
guess because yeah sean carroll so for most of your songs you had written the music played the instruments 
whatever extent that is wrote the lyrics did the singing and did the producing grimes yes sean carroll a 
of work it sounds like grimes fun fun though sean carroll which is the most fun part grimes which 
the most fun part i mean probably the producing cause like weird worldbuilding you make some weird sean carroll 
for those who are again not experts what does it mean to be producing music in the digital age 
it like just modifying sounds mixing tracks together deciding what to include and not grimes yeah basically like cyber 
just got a weird paint graph in front of you that is the song and you just sort of 
it together and put compressors and eqs and effects on things and kind of make it fall together sean 
but you clearly need to know what the words like compressor and eq mean grimes you can i kind 
just figured it out sean carroll you figured it out yeah grimes i was just like just press these 
to get kind of thing and then you eventually just fall into it like i know sean carroll and 
people would be different levels of skill at it but it does sound i mean your story is a 
one in the sense that there might be other people out there who if they were exposed to these 
could really make music other people liked grimes i mean the one nice thing about production is i mean 
do need to know things but you really need to know i mean like the piano if you sit 
at a piano and you press a key it kind of sounds just nice sort of this inherent niceness 
it and you can kind of deduce how to make it nice you just sean carroll i mean hundreds 
years of practice to make pianos that sound nice right grimes okay i mean yeah yeah so sean carroll 
blessed with that grimes the tool set a wonderful tool set available so and so you just need to 
out how to drive the tool set and yeah i think yeah sean carroll when performing live are there 
playing instruments or is it you at a keyboard like a grimes kind of both running certain things off 
and then triggering things off of ableton and blah blah blah and also sean carroll so a little dynamic 
and forth where things are happening by your choice in real time grimes a mix of being actually doing 
and certain things running off of ableton but i used to actually do everything like live loop and but 
playing front of people and trying to live loop something and you fuck something up or one weird sound 
just want to do that definitely learned the hard way not to do that sean carroll i can believe 
i know i go around giving talks about quantum mechanics and i had this one little demo that i 
on my laptop only on my phone so i had to plug my phone into the computer into the 
projector whatever and even that amount of live ability to fail was too stressful for me grimes yeah oh 
i mean and also the other thing i think live music is going to be obsolete soon one of 
things i like about the digital age is well i mean maybe this is bad but i as a 
i hate the potential of failure in front of a giant audience like when you look at djs get 
more than real musicians sean carroll okay i know this i know about the ecosystem grimes and much cheaper 
like actually kind of like instagram or whatever people are actually just gravitating towards the clean finished fake world 
wants to be in a simulation they actually want the real world even if they think they do and 
cool live if you actually look at actual numbers of things gravitating towards the shimmery perfected photoshop world sean 
yeah okay yeah certainly instagram and so forth is pushing us in that direction but there also like if 
look on youtube or whatever or even podcasts my podcast is rather less produced than an npr radio show 
grimes yes sean carroll and still a lot of room there for sort of messy kind of nonprofessional things 
i feel like your guests are weirdly eloquent though sean carroll well true i do try to pick people 
learned that the hard way grimes well i feel like giving you probably a rough time right now sean 
no not at all grimes you think going to have to edit i feel going to edit this like 
sean carroll no not editing it at all grimes oh boy sean carroll this is what going to sound 
grimes okay sean carroll no because the people who are harder to have as podcast guests are the ones 
just give one sentence answers to everything grimes oh yeah sure sure sure definitely sean carroll you want people 
can expound on who go yeah i never thought of that go right that what makes a great podcast 
in all ways grimes well noticed your podcast guests never say not like like just like yeah like you 
like whatever man like what i was like that was just stressing me out on the way here i 
like how am i going to sean carroll you want me to edit out all the likes grimes no 
be able to sean carroll okay not going to do that grimes probably already been but sean carroll well 
think part of the reason i was very happy to have you on the show is i mean interesting 
i want to talk about but also an experiment right a different kind of guest and i just love 
i want to be experimenting i ever want to fall into the rut of doing the same thing grimes 
how i feel about things generally sean carroll yeah so how would you say your music has evolved i 
is it different now then when you were at mcgill grimes oh yeah sean carroll sure the yes but 
oh yeah well i went through so my first album was super weird super psychedelic just crazy and when 
looked back at it at the time i was like i was just totally unhinged psychotic crazy at the 
i was so crazy at the time i realize music had lyrics i thought no one was ever saying 
i thought everyone was just going like blah blah i sean carroll so you were not even a huge 
fan at the time grimes no i was a huge music fan but i was just i think maybe 
think i have some learning disabilities and stuff it was very jarring never watched tv i have the internet 
was just sean carroll no mtv yeah grimes i was just super weird in my world and i thought 
was just making i thought i was making weird pop like britney spears like yes this is super pop 
sean carroll you were trying to sell out this inaudible grimes i was like totally delusional about what i 
actually making and then there was this very jarring thing of everyone being like yeah but cute but she 
be able to grow it up or and people were just really worrying about how i was going to 
the thing and make it not just this one time kind of funny thing and then so i had 
really hone my skills so my last album was i want to say normal because not but it was 
a lot of proving myself sean carroll yeah absolutely grimes production is a very male dominated kind of sport 
so i just i just wanted to make it clear that i can play with the boys or whatever 
carroll yeah that you can play the game in their way in their arena grimes like a level of 
to playing the game you have to actually abide by the rules a little bit so a bit more 
abiding in that album than i liked but i just wanted to shut up the sean carroll well but 
i think i mean never done anything like music but for writing books or for doing physics or whatever 
what the rules are so that grimes you break them sean carroll you can break them grimes exactly sean 
is hugely helpful grimes and now back into major breaking sean carroll back to breaking them grimes yeah back 
breaking because now like done my thing so like no going to be like yeah but can she really 
a real so yeah sean carroll so the previous album was art angels grimes yes sean carroll right so 
are your albums for the people out there grimes well i have two albums that no heard of called 
primes which is a dune concept album but if known i would sean carroll why that box office i 
mean certain people who would love that grimes because insane like the insane ravings of a madman and then 
album called halfaxa which is just a word i made up i have fans at this point i was 
making stuff sean carroll okay but these are things we can get on itunes or whatever or the internet 
yeah sean carroll okay grimes and then my album is called visions and then i made this other album 
angels after that which is kind of my actual breakout album because the first was indie breakout and then 
album was like festival more like i sean carroll people in the audience grimes or i can not actively 
visions era i was still like rent the fuck and now like i can building a studio living my 
now just in my zone sean carroll yeah good good grimes yes sean carroll so the new album is 
grimes called miss anthropocene sean carroll i like it grimes yeah sean carroll explain unpack the layers of meaning 
a funny title grimes well meant to be extremely provocative particularly to my fan base like miss universe but 
anthropocene i just everything like beauty pageants but i want to get into extremely psychedelic beauty pageants actually obsessed 
beauty pageants i love the secret fashion show i feel like this stuff is great it just needs to 
way crazier sean carroll i mean what is it that you love about it the secret fashion show grimes 
just i mean everyone just loves beautiful women and a parade of beautiful women and the weird but miss 
and stuff where they have to answer the questions and just so funny sean carroll the artificiality of it 
of the i mean all grimes sort of this weird attempt to achieve female perfection in this weird way 
is super yeah i know i mean what i really think is that very close to a ready player 
type existence and so imagining the ready player one miss universe where you can have elf ears and giant 
and sean carroll we have to be close to that right grimes a tail and be in a gundam 
carroll well are you imagining just a virtual reality grimes yeah like vr chat sean carroll they must have 
is there no virtual reality miss universe grimes they have no which i really want i really want to 
miss anthropocene into the experimental beauty pageant but anyway and then also like misanthrope i was very sad when 
made this record now i know more i actually but i was basically trying to make goddess of climate 
kind of thing i was like is like the queen of climate change who loves climate change she wants 
the hades of climate just the sickest demon because also i was sean carroll so the one in other 
causing climate change or at least rooting for it not fighting against it grimes or just the embodiment of 
i miss polytheism i feel like polytheism was really cool i feel it was healing for people like if 
like the god of war you can just go like son died but he died for and whatever it 
it more sean carroll the stories were great grimes it makes more sense yeah the stories are great and 
i was like who are the new because we have all this new stuff we have plastic and pollution 
plastic surgery and social media the new gods sound sick they sound like like the sailor scouts like these 
demons so kind of where my weird imagination has been going sean carroll alright and so this is i 
not to make it sound too stuffy is this a concept album around that kind of idea grimes i 
so i hate the word concept album sean carroll i know why you grimes so but sean carroll but 
is grimes i mean i always just start with the visual and then i work backwards so just trying 
think of the sickest visual just taking all these things like climate change and beauty pageants and trying to 
them something that fun sean carroll but so you mentioned that in some sense you were not happy when 
this album and did that go into you want to get your frustrations out by imagining that you were 
climate change grimes i mean just when i made the album the album is actually pretty old kind of 
a bunch of new stuff since the album but a bunch of weird stuff happened actually my manager passed 
and stuff so i just i never actually put it out but it was kind of before i was 
a lot of it right before people kind of like got woke i feel like in the last few 
people just they got woke they suddenly care about climate change and so i was just really depressed i 
like that was kind of where i was at sean carroll so we agree that climate change is bad 
we yeah sean carroll this is grimes well i know if i should can i say that i sean 
some of my itunes reviewers are mad that i think climate change is bad but going to stick by 
an official mindscape position that climate change is bad and we should try to fix it if we can 
so on board with that grimes yeah i mean well the argument of the album is kind of that 
change is good but with the purpose of being provocative and sean carroll a little ironic maybe like grimes 
even just sean carroll make us think grimes i just love villainy i care about harry potter i like 
like i care about batman people actually care about the joker and harley quinn like why sean carroll darth 
is much more interesting grimes suicide squad is yeah everyone likes kylo ren the things people actually like is 
antagonist actually interesting to people so i would say a study in villainy i guess and because just sean 
and the lyrics reflect that grimes yeah sean carroll okay why we we can play a clip from your 
tune what is this called grimes this called so heavy or so heavy i fell through the earth sean 
so heavy i fell through the earth grimes yeah sean carroll okay grimes singing sean carroll so interesting i 
i bit my tongue when you said it but confess the first time i heard this song i thought 
you singing words grimes yeah well i do actually have a speech impediment sean carroll it was like cheap 
no but it was just about the cheap little speaker and it just all it seemed like this sort 
a there was a tune and a melody but more atmospheric than other things grimes yes yeah i mean 
sing i enunciate very well this is why i hate when people sean carroll your voice is very beautiful 
but this is why when people call me a singer when people are like singer like actually not very 
at singing and people understand what my lisp is really bad no one can understand what saying people famously 
what saying so not sean carroll okay not had any problems yet but i mean do you play with 
when producing i mean could you make yourself sound like barry white if you wanted to grimes yeah i 
i could if i really want to but i think people would react badly i mean you can kind 
make vocals sound like anything sean carroll like anything grimes you really want to sean carroll yeah but so 
it a conscious choice for this song to make it more backgroundy ambient grimes i kind of wanted this 
enya thing going on sean carroll okay yeah yeah totally grimes yeah yeah so sean carroll and how does 
fit in i mean i know the only song from the album heard i guess unless violence is also 
the album grimes yeah violence is on the album violence came way at the end it was actually supposed 
be for my next album but this a bit older so i was just i just needed to put 
somewhere sean carroll so do you have a bunch of stuff on hard drives that could be many albums 
yeah yeah a bunch of stuff on hard drives although not good to tell people that because then they 
the release and then they keep people are still on i mentioned some track six years ago and people 
constantly tweeted every single day that release and like my god not going to release so i was sean 
well do you is it because you want to improve it or you just like that one or why 
release things grimes the difference between a sean carroll is it business grimes demo to a song is a 
of work and if not into the song anymore very hard to motivate yourself to do that sean carroll 
like writing a physics paper sometimes easy to start sometimes very hard to finish grimes very hard to the 
between i might add the before i die just release all the demos or something but yeah sean carroll 
yeah no i teach my students this or i tell my students to teach themselves because very bad at 
a finisher you get credit for the things the halfwritten papers that are lying in your file somewhere right 
no a really really hard to really hard to finish things sean carroll and there must be a business 
too right there must be people who like we need some grimes yes which is them sean carroll right 
in the room folks because yeah grimes my manager sean carroll very friendly worry grimes yeah sean carroll but 
you happy with album grimes oh i think my best work for sure sean carroll okay cool do you 
that every album has been better than every previous one grimes yes sean carroll okay so progress going on 
hopefully progress going on sean carroll and is i mean do you think because your skills are better or 
a better place or more creative grimes well this one as we were saying like a confluence of my 
are much better but i can go back to being now that i know the rules i can break 
sean carroll right so and that helps you be a little bit more authentic true to yourself a little 
grimes yeah just a bit more it sounds less like other music sean carroll yeah okay grimes yeah sean 
okay grimes which is my ultimate goal is to make things that been made before sean carroll yeah right 
creative person wants to do that right grimes yes yeah sean carroll yeah and you do it entirely obviously 
by things right grimes yes sean carroll i mean do you have favorite influences grimes no sean carroll no 
grimes well i just feel like a boring question for musicians because who will anyone get anything out of 
if i say my influences i bet like no one benefits sean carroll yeah probably more easier to misunderstand 
to actually convey insight that way grimes yes yeah yeah yeah just because the influences even i know yeah 
know a weird a loaded i go down that path sean carroll on wikipedia my web page has a 
sidebar where it says who my influences are and like grimes who are your influences sean carroll wrote i 
i have no idea who grimes mine too and it has this weird literally people in my influences on 
that never heard of point blank like the who the what is sean carroll well i guess so the 
way to say it is none of us grew up on a desert island isolated from the world right 
yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sean carroll we live within this mosaic of stuff and we 
not even know where the influences are grimes yes well like i try to get influences from for example 
these guys making these programs you use like a plug in that you use that generate sound and generate 
and stuff and i try to for example be influenced by them and be like so these guys are 
engineers they spent all this time building these weird tools how far can i push this tool and make 
the core of the thing that trying to like how can i because engineers and so making very interesting 
things that process sound in ways that have never been never been done so like one of the things 
like to do is figure out what can i make of this pure kind of not put on an 
context just shit that can be done how do i take these new instruments and sean carroll i mean 
i have guitarist friends who are gear heads right the latest little wrinkle in the guitar or whatever this 
the software version of that or the audio engineering version of that grimes well you can do things in 
and stuff that you do you can like take wave forms and put them together in super crazy ways 
can do i mean maybe hardware can do all the same processing i know but just really cool stuff 
guys just writing programs that can sean carroll do you think even apart from like ai being creative do 
think that in a period of rapid development of what people can do grimes i think in a super 
i think in one of the great art phases of humanity and i think we even realize it yet 
yeah a bit later but both because of how rapidly the tools are developing but also because of the 
democratization of these tools i feel pretty much never only it been everyone making music since probably the ancient 
of times so like returning to this place where everybody can make music and everybody has pretty advanced tools 
their fingertips and i know i think probably pretty good for the sean carroll and you also do visual 
right you do the album covers grimes yep sean carroll and into fashion do you design fashion at all 
grimes i do design actually working on digital fashion sean carroll i know what that means grimes i think 
all these fast fashion all the stuff like sean carroll vaguely i know about it but not really my 
so like fashion nova or like hm you can go buy something cheap and crappy for thirty bucks just 
to break really fast and go in the landfill kind of for instagram right sean carroll okay grimes so 
right now instagram can map your face and you can do the cool filters sean carroll oh i see 
this is going yeah grimes i think probably will be very soon to just having really great body mapping 
then you can just go spend two bucks buy a dress wear it and no waste not bad for 
environment you can get something you can get haute couture you can get beautiful things that you could never 
i think it will really revolutionize fashion and then also as i was saying once all avatars then people 
going to need clothes for their avatars sean carroll yeah right right and i wonder this makes me think 
where are we going to go with this because we gone anywhere near where we can i know if 
you ever see tron or tron legacy the movies grimes i have not seen tron and this is a 
thing that gets brought up very regularly with me but i should really see it sean carroll i was 
science advisor for tron legacy grimes okay cool sean carroll the recent one grimes fun sean carroll and it 
eh it was fine it was a good movie but it was not great the first one was in 
sense a crappy movie that was really groundbreaking right grimes okay yes yes sean carroll it was the first 
to really be heavily cgi grimes wow okay cool cool sean carroll and the story and everything great but 
was extremely influential whereas i thought that the flaw of the second one was good at cgi now and 
just did all the cgi they did the old movie but way better but they it groundbreaking they did 
to do something different grimes the one thing say about why film sucks right now is just this weird 
expensive to make films so just repeating and making remakes and like just doing more expensive versions of things 
did before which is like really weird and sad and weird that films cinema specifically is stuck in this 
when almost every other art form is blasting off sean carroll well maybe because just a little bit too 
to be this diy in that world right as compared to music or visual art or whatever grimes although 
do think even the new iphones and stuff the camera capabilities sean carroll getting there grimes still though you 
actors still music you can make it alone in a room movies still need at least a bunch of 
minimum acting so but get yeah sean carroll yeah i can certainly imagine having software where you type in 
i want this actor to have these emotions and grimes oh you could probably just get deepfakes of actors 
have them sean carroll sure also do that grimes or just weird renders of actors oh wow sean carroll 
you can make your own movie or you could fix the old movies grimes just write what everyone says 
how they act and then just let them generate sean carroll this is how the phantom menace should have 
yeah grimes yeah okay sean carroll yeah grimes wow sean carroll people do that so yeah i mean art 
just moving really really quickly i mean do you have a vision for the future of art i know 
sounds too big but do you put it this way how much of your approach to art is simply 
a practitioner versus sort of theorizing what all about grimes a lot of it for me is theorizing what 
about and where going to go because kind of where i know i call it social media sci fi 
whatever just trying to use the tools available to make the most kind of groundbreaking ideas or whatever not 
in music or whatever sean carroll do you think going to be releasing albums forty years from now grimes 
i would like to move on from music well actually probably but more casually sean carroll okay yeah just 
fun grimes not as my main yeah one thing doing right now is just built an avatar and about 
about to kill myself and transition so one thing been deep diving on recently is i really think the 
psyche is splitting into two parts obviously like everyone has and i think this is causing people a lot 
problems sean carroll obviously you say yeah okay grimes but well no but like we all have an online 
and spending hours and sean carroll guilty grimes and our sense of self i mean the way most people 
you is online i you before i met you because i knew your digital self sean carroll and i 
make a sort of conscious decision to make my digital self pretty close to my real self but not 
grimes which i remarked upon meeting you because a lot of people sean carroll pretty close to my real 
but not exactly grimes which i remarked upon meeting you because a lot of people sean carroll yeah grimes 
was like you sound i was tripped out i was like feel like in the sean carroll podcast has 
started grimes i take it your voice even sounded compressed or something i was totally sean carroll a motto 
i got kind of tripped out actually i had a brief psychedelic break when we met sean carroll covered 
up well grimes really i think i screamed and grabbed my head but like i think we are not 
emotionally prepared for this and people are they realize happening so the fight between their digital self and their 
self we see all these girls getting plastic surgery because like face look like my face through the and 
what we actually need to accept is that we have two selves now sean carroll right grimes if you 
actively online in any capacity that is a separate entity and like sean carroll and as an artist making 
of that in a way that i am choosing not to and really constructing things online grimes yeah well 
i want to do is another part of this is because i sing and dance people really undervalue or 
most people would describe me as a singer which is probably the last way i would describe myself so 
i want to do is physically separate my digital self and my real self and have my real self 
of step back start wearing a suit sean carroll nice good grimes yeah and and just be like the 
now the dancing puppet is this avatar of me that we just finished it yesterday well i mean we 
need to do hair and still working on sean carroll digital avatar okay grimes yeah so my digital self 
scanned my body we made a perfect scan of me then we augmented it sean carroll so this is 
leaning into the fact that everyone has a separate online persona grimes well and like she can be on 
she can be on twitter she can say things i even say because not even the real me but 
is the real me but like i feel people are always getting mad at me always in controversies and 
canceled and all this shit the impact of getting canceled and stuff it hurts like i wake up and 
god did i do something grimes just like i would love to untether my digital self and my real 
so i have to go through this suffering of people because a weird avatar of me not my whole 
and they just get a weird misplaced soundbite and freak out grimes this happens to a lot of people 
a lot of people have a lot of pain from being misunderstood because people they get a tiny sliver 
you they make an assumption about your whole self and sean carroll right it fit grimes no way to 
the complexity of your whole self in your digital avatar sean carroll i remember there was a insight that 
got as a college sophomore from an english teacher we were reading pirandello six characters in search of an 
i think and grimes that i just love the poetry of that title sean carroll i know yeah grimes 
i have no idea what talking about that sounds fun sean carroll so what he talked about going to 
it for all the english majors out there i apologize but he started talking about how whenever we go 
life all wearing different masks depending on the situation or whatever what i and i think all my classmates 
he was going to go for was this sort of pablum suggestion we wear these masks we should be 
true authentic but what he actually went for was those masks proudly wear the right masks and be aware 
what grimes yeah well the other thing is is we are contextual beings my personality is actually different with 
people you know what i mean and i think sean carroll i think everyone is right grimes i think 
is i think people are always kind of like or dah dah dah but i think it is authentic 
survival mechanism and i think good to break out of brain cycles if always the same if you have 
ideas about yourself you have the same neural pathway again again again like a path to sean carroll and 
might be your neuroscience training talking right because brains are not these little unified egos grimes i love breaking 
neuropath i love when i sean carroll a lot of modules in there fighting with each other grimes when 
find something abrasive creatively dive right in if i hear new music and every time i go fucking kids 
like listening to this sean carroll the kids today yeah all right grimes like deep diving deep diving until 
like and i usually do come to like it and realize why and then i break out of my 
and then like and then i feel sean carroll i always wonder when people who i know and like 
admire or whatever love something and i i figure like am i doing grimes yeah sean carroll right even 
not going to love it at the end of the day i want to know why they love it 
yes sean carroll i want to get it yeah grimes no i think really really important to just never 
that all the new artists bad it might not be tonally your vibe but if popular sean carroll and 
right right grimes if popular a reason probably good sean carroll yeah right okay digital avatar grimes anyway yeah 
the digital about to take over my social media and everything which is going to be amazing because be 
carroll free free at last grimes also just like are expensive photo shoots are expensive fly to new all 
stuff music videos like and music videos are shitty for the environment like have to have bottled water for 
and we have to build this thing just going to go into the trash build a set going to 
in the trash repaint bunch of like we be doing that in the real world sean carroll do it 
the machine yeah grimes and like sean carroll especially because there what literally creating is something digital right a 
grimes yeah just a video like sean carroll so does your avatar have a name grimes i think going 
call it war nymph sean carroll war nymph okay excellent a bit of incongruity there grimes but it might 
sean carroll okay grimes but yeah so being her first name sean carroll is there going to be an 
or how are we going to know that this is now an avatar and not you grimes because sean 
or not your physical embodiment anyway grimes do you want to see what she looks like sean carroll well 
the podcast grimes i want to show you sean carroll i grimes okay sean carroll but by the time 
publish the podcast maybe an image i can share grimes clearly digital sean carroll okay grimes yeah so we 
need to find ways i mean at first we will cointeract and i mean not going to totally disappear 
she can just sean carroll sure but a separate creation right grimes be doing stuff too yeah no i 
think it has a distinct personality i mean we made her elf ears i would actually get the elf 
surgery but probably unwise sean carroll probably you might have regrets i know grimes well a musician if something 
up it could be really bad sean carroll yeah exactly true why freddie mercury never fixed his teeth yeah 
he could sing grimes yeah sean carroll but look authors iain banks wrote straight novels without his middle initial 
then he wrote science fiction novels with his middle initial grimes yes sean carroll right he had two different 
he trying to hide it obviously grimes yeah yeah yeah sean carroll right but like my literary fiction my 
grimes but i think even just your sense of self if you break your sense of self you can 
be so much more creative we get stuck in our ways grimes one thing about the internet the all 
identity and like am and getting used to who i am and like are my people this is what 
relate and like sean carroll your tribe and grimes yeah i feel like good to kind of shake yourself 
of that and vibe into having a different sean carroll okay but the hope sounds like it will be 
for your regular self to have the avatar so this is an experiment going to see if it works 
grimes yeah and clarifying what i actually do sean carroll okay grimes because like when i see beyonce i 
people think trying to be a singer get really good at dancing get really good at singing and sort 
the platonic ideal of what i do but actually what i do is compose and engineer and write and 
want to do also more weird theoretical stuff the singing and dancing i just find another girl and i 
enough money to pay a girl at the time to start it sean carroll to do the singing and 
grimes also you want to control life sean carroll well then milli vanilli right grimes well but then the 
is is that you end up being your own milli vanilli and what conceptually this weird hole been going 
is like i feel like the phil spector to myself just everyday like sean carroll dangerous grimes back on 
stage put on my lipstick put on mascara get and this torturous thing of being something not in the 
of myself and it got really weird sean carroll but part of that is just sort of reaching a 
level of success right where been striving for this your whole life grimes yes sean carroll and then suddenly 
life is not what you expected it to be and kind of overworked and stressed that might be true 
lots of people grimes true yeah no i think true which is why people should get digital avatars sean 
well i absolutely believe this might be something i mean is playing advocate is there a downside that people 
less restrained to be polite and constructive if a digital self grimes they already do online sean carroll you 
already past that grimes and already very easy if you want to be mad make a troll account but 
thing i think is i think troll accounts are healthy i have many troll accounts on which i do 
lot of trolling sean carroll sorry your definition of trolling in this grimes i just defeat sean carroll sense 
my enemies go say mean things to them from an anonymous account sean carroll sock puppets yeah okay okay 
yeah and then i feel so much better afterwards sean carroll i only have one well one account that 
count as a troll account but really not just my politics account because my regular twitter i mind talking 
politics but i want to be constructive i want to do good things but other times i just want 
say like is stupid so i have a separate account for that and it is therapeutic because everyone else 
do that nothing that adding to the conversation grimes yes sean carroll right grimes yeah yeah yeah well i 
therapy also once you do it you get so much less pain from other people because like sean carroll 
yeah grimes not actually this abrasive at all i even necessarily think of these just been much easier for 
to deal with trolls once i started trolling sean carroll well but the neuroscience and psychology of this are 
right grimes yeah sean carroll because human beings are not unified we are messy streams of consciousness of different 
bubbling up and maybe the insight is the technology is giving voice to all these different parts of ourselves 
i mean right now it does seem like mostly impacting people negatively which is scary i just know if 
has to i do think obviously elements in all of this where like if we could distill this we 
make it positive we could kill this part we could make it maybe i might be wrong but sean 
this will be part of your new mindfulness app grimes yeah yeah maybe everyone just needs a mindfulness app 
carroll well i mean so an interesting thing do you think that the digital avatar idea is scalable anyone 
do it someday grimes i think inevitable first of all i think the technology will because right now when 
play a video game you open a character creation sean carroll sure you have an avatar grimes screen and 
a lot of video games you can customize a character so there will just be better interfaces and be 
that probably but allencompassing in the future and you can i mean if played vrchat you can kind sean 
i did second life a little bit did you ever do second life grimes no i do second life 
carroll it was one of the earlier vr environments and it was bad because there was no goals right 
yeah sean carroll so i mean it was i know admirable because you could build a house and you 
have a cat and you could go clothes shopping and whatever but you win or lose so people lost 
in it grimes well i also think sean carroll which is maybe a lesson of some sort grimes i 
so if ever played vrchat i went into vrchat for awhile and it was just a nightmare you talk 
everyone was like woman a woman in the and then there are just all these weird dudes chasing me 
and i was like goals morally align the fact that just no goal and just a bunch of people 
here creates this incredibly predatory environment sean carroll so no incentive for them to be nice basically or to 
even considerate grimes yeah well and because yeah i know why but it was a weird rapey i went 
to get some food and i came back and all been drawing dicks all over my character it was 
kind of aggressive sean carroll wow grimes rapey vibe sean carroll this is very recently or back in the 
or grimes well four months ago when sean carroll okay pretty recent grimes yeah sean carroll yeah call that 
recent wow did they know it was you grimes no no sean carroll or it was just some grimes 
know it was me sean carroll yeah just female was enough grimes it is sean carroll right grimes yeah 
even making a ethical judgment just saying obviously in the real world people behave like this sean carroll right 
grimes although maybe they would i mean maybe in fucking ancient rome they did sean carroll maybe grimes not 
unclear but sean carroll but yeah i mean norms grimes a little bit sean carroll and standards of politeness 
a purpose right grimes yeah sean carroll and they can exist in real life but not online in some 
grimes yeah and then there might be a way to make them start existing online but i know because 
feel like in order to do that you have to maybe make people sign onto the internet with id 
feels weird and starts getting into weird sean carroll well i talked about this yeah stuff with cory doctorow 
is an internet freedom of speech expert hard every rule you come up with you can realize could be 
for this set of right grimes yeah yeah yeah sean carroll should you be able to delete your direct 
you send to somebody grimes i think you should definitely be able to sean carroll well yes but then 
who send harassing emails to other people can delete the evidence right what i said and instantly the exception 
up grimes damn yeah the i mean we are just not yet prepared this is why i wonder if 
an obsolete species and ai is just an inevitable endpoint and we are just stuck in this in between 
where way too primitive for the world built that ai is just an just an evolution of humanity and 
cromagnons right now in a human world sean carroll well i mean maybe this is a good place to 
of bring it all in for a landing heard things like that said before right grimes yeah yeah yeah 
carroll that the way for the universe to invent super intelligent grimes well i think sean carroll machines grimes 
are kind of but just yeah that just an yeah the means by the universe is just trying to 
itself and as it evolution gets better better better and just fast evolution i guess sean carroll but again 
come back to this sort of motivation or goal kind of thing so nick bostrom wrote this book superintelligence 
know this one grimes i read it but aware of it yeah sean carroll yeah i read it either 
i own it and i always wonder like is the definition of intelligence certainly not the ability to multiply 
numbers fast because we already have that right grimes yeah yeah yeah sean carroll is it the ability to 
a love poem or grimes i mean i think sean carroll quantize gravity i know grimes i think a 
of things and they can coexist too not necessarily of the mind that ai will wipe us out i 
if they even have any motivation to i feel like sort of a weird sean carroll yeah well the 
what even counts as a motivation is a very strange question that i think people have really thought about 
think that anthropomorphizing a little bit too much grimes yeah we might be yeah we might be sean carroll 
also think again my uneducated thoughts here that in addition to ai the whole mindcomputer interface thing grimes yeah 
yeah which sean carroll where rather than building separate ais going to modify ourselves grimes i mean i really 
that really sean carroll yeah coming i think coming grimes because also then we just nick book right in 
put it in sean carroll okay but the fantasy and i wonder if it has any basis in reality 
you have to live through the process of reading it to really get it in grimes i think if 
can imagine it possible i think anything is technologically possible sean carroll faster than the speed of light grimes 
know maybe not fine i know but maybe sean carroll the speed of light your middle name grimes yeah 
my sean carroll you should respect this middle name grimes new real name sean carroll okay so you think 
people should be able to violate the speed of light grimes i mean but i know i mean you 
answer this better than me but can we truly trust the laws of physics are actually what they are 
carroll no we so yeah grimes all saying is just i feel like if we time a lot of 
ahead of us sean carroll yeah true grimes i think probably be able to solve anything really like like 
many things that exist now that just the idea of even a hundred years ago working on computers like 
and just everything right all knowledge at the tip of our fingers literally fucking insane and like speeding up 
like five years ago the difference between five years ago and now feels like the difference between world war 
and the sean carroll yeah grimes so i just feel like tripping into this super psycho zone where sean 
are you a singularity person grimes is a is that the idea when sean carroll i think the idea 
the rate of technological progress is increasing and at an increasing rate so it basically hits infinity at some 
time in the future grimes i feel like it will hit infinity i mean i just believe the most 
thing that i can believe at any given time that sounds sean carroll okay a good thing to do 
yeah like would i fight against the most fun possible sean carroll do you grimes because if no proof 
way or the other obviously just going to go for the iain banks future sean carroll yeah how do 
think about your place in this process i mean do you consciously think that sort of exploring these boundaries 
helping us to get to this new place or is it just riding a wave and having a good 
grimes a bit of both i think riding a wave more than i think but i am actively striving 
not just ride the wave but i think all kind of riding the wave more than we think but 
possibly contributing more than we think sean carroll fair we help but ride the wave grimes we help but 
the wave yeah i think everything at the end of the day walks away from ego and self if 
look at ancient egypt and stuff it ends up just becoming a weird conglomerate of everything all together and 
individuals sort of disappear into this time sean carroll memorywise yeah yeah yeah we grimes like what actually survives 
rarely individuals sean carroll true hard to know what survives another thing i tell my graduate students is when 
give a seminar think about what people in the room will remember five years later and they instantly go 
not going to remember anything five years from so why are you giving the talk right that grimes yeah 
yeah wow great advice actually sean carroll is that important to you how remembered in the future grimes it 
and it i mean more fun and interesting to play the game and try to be remembered but not 
emotionally attached to sean carroll okay i think a perfect answer and i think i like perfect answers as 
way to end grimes okay cool sean carroll grimes thanks so much for being on the podcast grimes yeah 
you so much for having me cool sean carroll is there something that we do that you want to 
we could add in or grimes i mean mostly i in the regular press speaker biohaque would be cool 
maybe talk about sean carroll is there anything any sort of correspondence of this digital avatar idea back into 
real world grimes okay let me see if i can backwards finagle it that way i mean one thing 
i know i know if this is quite like that yeah i just sean carroll just say grimes no 
since here going to promote this thing that doing sean carroll look it works both ways very happy to 
this is grimes you have to promote if it sean carroll think of it letting people in a different 
know about something that is cool grimes you could call this the capitalist postscript sean carroll okay concluding capitalist 
in a kierkegaardian mode grimes yeah yeah doing this thing called luxury raving called sean carroll luxury raving grimes 
raving sean carroll my brain heard and like sounds grimes no we could definitely have lectures we could definitely 
lecturers sean carroll lecturing raving grimes here though sean carroll okay grimes called biohaque haque just sean carroll all 
good just because yeah grimes tm essentially what it is is going to have everyone being inundated with red 
first of all i think raving actually it was someone just sent me an article raving is actually good 
your brain yeah the dancing and stuff builds new neural pathways good for sean carroll but for the one 
two listeners who are not ravers where is this going to happen you go to someplace or am i 
in my living room grimes going to happen in miami and going to have the ai meditations there kind 
like an art installation of using the medium of corporate shit to actually just make art that has no 
or just with the ai meditations i even know if actual wellness just using idea of the corporate structure 
stuck in the corporate world now stuck part of being on the internet is sean carroll look selling electric 
on my podcast grimes true sean carroll and kitty litter so grimes true you sell kitty litter sometimes sean 
yeah kitty i have two cats and i love them dearly and so like course going to sell kitty 
one thing that been advertising grimes okay wow sean carroll people are like kitty prettylitter this is a free 
for them invented this kitty litter where when your cat is sick it turns different colors grimes actually heard 
say this before sean carroll yeah grimes okay there you go sean carroll brilliant grimes i actually love the 
ad for them because so different from other ads and the sean carroll just me saying it grimes casper 
stuff some that just keep coming back like even know what the fuck casper or mailchimp just these comforting 
heard so many times sean carroll anyway all cheerful capitalists and going to be in miami doing a lecturing 
grimes ads without being able to purchase things corporate shit wellness but none of it is actually stuff that 
helps you just engaging in the act of being inundated with wellness infrastructure and all this weird shit and 
to be at a rave sean carroll being sold stuff that you buy grimes yeah i mean and it 
benefit and just because obsessed with sean carroll but art i mean the definition of art in some sense 
mean grimes yeah sean carroll true to its form you buy it grimes trapped in this corporate environment so 
do we make it beautiful how do we because i think ads a medium just only been used for 
one thing but a medium that everyone we look at influencers now and do ads and not even getting 
because they want to look like getting paid and they want to look like doing ads because sean carroll 
even know that grimes yeah people keep catching people doing fake ads because the cultural cachet in sean carroll 
then needed wanted grimes yeah so like well this is clearly an art form that people are vibing with 
emotionally attached to so start making it sean carroll so decontextualizing it and making us think about it in 
different way grimes yeah we want to have a perfume counter and just all this stuff and you even 
any of it just there just the experience of products and corporate but in a way that super psychedelic 
artful and weird grimes for example the ai i know what the purpose of them is not very meditative 
of scary more like science fiction in the form of meditation sean carroll a little banksy it reminds me 
when he destroyed his grimes i see i want to have a fake banksy sean carroll yeah the metabanksy 
in my house just going to do a banksy just going to write banksy and tell people banksy sean 
okay yeah grimes i know why saying this sean carroll no because art pushing the boundaries i like it 
grimes yeah so anyway you can cut this out if you need to but sean carroll no i like 
going to stay in yeah i grimes yeah an ad just an ad sean carroll an ad well yeah 
so wondering whether i should stick it in organically or just literally put it at the end as a 
grimes i feel like you should literally put it at the corporate sean carroll already said goodbye and then 
grimes yeah no i think you should make we yeah sean carroll okay i could do that grimes okay 
carroll i can do that i can have fun with it all right should i are we done grimes 
sean carroll yeah this was so much fun oh my god thank you both for this seeing that grimes 
sean carroll had teamed up for a podcast just about spit the coffee out of my mouth in delight 
not really but if i had a digital avatar it surely would have my sincerest amazing conversation i loved 
hear her musical influences which from what i know about her i share a lot of the same influences 
as nin or depeche mode a science minded musician and artist who went to college for a scientific field 
like grimes so once i found out about her i pretty much became obsessed and admire her in many 
i strongly believe we have to do something about climate change and the future of humanity but in the 
time why not have fun and be creative in response to our inevitable fate i look forward to miss 
next year also i personally believe ai will ever be able to account for emotion and art they way 
can machine life is not biological life the soul will never be there enjoyed all the physicsscience episodes of 
podcast but having more variety in guests has certainly been an excellent idea i really liked this discussion with 
oh my god does she talk fast i had to check that i accidentally switch my podcast player to 
done that in the past no problem understanding her at all though what actually prompted me to leave a 
was this during the discussion sean and grimes talked about how having an online persona allows people to let 
other aspects of their personality often in a negative way such as trolling sure many people immediately thought about 
effects as well and certainly one of them first of all not having internet would have meant a lot 
lonely times for myself when i was younger more importantly it allowed me to leave behind my uncertainties that 
hindered me when meeting people face to face the people i met in irc and online game chat know 
i looked how much money i had or even in what country i lived in i really think of 
as having a mask nick to hide behind but in hindsight it most certainly did allow a different version 
me to come forward weirdcoolrefreshing to see grimes on mindscape however you could find music producers who are better 
for the podcast and could speak more about ai in music and music cognition through their work love to 
you conversing with someone like caterina barbieri you might find this interview interesting the peasized gland that controls your 
random thursday has been mentioned here in a preferred radial context wish you had asked her about the storyphysics 
her new name c and her new song thank you for having her i recently discovered her and your 
what are the odds i never listen this type of music but i checked out grimes and am in 
with the art angels album listened to others yet my twelve year old daughter was actually jealous i discovered 
before she did toward the end of the episode while discussing ai you ask is in the ai community 
is defined simply as effectiveness at pursuing its ai safety advocate rob miles has an excellent video in which 
explains why this is the most appropriate use of the term this is so cool i love grimes comments
