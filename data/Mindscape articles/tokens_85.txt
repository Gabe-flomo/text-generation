carroll and if read my book the big picture you know that one of the things extremely interested in 
the project of reconciling called the of the world with the of the world these are terms that go 
to the philosopher wilfrid sellars i learned them from daniel dennett but pretty obvious going on you have a 
image of the world which is the world we see and talk about in our everyday lives a world 
people and tables and chairs but also a world of purposes and meanings and other terms that we use 
describe how human beings navigate this world around us and then we have the scientific image which if a 
is a story of organisms and cells and if a physicist a story of wave functions and particles and 
like that these ways of talking about the world speak very different vocabularies how do we match them up 
each other some of this project is just a matter of doing science but also deep philosophical issues that 
to be resolved sc so today happy to welcome alex rosenberg from duke university a leading philosopher also very 
in this project of reconciling the manifest and scientific images and alex has highlighted a specific example of this 
that most of us never even think about how we talk about history by telling stories about it when 
try to illuminate the events of history we often tell stories about what the individual people there were thinking 
their beliefs were what their intentions were what their goals were and how that explains purportedly why they acted 
certain ways and alex goes through examples from talleyrand to henry kissinger he has a book that just came 
called history gets things where he argues that all of these stories that we tell about history are essentially 
they are fundamentally mistaken from the start because they rely on a certain conception of a theory of mind 
we conceptualize going on in the minds of other human beings ascribing beliefs and intentions to these other people 
sc if only the idea goes we could figure out what hitler was really thinking what he wanted to 
then we would understand why he invaded russia and alex has a couple of arguments against this sort of 
that we even think about kind of view first that been an empirical failure he gives examples where you 
say sure this person was thinking that and therefore the next time this is going to a failure to 
from history by misonceptualizing how we should think about history in the first place and secondly and maybe more 
he argues that inconsistent with what neuroscience tells us about the brain we look at neurons the neurons of 
our brains are composed and we find direct analogues of beliefs and intentions that seem to be how brains 
according to the most modern neuroscience sc so this is an interesting provocative claim not sure that fully on 
with it in fact i tend not to be on board with it but this is something openminded about 
claim to be an expert so i learned a lot from this conversation and i certainly agree that this 
is front and center for naturalists trying to understand human beings if you believe an immaterial soul or an 
mind that tells our bodies how to behave how do we conceptualize ideas like beliefs and intentions if the 
brains are just electrochemical signals between neurons and all just particles obeying laws of physics with no mind pushing 
around heavy stuff but why here on the mindscape podcast so go music sc alex rosenberg welcome to the 
podcast alex rosenberg hi sean you gotta get off the phone expecting a call from terry gross sc oh 
obviously a big cheese now with all of these books been writing ar i sc which ar interview from 
gross sc that will be great be very tickled to hear that but it actually brings up exactly the 
that i thought i would start i would start with something a little bit from left field get into 
and stories and things like that but started this podcast done a bunch of interviews and when i started 
one of my favorite areas to include in the podcast would be philosophy one of my own favorite areas 
yet the first philosopher i have coaxed on to the podcast and not for failure to ask other people 
is there some reluctance among professional philosophers to get out there and chat about their work in the public 
and is this an issue or is it just me ar well i just read a interview with a 
fine metaphysician at mit stephen yablo in which he owned up to the feeling that at least some of 
we do in philosophy sounds so out of touch with reality from what most people are interested in and 
stagesetting required to make them part of the conversation is so arduous that they may be reluctant to do 
you know people in subcultures like to talk to one another already noticed that in fact been about four 
five days since my new book has started to hit the media and there are a couple of websites 
there solon has done something and verge has done something and the twitter feed is beginning to activate among 
who are really offended and in high dudgeon and talking to one another about this and the same cultural 
may occur in all of our academic areas you know if you write a wonderful book or brian greene 
a wonderful book expounding physics in a way that everybody can understand it produces a lot of envy and 
among the physicists and because difficult to do what you do they want to try and perhaps even want 
avoid it and probably the same in philosophy sc yeah but i think that there is this special thing 
philosophy where even though in physics in some sense the subject matter is just as recondite and hard to 
as philosophy we also in physics have this direct tangible experimental stuff to point to whereas in philosophy all 
analyses and ideas that are not completely intuitive at first glance and therefore maybe a feeling that more of 
barrier there to that kinda communication ar well i also think that what you do is so much more 
and interesting and significant than what a lot of philosophy consists in that i think that more selfconscious about 
public than other disciplines especially some of what philosophers do not everything moral philosophy political philosophy these are things 
people ought to listen to what philosophers say more than they do metaphysics maybe not so much sc yeah 
be at a little personal campaign to get more metaphysics in the public sphere even if i am sad 
they call themselves rather than i do anything about that ar laughter very good because we are certainly not 
either sc no speaking of healing i wanna mostly want to concentrate on the ideas in your most recent 
which is about history and how it fools us and how we fool ourselves by telling stories but i 
to know you through the previous book one of your many previous books the guide to reality and i 
that talking about that and the ideas in that book will help set the stage a little bit so 
us about the guide what your goal was there and personally i think that it was not the right 
for the book i mean not really that much about atheism it presumes atheism and then it goes on 
there ar well right and of course the book is about a doctrine that i call and i glory 
the term usually used as a disparaging term of abuse the way used to be another label for the 
that i defend in that book is that is taking empirical science seriously as our best guide to reality 
concluding that it jars so badly with what daniel dennett called following wilfrid sellars the the picture of reality 
common sense gives us jars so badly with that picture of common sense that we have to get rid 
the commonsensical picture of the world so i wrote that book and at the time it was almost ten 
ago now the new atheists were riding high dawkins and christopher hitchens and sam harris and dan dennett that 
agent and my editor both insisted that i had to put the word in the title even though the 
that i wanted to use was the rough and they told me i even use rough because that was 
by the people who do the travel books sc yeah ar so sc that i believe ar i succumbed 
their suggestions and of course in one respect they were right it made for very healthy sales in the 
several years and it get the word out there as a term either of abuse or a badge of 
for the doctrine i wanted to defend and that was the claim that most of the great persistent questions 
philosophy especially the ones that keep nonphilosophers up at night those questions could all be addressed could all be 
by the resources of natural science and biological science and psychological science and that most of the answers were 
disenchanting sc well in the sense that things like consciousness free will morality going to say that our everyday 
understanding of these issues has been dramatically undermined by progress in natural science ar correct sc and your view 
ar yes scientism is generally viewed as the exaggerated respect for the findings of science and the claims that 
the mistaken claim that only science can tell us about the nature of reality and i accept that definition 
you remove the words and sc right so a happy not scientist what would be the noun form of 
ar the trouble the substantive turns out to be we scientistics because of course not scientists the wrong substantive 
the adjective so you use it without a noun sc okay so scientistics so for example just pick one 
take these ideas and make them clear in the minds pick consciousness for example we could do free will 
as well but i like consciousness a little a little bit more substantive discussion we have about consciousness so 
you think that consciousness exists ar sure pretty hard to deny sc well people do right i mean some 
right ar about the only person who is identified and disparaged as denying its existence is dennett his famous 
wonderful book consciousness explained often described by its opponents as but nobody can deny the subjective qualitative aspect of 
of which we have some kind of apparently introspective access and where the denials start is in how much 
it we should take seriously what we can be confident its function is and whether a basis for any 
of privileged knowledge of the nature of reality even about the reality of our own minds sc okay this 
good so i think that everyone knows everyone who is slightly informed about it knows that even dennett does 
deny the existence of consciousness in fact i can tell you a story when i wrote my book the 
picture i included that joke in there that people made fun of book consciousness explained by calling it explained 
and dan asked me to remove the joke from the text he want it repeated even though i agreeing 
the joke he wants it to be very clear that he was not denying the existence of consciousness ar 
surprised and right to argue persistently against that misrepresentation and i still think that that book is probably the 
thing written on the subject inclined to add to it jesse book about consciousness as attention a wonderful further 
but very hard to loosen the grip of our firstperson introspective awareness and that of course is in large 
what my second book is the book that we wanna talk about eventually sc but so can we say 
the same thing just said about consciousness about something like free will do you think that free will exists 
i think that free will does not exist very confident no such thing the arguments against it have been 
us at least since holbach in the century and there are plenty of solid arguments for called the claim 
determinism is true or true enough to deprive us of free will and no way to reconcile determinism with 
kind of watereddown conception of free will in the way that hume and so many other have tried to 
but of course our conscious subjective experience of free will is what deceives us into being unable to take 
view seriously sc okay so i good this is where the phrase i wanna say hammer hits the but 
right ar rubber hits the sc the rubber hits the road yes so unlike so this is where dennett 
i i think would come down on the other side and i think that actually in the majority that 
anything but most working philosophers even those who are naturalists and hard determinants come down in still saying that 
will is a useful concept we should keep around ar so i agree with you i am certainly in 
minority although somewhat increasing numbers i can identify some other philosophers who agree with me but of course this 
the one area where writings though profoundly influential are mistaken and yet they continue to be endorsed by most 
including dennett however you did a profound service to those of us who dispute dennett on this matter in 
wonderful stockbridge massachusetts conference that you organized and which we can all find online to this day i hope 
which discussing this matter i finally got dan to admit that the institution of free will is a concept 
is extremely useful for maintaining social control in such avenues and areas of everyday life as are crucial to 
and cooperation and our own personal safety he admitted as much and that to me was a sufficient concession 
he really hold with the contracausal free will which is the only thing that real free will could consist 
sc well so this i do wanna talk about this a little bit more just so that everyone is 
on what the options are so on the one hand so this was the moving naturalism forward workshop and 
only is it still available online but we finally cleaned it up and available at much more userfriendly form 
that people can find it if interested in it and dan did admit that i think that for him 
a big part of accepting the reality of free will is that it makes society more worth living in 
need to believe in free will in order to be good people and things like that ar be hard 
keep people in jail if we believe in free will sc yeah and not all why i believe in 
will so i wanna at least lay out the options here because you believe in it and a particular 
of a bigger issue which is we can be reductionist we can put it in exactly free will terms 
can be hard determinists happy to be a hard determinist issues about quantum mechanics but we can put those 
and i believe in contracausal free will i think that perfectly okay to talk about a person as a 
of particles and atoms obeying the laws of physics and in that language of talking about them it would 
silly to talk about free will no free will there but i also believe that there are a higherlevel 
ways of talking about people we know where all the atoms and molecules in a person are not demon 
make those hard deterministic predictions about them and our best vocabulary and theory for talking about people is one 
treats them as agents able to make choices and so to me therefore the idea whether you wanna call 
or not the idea that people make choices and they can be held responsible for their actions is not 
useful for social control but actually true the best way we have of talking about people ar well i 
going to interrupt your very eloquent statement at the point where you first introduced the word because inclined to 
that free will is part of a constellation of concepts that we need and that are best for ensuring 
civilized character of social life but you went on to use the word twice in that eloquent play in 
best for telling the truth about the nature of us as human beings our situation and the nature what 
us tick as they say and before that you introduced the concepts of hard reduction and emergentism or at 
rate emergent levels of the description of reality and i think where i need to get off the train 
agree that these concepts are best for matters largely normative and for the preservation of important social institutions but 
make them true and if we follow at the follow at i think what we learned from the physics 
you have so ably expounded for the nonphysicist we keep free will within that description of reality sc right 
i think that very happy to completely ignore all these issues about normativity and social control and all that 
i mean by is really a purely descriptive judgment of what is best so my view of free will 
that it is exactly as real as tables and chairs and baseball and chess it is something that is 
found in the fundamental laws of physics that if you describe the world at the most reductionistic level it 
there but we have other levels that we describe it on i can say that my chair is made 
atoms but that mean that the chair stops existing something that exists at the human level at this level 
description that is useful in the sense that it accurately describes reality in a world of vastly incomplete information 
know where all the atoms are i can still usefully talk about what the chair is and what the 
does i can still use fully talk about what a person is and why making choices and this not 
belabor it too much i just want to say it one last time and gonna disagree right ar so 
used the word at a level of sc yeah ar and i think that i know whether is the 
word or true and false not at a level of now you and i both agree i think and 
crutch of the matter that as i wrote in the guide to reality and i making an original claim 
the physical facts fix all the facts sc right ar and insofar as we all agree to that got 
be an account of the nature of all the facts that there are including the higherlevel facts if there 
any in terms of the physical facts and my belief is that when we know enough about physics and 
the computational power and the cognitive capacities to see exactly how physics fixes all the facts gonna turn out 
there be any room in that factfixing for the fixing of facts of free will sc okay so just 
be perfectly clear you think that chairs exist you think that consciousness exists but you think that free will 
ar yes i think that is a fair gloss on what i have to say sc okay and ar 
back to something that you said way back at the beginning about the reticence of philosophers and their reluctance 
participate in these kinds of debates i think a powerful argument for saying that tables and chairs exist sc 
an argument given by a very famous very smart american philosopher peter van inwagen which people have been trying 
refute for twentyfive years without success but i wanna get into that the kind of recherché metaphysics that gives 
a bad name sc yeah but i yes we should not get into it maybe have peter on at 
point or something like that but my point would be i see a principled reason to accept the existence 
chairs but not the existence of free will i i have more respect for an attitude that says one 
them i get ar alright so chairs and tables are nouns and we see their referents okay and we 
stipulate that there are clear examples of them and what those examples consist in but if you and i 
to identify a clear case of free will right we be able to do that we would identify an 
that somebody undertook and you would say that action was an example of acting freely and i would say 
is not and we would agree on all the facts of the matter about what happened on that occasion 
yet still disagree about the free will question sc got it okay so we can talk more offline about 
but i think that has actually been very clarifying and i hope that people get what the stakes are 
this and important because it leads us right into one of the things you harp on in the guide 
is aboutness which is something i think that nonphilosophers or nonphilosophy fans even take to be something under debate 
knows free will or consciousness are controversial topics but aboutness can one thing be about something else you call 
into question in the guide ar right and of course nobody understood it outside of the philosophical community and 
the philosophical community everybody thought they understood it perfectly well and could refute it in the way dr johnson 
bishop berkeley famously berkeley said that there was no matter there was only ideas and dr johnson kicked a 
and said i refute bishop and everybody understands that that was a puerile misunderstanding of berkeley that simply showed 
ignorance and roughly the attitude i have towards those who want to refute my denials and there i used 
word sc yep yeah see there you go ar and that of course is the problem there is the 
fact that when we make noises as making noises now the acoustical disturbances that move through the air and 
hit eardrums or get translated into a highlow voltage and then eventually acoustical disturbances that hit eardrums that those 
meaning and their meaning consists in their being about the world and about truths and falsities that are made 
or false by the world one of the words that i use much more lately to describe this is 
our language our words our written and our spoken speech is directed at the way the world is arranged 
is a picture of is a very bad word but is most simply illustrated in picturing about the way 
world is arranged and in the case of desires and wants about how we want the world to be 
ar and the question that philosophy has been addressing within philosophical circles for a couple hundred years now is 
what this kind of representation or aboutness or meaning or content could consist in because we know that marks 
a page acoustical disturbances in the air and neural circuitry arranged in our brains they all have meaning they 
all about stuff they all represent the way the world is or the way the world could be and 
great challenge in the philosophy of language and wittgenstein of course was one of the earliest to make apparent 
challenge is to explain what that aboutness content representation consists in sc right ar and just as i think 
room for free will in a purely physical world where physics fixes all the facts i argue and i 
briefly in the guide to reality that no room for content in a world in which physics fixes all 
facts and that leads to a doctrine in philosophy known as the doctrine that i espouse along with a 
few other people but which we firmly believe is the takehome lesson from the revolution in neuroscience over the 
fifty years sc good so i think and sort of segueing into the history book now but still in 
guide you talked about this issue and you bring up the example of a stop sign right the notion 
this red octagon that is along the side of the road is supposed to be about the fact that 
you see it supposed to stop in your car and it show things stopping it naïvely represent the idea 
stopping yet everyone knows what to do i was i guess i was a little bit unclear in rereading 
chapter whether or not you actually were denying that stop signs are about stopping you say they are but 
think that maybe you were just sort of speaking in the indirect speech of ar that wonderful phrase of 
the learned and speaking with the and for almost everything in the guide to reality a takeaway about being 
to continue to speak with the vulgar even though we think with the learned so free will for example 
all attribute moral responsibility to people and that seems to presuppose free will impossible for us to stop doing 
even those of us who are hard determinants speaking with the vulgar but now getting back to stop signs 
used the stop sign as an example to introduce the more fundamental problem the stop sign is a red 
and everybody knows what it represents it represents a sentence variously expressed in english and any other public spoken 
language a oneword sentence the imperative conjugation of a oneword sentence ar and the sign represents the action of 
at that particular place and time within ten feet of the red octagon in just the way that the 
one wordsentence has content and represents and very clear that in ordinary circumstances in speaking with the vulgar that 
know what stop signs mean and we know how they work and we know what they represent and now 
question that we want to address when doing cognitive science when doing neuroscience when trying to figure out the 
details of how the brain works is how there could be states in the brain that represent that have 
that are about the world in the way that the stop sign is about the world or in any 
way ar the example of the stop sign is very convenient for making it very clear what would be 
by any account of how our brain states can represent the world as indeed they must if they are 
have content and meaning and be about the world sc right and but maybe just being too lax in 
philosophical discipline here but i would have said that wittgenstein and others have given us a pretty good account 
what that could mean the sense in which a stop sign is about stopping is that when these things 
we identify as cars go down roads and they come to intersections when these signs are there they tend 
stop and when these signs are not there they tend to not stop and that relationship between the existence 
the sign and the act of stopping is what we mean when we say that the stop sign is 
stopping but you think that account is insufficient ar well if you think that invocation of the concept of 
conferred any illumination on the fundamental question of the nature of intentional content the sort of technical philosophical term 
be happy with the answer you just gave but i never thought that wittgenstein told us anything that really 
us understand or explain meaning or aboutness representation or intentionality he just described the symptomatology what we need is 
understand how the brain works when it conveys carries employs deploys meaning aboutness representation and to wave your hand 
the way in which the word is used in everyday life is not gonna help us understand how possible 
less how actual for the brain to have states in it like beliefs and desires that have representational content 
that problem has been overwhelmingly serious and not one to which wittgenstein or the ordinary language philosophers have contributed 
since physicalism about the mind and the brain became the orthodox of view in philosophy fifty years ago sc 
so if assume that we all are among friends here and physicalists about the mind and the brain so 
believe physicalists about the universe say right nothing else out there the physical facts fix all the facts on 
same side about that is the problem that there is nothing that aboutness could possibly be in such a 
or is it that there is something that aboutness could be but that something is lacking in the relationship 
stop signs and people stopping ar so we could do it two ways we could talk about the different 
that have been made for how a chunk of matter in our brains or a chunk of matter at 
intersection of two streets could be about or represent facts in the world okay and then we could show 
none of the reasonable stories about how a chunk of matter in the world like the red octagon at 
intersection of two streets is about stopping that nothing like that could be true about what goes on in 
brain we could rule out all the reasonable alternatives that people have so far offered for how one chunk 
matter can be about another chunk of matter that is to say how red octagons can be about stopping 
the intersection of streets in a town cars doing so or people doing so chunks of matter or you 
cut to the chase and consider the fundamental profound question of how even physically possible for one single chunk 
matter in the universe some configuration of leptons and bosons to be organized in such a way that it 
just in virtue of its physical organization about pointing at representing picturing some other chunk of matter some other 
of leptons and bosons now i think that the latter is already impossible but willing to walk through the 
alternative attempts to show how it is possible and to try to poke enough holes in them to make 
see that just an illusion sc well but the latter seems stronger than i would want or need i 
in the virtue of its et cetera et cetera seem to be necessary i would yeah i would agree 
not there for us to help ourselves to but this relationship between the systems one sort of symbolic system 
signs and going on in intentions and another system of cars stopping in certain places and that for me 
more than enough to count it as aboutness ar so philosophers have tried to pursue that program ever since 
wrote content and consciousness in and the name of the philosophical program of trying to trying to naturalize content 
aboutness is teleosemantics meaning having to do with purposes and goals and we all understand that meaning is ultimately 
be cached in or something like that and semantics obviously from the attempt to identify the truth conditions of 
whether inscribed in print spoken in speech or somehow represented in the human brain so teleosemantics is the research 
of trying to give a completely natural biological account of how content is possible in the brain and in 
consistent with physicalism with the doctrine that physical fact fix all the facts and there had been sufficiently many 
principle knockdown objections to this program so far as i can see that not gonna work and the only 
in town if not gonna work then either naturalism is wrong and some kind of spooky dualism is right 
ultimately at basement level no intentionality no content or meaning or representation just a useful tool like free will 
right so just to put a bow on this and make it absolutely clear to the listeners going on 
would say that you have recently written a book about how history gets things wrong you would deny that 
have written a book about that subject right ar laughter this is the classic of course refutation of my 
the opponent says believe that there are no sc not too proud ar desire to convince us that there 
no desires you are refuting yourself out of your own well a very on the one hand easy cheap 
on the other hand a serious issue for all of us eliminative materialists how are we gonna deal with 
well probably not enough time in our conversation to begin to explore the difficulties and how they might be 
and one of the reasons i wrote this new book how history gets things wrong was to try to 
at least part of our position so that it its value its payoff its importance for our understanding of 
nature of reality could be made clear without our having to address this selfrefutation problem sc right yeah so 
i find the cheap vulgar selfrefutation problem a pretty good one so then i think that i easily get 
of it myself by admitting the truthfulness of higherlevel descriptions in which aboutness and intentions are all true and 
and there but okay i get it so i just wanted to make people understand they can choose for 
ar not long ago gödel showed us that there was a fundamental incoherence about mathematics about any axiomatic system 
enough to contain all the truths of arithmetic i am not in a position to make the same kind 
claim about our appeals to intentionality and how they work but i sort of hope that at some point 
other we us eliminative materialists could show that an that a fundamental incoherence here sc right yeah that would 
wonderful to show i would put what gödel showed in slightly less grandiose terms i think that he showed 
there are true statements within formal systems that be proven and it really bother me that much a profound 
but i say that the systems themselves are incoherent they can be completely consistent but they have purchase on 
true statement ar yeah sc okay so in the new book to the extent that about anything it seems 
ar laughter sc not gonna let you get off this hook so easily so it seems as if taking 
philosophical point about aboutness and intentionality and combining it with some facts about neuroscience and the theory of mind 
explain to people why the usual way we have of doing narrative history of telling stories about what happened 
history is misleading us is that basically the idea how would you put it ar yes i think that 
the idea not going to say having given up trying to convince anybody including my philosophical confers on good 
from philosophy for my eliminativist views i realized that a much stronger and more convincing case for many of 
conclusions in fact for as much of them as i need can be made from neuroscience from the achievements 
nobel prizewinning neuroscientists who have enabled us finally to understand exactly how the brain lays down information stores it 
deploys it and have shown that the way it does these three things is entirely free from and has 
to do with the theory of mind that communicates this basic intentionality that been talking about and insofar as 
use the theory of mind simply the idea that beliefs and desires that work together to deliver choices and 
insofar as we use this theory of mind to construct stories and narratives both in history and of course 
fiction and other cultural objects insofar as we use this theory of mind engaged in something that has a 
evolutionary pedigree and that was a quick and dirty solution to a problem we faced on the african savanna 
million years ago but which constitute knowledge which cannot actually identify the causal forces that determine human behavior and 
all the history that exploits this theory to deliver its explanations is wrong sc right and so before we 
to the details there i do wanna get to them i wanna give you the opportunity to dig in 
little bit to the neuroscience side of things but you do a great job in the book of providing 
with some colorful realworld examples of how we tell ourselves stories in narrative history talleyrand and kissinger and so 
so remind us of what the sort of ordinary folk understanding might be of what we learn by studying 
stories of history ar alright so my favorite example is in the first two chapters my two favorite or 
the second and the third chapter the second chapter i think is entitled many times can the german army 
the same so the german army invaded france four times in exactly the same place in the space of 
years now how did it do that well the military historians are paid big bucks to try to figure 
to explain the past and to explain the past in ways that will enable us to prepare for the 
and in each of these cases having very carefully explained what it is that the germans wanted and why 
is that they believe that the way to get it was to invade france through the ardennes a dense 
area between belgium and the swiss border having explained that four times nobody on the allied side french british 
american when it came to the battle of the bulge was in a position to make use of those 
because they were always wrong they were always wrong because the conclusions drawn from them was germans will never 
that ar and they did and that should have led at least to humility if not to the claim 
historical explanation even at its best has no predictive or very limited predictive power and then the next example 
one i use in particular to illustrate how the theory of mind works is you may have asked yourself 
many world war ii history buffs do why did hitler do something so stupid as to declare war on 
united states three days after the japanese attack on pearl harbor when he have to and when he knew 
by attacking the united states at pearl harbor the japanese were guaranteeing that the americans would focus on them 
not enter the european war for years if at all and instead by declaring war on the united states 
forced the united states to enter the war and to fight them first before they finished off the japanese 
and that is a mystery which world war ii buffs seek to answer and the obvious explanation is in 
of mistaken or excuse me mistaken beliefs and his unattainable desires and the way which we understand why he 
that is by deploying this theory of mind and a theory which we even have to learn because it 
bred in the bone or absorbed with our milk which we learned as infants and that theory which is 
invisible because either innate or nearly innate that theory is on the one hand the device we employ to 
one one another stories both in history and about our own actions and in fiction and the source of 
failures of history to provide us with any kind of predictively useful knowledge that would confirm its explanations as 
in the right ballpark sc so when you use the phrase of not not a theory of mind different 
have different theories saying there is something we call theory of and roughly speaking the idea that people act 
in their minds there are beliefs and desires and we can try to figure out we can try to 
what those beliefs and desires are and that very very basic claim that you want to call into question 
it gets applied to history in this way you wanna call it to question generally but history provides an 
testing ground for why not a very good theory at all ar right so it used to be called 
the british called and in evolutionary anthropology in cognitive social psychology and neurology especially in the diagnosis and treatment 
autism this constellation of hypotheses that we all carry around with us and use to explain our own behavior 
predict the behavior of others is called theory of and kinda hard to state because a bunch of platitudes 
obvious propositions that everybody already believes from infancy onward and therefore is difficult to sort of extract and express 
cognitive social psychologists have drawn their boxology diagrams of the way this theory works and used it as kind 
the marching orders of a research program to develop an account of human cognition sc yeah good this is 
right place i think to get into the neuroscience of it all so if i were to be slightly 
about it what discovered is that if you were to open up skull and to look into their brains 
would we see any beliefs or desires all we would see are some neurons bouncing electrochemical signals back and 
and a lot more intricate than that so maybe you can fill in some of the gaps for us 
so we if the theory of mind is right then we look into the brain there ought be some 
of structure there not necessarily at the level of a single neuron or a thousand neurons or a million 
after all in a single voxel as the fmri guys talk about it there are neurons and less than 
millimeter by a millimeter by a millimeter when we look into the brain according to this theory there ought 
be divisions portions subunits that deliver consistent observed that operate to store beliefs and store desires and then pair 
together appropriately the right beliefs and the right desires to drive the actions the choices the decisions which people 
and which we explain to one another by speculating about by hypothesizing about what they must have wanted and 
they must believed that led them to do that okay and there this implicit unexpressed probably largely unconscious set 
hypotheses that we deploy to make sense of one another sc and you make ar the theory of mind 
yeah sorry you make the statement electrical signals differ in that seems to be crucial to the argument i 
sure in some sense neurons are just bouncing electrical signals and the electrical signals are all created equal just 
timing and the number of them et cetera changes from situation to situation but what do you take from 
fact what do you gather what is the lesson that you learned from saying neuroelectrical signals are all the 
ar the theory of mind tells us that somewhere in the brain at some level of organization presumably high 
the individual neuron the neurons are interconnected to one another and vast assemblages of them are so organized as 
consist in beliefs and desires and nobody among the physicalists who actually try to understand the nature of research 
cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience none of these people think that gonna find content or aboutness or representation at 
level of the individual neuron they think going to be found at some higher level of organization of the 
just as the software that runs the computers that you and i are using right now operate at higher 
of organization than the individual microprocessors and the argument of my book is that try as hard as you 
you will not you will find higher levels of organization but those higher levels of organization lack the intentionality 
representational content the aboutness that they have to have in order for them to actually implement realize consist in 
examples of these states of belief and states of desire that the theory mind tells us actually cause our 
so the issue in the research program of the science and cognitive neuroscience is to show how the brain 
a theory for mind and the results already achieved in neuroscience suggest that that program will not succeed sc 
so the part that seems pretty clear to me is this idea that whatever we might have hoped to 
in the mind representing things outside not a very literal representation you used the example in the book of 
cells in the mind of a rat trying to find its way around its environment are not arranged in 
grid the neurons that encode in some sense to the extent that happening where the mouse is not a 
in any direct sense ar and not used as a picture by the rat either sc right so yeah 
what does that mean not used as a picture by the ar so the information about the spatial environment 
the rat is recorded in these grid cells which then send signals to another closeby part of the brain 
the and the discovery of these grid cells and place cells is what got the nobel prize for the 
for john and the way they work i suggest is a paradigm for the way in which the brain 
secures receives information from the environment the way it records the way it the way it then stores it 
deploys it and no stage in this process in which the data the information the discharge of neurons and 
of neurons no matter how large these assemblages are constitute symbols representations pictures which some other part of the 
or the whole rat uses in the way that we use the red octagon stop sign to get us 
know that this is the place where we should put on the brakes okay and it turns out that 
of the rat that it use this information as a symbol that represents anything about the world that what 
for the rat also goes for us sc right i mean i guess not i think i get what 
i get the point not quite a piecebypiece way of representing beliefs and desires in going on in the 
more holistic to the extent that it exists at all and therefore you wanna say it really exist at 
those concepts of beliefs and desires are just not the right way of thinking about in the brain i 
think and you need to get into this in detail but going along with my belief in consciousness and 
will and things like that i think that there is a higherlevel description of what goes on in the 
that does not map on to individual neurons which nevertheless makes sense nevertheless has predictive power and is accurate 
some extent and says this person has this belief and that is the reason why they did and just 
make it as explicit as possible you just want to deny that sentences like that should basically ever be 
ar uh probably not exactly so you used to word and what i wanna say is of course philosophers 
long advocated and neuroscientists and cognitive neuroscientists have long hoped to find some kind of a holistic level of 
of the brain that will realize the features that beliefs and desires have to be for the theory of 
to be even in the right ballpark and none of the holistic approaches on the one hand have either 
nor been compatible with physicalism with our commitment to the claim that the mind is the brain that physical 
about the neurons that fix the cognitive facts about thought and on the other hand you are quite right 
say that this theory of mind has been very handy and very useful to us and probably difficult or 
to give up just like free will is difficult and impossible to give up sc we know from a 
of really wonderful evolutionary anthropology and experimental game theory and cognitive social psychology of infants and primates we know 
all three of those things that the theory of mind was an indispensable device that we hit on early 
our evolution when we were still in the pleistocene at the bottom of the food chain on the african 
with a device that we hit on a quick and dirty solution to this huge design problem of surviving 
the face of those megafauna by ganging up on them by finding ways to collaborate and to coordinate our 
with one another and that this device the theory of mind worked super well in those circumstances and those 
circumstances in which we were dealing with a relatively small number of other people in our immediate visual vicinity 
a relatively short period of time that stretch out longer than an hour or so and within those three 
the theory of mind worked pretty damn well it got us from the bottom of the food chain to 
top in less than a million years but the way in which we use it now for predicting and 
behavior of large numbers of people vastly outside of our immediate environment over long periods of time into the 
is a disaster and it explains the poverty and the uselessness for any other purpose except sheer entertainment of 
history sc and this goes along very well with other psychological neuroscientific results thinking of daniel kahneman and system 
and system ar yes perfect sc basically what we evolved back in the savanna was not a sophisticated form 
rational higherlevel cognition so much as a long list of heuristics that got us through the day that were 
oversimplified but in those particular circumstances worked very well and making the point that trying to apply them now 
very different circumstances and probably one could make other points related to climate change or democratic governance or something 
that where also failing ar i have said it better myself the idea of thinking about the theory of 
as heuristic is an obvious one and i wish i had written that into the book although a bit 
and behavioral economics but of course the theory of mind was a great heuristic in the pleistocene not so 
anymore sc so what we do think about when we bring it back to history going from neuroscience back 
these largescale problems so the germans kept invading we kept getting wrong why they did it what they would 
done someone could agree with that conclusion while suggesting a much less dramatic explanation for it just by saying 
got the explanations wrong we were telling the wrong stories about why people did things for different reasons but 
think that the idea of telling a story of motivations and beliefs is off on the wrong foot from 
start so how would we compare if we pretend being scientists now not philosophers you have two hypotheses here 
the wrong stories we be telling stories how do we figure out what are the data we should collect 
choose between these alternatives ar i think the answer to that is really obvious to any scientist we started 
with this hypothesis with this research program of vindicating the hypothesis the way in which we attempt to advance 
research program and vindicate the hypothesis and sharpen it up and enhance its accuracy and reduce its degree of 
is by making predictions seeing whether borne out and then revising our hypotheses in the light of the failed 
so that they will improve and this is of course the recipe that has succeeded in all of physical 
all of chemistry important parts of biology and relatively no part of the psychological science still driven by the 
of mind and zero in history we are no better at explaining and predicting the behavior of other people 
homer was when he wrote the iliad and the theory that we use is the same one that homer 
when he wrote the iliad and if that the description of what imre lakatos called degenerating research i know 
is sc so we even try to figure out what hitler was thinking when he invaded russia or what 
japanese leadership was thinking when they invaded pearl harbor the wrong question to ask ar we certainly should not 
to figure out exactly what proposition was before their minds what would the content of their beliefs were and 
was no fact of the matter if my claim is right about what they believed and what they desired 
have any beliefs and any desires in their heads in their brains but the strategic situation in which nations 
themselves those are crucial matters about which we need to inform ourselves in order to attain national aims and 
and many of the great disasters especially of hubris in planning and in strategery is that the word that 
second favorite president in the sc yeah ar used indispensable but it go by the theory of mind my 
about henry kissinger is one in which i try to show how the disasters of of henry foreign policy 
in some ways the result of his employment of the theory of mind to try to get inside the 
of metternich and castlereagh and talleyrand and czar alexander at vienna in kissinger made his career out of using 
theory of mind to figure out what those guys were thinking about and then telling richard nixon and other 
people that it gave him the recipe for figuring out the right foreign policy to attain their policy objectives 
well he did win the nobel peace prize so in some sense he must have been correct right ar 
i will not grace that joke with a response sc but you do believe that history is worth doing 
seem to be in favor of just a you glanced at it just there in what you said but 
are i wanna call them but there are things to be said about reasons why things happen in history 
would you think of the useful reasons why are more structural materialist the state of the nation rather than 
state of beliefs ar now i use the word use the word there are factors and forces whose physical 
existence is undeniable and which result in vast and less vast changes in human affairs over time history i 
there are lots of great examples of how to do history completely free from the theory of mind and 
examples provide us with real understanding of the past sc right so we can learn lessons from history not 
that ar oh of course not no more in doubt than it was when darwin spent five years going 
the world on the beagle to learn lessons from history that he was able to leverage the theory of 
selection from sc and in fact not even against telling stories per se done it yourself i wanna make 
the audience knows that you have a side hustle as a successful novelist ar a side hustle indeed not 
am i not against telling stories i think as i argue in the new book we stop it telling 
bred in the bone as good as innate never be able to stop we love stories the only the 
way we can really understand things i mean if only i were like you someone who can really understand 
without stories unfortunately like most people i my physical insights are overborne by storytelling much as i try to 
them from doing so so we tell stories we love stories we are entertained by stories and i like 
people by stories and not only do i like it but they sell a lot more than my philosophy 
ar and i also think that great works of history have become classics because of the stories they tell 
because we are so enthralled by them whether decline and fall of the roman empire or winston the world 
his history of the first world war which a friend of his once said winston has written his biography 
disguised as it is beautiful ar this is something they said about him in one thousand nine hundred twentyone 
before he won the nobel prize for literature for having written the history of the second world war but 
stop doing history and we stop consuming it history moves the world the gulag archipelago and mein kampf are 
examples of stories that have had profound effects on the history of the world the trouble is that they 
mostly these stories baleful and nefarious in their impact on humanity and why we need to stop taking them 
sc ar stories right i hope people enjoy my stories but take them as knowledge just as entertainment sc 
let wrap up i wanna give you an opportunity to just be a little bit more explicit about the 
written very very interesting not only the content of your stories as it were but the fact that as 
professional philosopher you chose to write novels after having been on a little bit of a jeremiad against stories 
misleading and i think inconsistent not a i think that explained just now very well that different purposes being 
but tell us about what your novels are about ar very interesting so i wrote the guide to reality 
there were two theses in the guide one that history answers most of the persistent questions of philosophy and 
much believe that and the second was that narrative explanations are worthless and nobody even understood that let alone 
it so i decided i had to communicate this idea a different way and the way i was gonna 
it was by fighting a narrative so i wrote the girl from krakow a cleverly disguised bit of philosophical 
and i got an agent and my agent got a publisher and between them they cut threequarters of the 
out of the novel including most of the jeremiads against narrative and most of the arguments in favor of 
although i use the word in a book set between one thousand nine hundred thirtyfive and it would have 
a total anachronism and to my great surprise this novel shorn of twothirds of its darwinism atheism nihilism shorn 
twothirds of those features sold copies sc my god ar objection that people had to it was the lesbianism 
hundred or two hundred of the reviews on amazoncom have complained largely christians complaining about the lesbianism and hoping 
moral uplift and they find any sc more eliminativism less lesbianism yeah ar yeah so i wrote this book 
it was this phenomenal success and there are some personal aspects to the book a fictionalized account of my 
in world war ii experiences so deeply disturbing that i had to actually the wrong word had sc soften 
a bit ar soften them up from her own memoir which i worked on edited and which was published 
twentyfive years ago and then i wrote another novel and this one had a different kind of agenda there 
was trying to show how the american right wing and the southern racists used communism as a stick with 
to beat the civil rights movement all through the and and and i wrote that out in terms of 
story an fdr story set in oxford in the and full of real people along with my protagonist protagonist 
are of course not real and since then i have been writing other novels written a third novel about 
young scottish a member of parliament a woman too young even to vote for herself when she was actually 
real history elected to the british parliament in and now writing a fourth one but still doing philosophy at 
same time because these two genres address very different audiences and very different agendas ar narrative is for pleasure 
if you want knowledge you have to either do science or help others understand science and what my nonfiction 
including this one how history gets things wrong is about and i suspect that i was wise to pick 
as my stalking horse instead of a lot of other interpretive disciplines that also employ the theory of mind 
everybody who reads history thinks they acquire knowledge in history and will be affronted and offended by the claim 
they and so will maybe take on this book and try to refute it sc and what do what 
your philosophical colleagues think about the fact that you write novels ar many of them or at least my 
colleagues are extremely encouraging some of them read the novels in draft and make wonderful suggestions for improvements how 
i put it the one really wonderful philosopher and writer at the same time who has encouraged me to 
this is rebecca goldstein sc sure ar and by and large the other philosophers i know the word they 
to not notice my indiscretions sc good good for them very discreet about those things and alright one last 
thing i would love it if you share with the audience the wonderful anecdote about the cover photograph on 
girl from krakow ar the girl from krakow oh laughter i thought you were gonna ask about the cover 
on how history gets things wrong which is by far the best and most entertaining funniest cover ever seen 
an academic book ar if a stamp collector know about the inverted jenny the postage stamp in which in 
middle a biplane is printed upside down and which soon became the most valuable american postage stamp ever made 
accident and similarly this new book has famous napoleon crossing the saintbernard pass into italy upside down to show 
history got things wrong and i the word is printed upside down on the spine but an obvious and 
joke the inside joke for the girl from krakow is that we started out with a young woman sitting 
a german secondclass railway carriage with the with a swastika and clearly in the window and the words meaning 
the window and there she sits in the carriage smoking a cigarette and it was a perfect cover for 
book because of course everybody smokes in a book set in world war ii and so the design went 
all of its stages and finally it was sent to amazon for the amazoncom page and immediately we were 
that though they were perfectly happy to print a book about the holocaust in which millions of people were 
under the most atrocious circumstances possible by murderous genocidal maniacs even though they were perfectly happy to publish such 
book it was absolutely verboten to have a cigarette shown on the cover of any work that was gonna 
advertised on their website sc there you go rauchen verboten ar the story ar rauchen verboten sc this is 
real photograph right you stage it it was a historical photograph is that right ar yes and it came 
getty images and if you now go to the website and look at the cover see no cigarette there 
the cigarette was effaced by photoshop and she was given a fur collar and a silly hat as well 
so very happy with the book not nearly as happy with the photograph as with the original one sc 
is what we authors have to put up with some time ar right exactly sc alright alex rosenberg thanks 
much for being on the podcast ar sean a pleasure to be asked questions by you and i would 
someday to return the favor you are as good as terry gross sc alright make sure terry knows that 
thanks so much alex ar byebye music what an excellent conversation glad sean had the patience and wherewithal to 
both his own and thoughts on free will personally with alex and i would say to sean the difference 
tables and chairs on the one hand and free will on the other is tables and chairs will never 
anything more to us than tables and chairs whereas free will or rather determinism as a facet of consciousness 
to be spoken of always in terms of base reality and in this way with each generation we will 
to know more about consciousness much like how it was necessary for einstein to do away with newtonian conceptualizations 
gravity it is only by insisting on hard determinism in everyday language that we will come to know more 
ourselves thank you sean and alex for an edifying discussion enjoyed the podcast its transcript actually first on your 
when it comes to free will you started to hash it out with alex but then cut it off 
suggesting that it continue cutting it off made sense with the limitations of the format but the question is 
i would really like to see worked out i like your table and chairs analogy but for it to 
we also have to accept multiple simultaneous definitions of truth as alex points out while i expect right there 
multiple kinds of truth it is painfully close to the relativism which most of us would like to avoid 
guess is that the kind of relativism that allows tables and chairs to coexist with fundamental physics has some 
basis that if we worked it out would not be fuzzy at all whereas the postmodernist truths will always 
fuzzy though not entirely wrong it is a bit like how incompleteness says something very definite not fuzzy in 
domain but is routinely and wrongly applied to systems that are quite far from its domain i think the 
sean misses about free will is that there is a folk psychology and a folk morality that follows pretty 
that is incorrect do make decisions but ultimately there is no coherent decision maker inside our heads ultimately the 
has no separate existence independent of the various factors that give rise to it moment to moment as one 
teacher i forget who put it not that not real just that your not really real you interesting to 
toread this yesterday and then the article below this morning artificial intelligence hits the barrier of meaning machine learning 
yet understand things the way humans do with sometimes disastrous consequences by melanie mitchell ms mitchell is professor of 
science at portland state university nov two thousand eighteen new york times opinions thesis here parallels chinese room both 
how the brain might work they look inside and fail to see anything resembling the external world and from 
they surmise that it model the external world i think we have to resist thinkers like these they give 
too easily we know how a billion neurons collectively implement the mind but we still know that it does 
our lack of knowledge about all the processes inside neurons and other brain cells it be surprising we know 
the brain works as for what rosenberg is saying about history i really get it he seems to be 
that if we know how brains work then doing history by imagining what people like hitler were thinking is 
waste of time i think we ever know what hitler really thought so historians should use whatever works and 
we should be skeptical about guesses as to what hitler was thinking thank you so much sean for this 
to a philosopher and novelist i had never even heard of because no stop sign module has been found 
the brain we actually know what a stop sign means but we do theory of mind is useless for 
history but not for understanding simpler things or is it useless for understanding anything is it wrong to think 
a child avoids dogs because she was once bitten by one maybe philosophers are hesitant to agree to interviews 
they tend to get negative feedback on their ideas i think alex probably cares a great deal about what 
goes on inside a brain just not in a way we are used to thinking about it the thing 
he says that the most important aspects to understand decision or any decision for that matter are the strategic 
of a nation in a given moment ie external things from this it could follow that only external stuff 
necessary to predict behaviour this sounds rather like behaviourism and that the mind is a black box is there 
way to reconcile an interest with what goes on in the brain and this claim say that we all 
the concept of free will as a societal agreement based on the arguments used for this concept on could 
not be equally asserted that by the same rights that god an omniscient being exists excellent and thoughtprovoking episode 
always i am not trained in philosophy at all just very interested in these ideas what love to ask 
if i take everything that alex says and agree with it which logically and scientifically i find possible then 
is my motivation in living my life if i accept that free will is merely a useful social construct 
nothing exists except for subatomic particles can i simply cruise through the rest of my days and drift as 
particles seem to take me does he do that guessing not i realise these are probably old questions but 
be interested to hear any useful answers also it does occur to me that as a species we have 
to actually manipulate these subatomic particles to smash them into each other and to bounce them off mirrors with 
not sure that actually says anything meaningful but those particles would not by themselves have behaved in that we 
to wonder what a world would look like where children are taught the evolutionary basis of the brain how 
makes decisions how to develop metacognitive awareness of mind how to forge behavior based on this understanding and to 
this awareness within a culture of ethical expectation that people should be responsible for developing their lifelong there is 
self as naively conceived hence the quotes but another matter if we expect people to be responsible in driving 
car surely we must expect with greater insistence that people learn to drive their own minds this expectation could 
be manifest in culture even at the level of cartoons there will always be people like me who come 
understand there is no free will in doing so that gives us greater cognitive possibility because we can pay 
to manipulate and mitigate the effects of cognitive mechanisms resulting in decisions that otherwise manifest had we just let 
brain just what going to while justifying this limited state of affairs as making a choice manifesting free will 
are many problems with free will that i never hear discussed for example those who believe in myths about 
brain functioning can be manipulated by those with technological means imagine how advanced ai could manipulate a population that 
in free will no way a machine could manipulate they might believe more power to those controlling the machines 
that case belief in free will prevents particular neurological immunities belief in free will also undermines motivation to understand 
the brain actually works thus denying people toolkits that would allow them more possibilities for cognitive change there are 
such problems i claim that free will is one of the most dangerous delusions this species harbors but there 
no space here for that argument i think researchers like the late great dr ma persinger add a new 
to this argument with its implications of shared consciousness through emfs and those implications should provide the content for 
like alex to make claims like he does i think someone from dr camp no one public or well 
readily comes to would make an excellent guest sean great discussion keep up the excellent content this is quickly 
my favorite podcast enjoyed the show but thesis was articulate absurdity this pure dogmatic materialism is admirable but useless 
sic why philosophers are reluctant to explain themselves to the and the of consciousness is at the heart of 
discussions of free will external signals thoughts to look for a physiological location in the brain for a signifier 
sign etc is the wrong approach and an act of futility consciousnessmind is a process not a thing example 
is equivalent to we can point to dying leaves cooler temps bird migrations and so but we fall everything 
a metaphor a culmination of individual things processes causes and effects and i still have no idea what he 
to say regarding the veracity of history hi it would help if you had a bibliography of the books 
papers discussed in the podcast or at least things that the would be interesting for the listener if they 
to look into the topic further great conversation and to be taken into account for the impacts of what 
said i have to read the book but due to our still short knowledge of working structure to generate 
let call it that way conclusions he extracts need more studies true philosophy of knowledge which have been a 
of big attention by philosophers shall take into account the present situation of science in neurology psychology etc etc 
anyway what the dynamics creates as heuristics solution or other have real impact in society and in the external 
so these outputs require to be studied as such a reality independently of their causes or origins or the 
given to them either desires wishes beliefs it is no so important some how we need words for communication 
according to second wittgenstein language does its work and although partial incoherence lack of logic and other problems it 
communications and interchanging reactions to external world the key matter is that somehow not yet known the evolution of 
brain let survive the humans in front of an external world so the outside reality is getting the reaction 
the brain calling it representation or assuming the aboutness in the language is another matter musical or poetic languages 
able to open new visions of reality able to be communicated and able to produce real effects in the 
world might we deny reality to something that cause effects or not using the word cause that change the 
reality either social or material or in other minds absolutely loved this thank you i have a question about 
i can call the i mean the rationality of the writtenspoken language is this language rationality different from the 
in the brain which originate the language or may i say that both rationals are identical and there are 
two different matters i mean language is just the internal logic and not a translation from thoughts to language 
the semiotic triangle theory saysi hope the neurology science will clarify it perhaps a psychoanalysis approach may clarify this 
well can anybody express his discursive thoughts without words yes you can have a diffuse thinking of many types 
in order to develop and get a define idea or defined thought you must use words in your mind 
or as same time of speaking or writing if science is able to put light into this it will 
a great help for philosophy can any body can give me studies or references about this thanks as i 
to the podcast i was struck with how closely alex view of history parallels criticism of how history was 
in his own time he wrote extensive on the subject in and very eager to read history gets things 
i have been wrestling with these concepts myself and just not getting anywhere so thanks to alex for elucidating 
eloquently i fail to see how anyone who has ever played or listened to jazz can say that there 
no such thing as free will or any music for that matter the notes on the page are barely 
of the interpretation that a talented musician brings to the performance i also think there is anything deterministic in 
performance where there is only one possible way for a musician to play a piece regardless of their freely
