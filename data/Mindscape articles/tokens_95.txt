annual feynman teaching prize download episode click to show episode transcript sean carroll hello everyone and welcome to the 
podcast your host sean carroll you may have heard the one sign of an open rationally minded thinker is 
ability to change mind to have an opinion and change it to something else in the fact of new 
or evidence personally i even remember usually when i change my mind about things one of the ways my 
works and i think unusual in this is that i convince myself that i always believed that thing i 
right now even though i did change my mind but one example where i remember very vividly in science 
i changed my mind from a strong belief one way to another and in whether or not pluto is 
planet you may have heard you may remember where you were when you first learned the news back in 
international astronomical union got together and decided that we would no longer classify pluto as a planet but instead 
a dwarf planet this caused outrage across the globe as people school children and older folks said we know 
the planets are there are nine of them and pluto is one of they said even made it into 
episode of rick and morty the animated feature but there on rick and morty the reason why pluto had 
demoted is because it was getting smaller that the plutonians were mining their own central core so that pluto 
was shrinking over time not why in the real world pluto got demoted not that pluto changed that our 
of the solar system changed pluto get smaller the rest of the solar system got bigger sean carroll out 
beyond the orbit of neptune something called the kuiper belt which is a collection of a large number of 
many many many objects some of them get pretty big only fairly recently that we discovered that there are 
number of objects in the kuiper belt that are comparable in size to pluto so basically the choice for 
was either to expand the solar system to include all of these new discoveries as new planets or to 
pluto from the ranks of course another option which is the one that i originally believed which is you 
just grandfather pluto in right you could say the planets are the nine planets that we know about and 
discovered in is the last one gonna let into the club sean carroll known for a long time that 
is small pluto is smaller than moon but the important thing upon reflection is that pluto is not even 
most important object in its orbit around the sun orbit crosses that of neptune at an angle sort of 
that important dynamically speaking in the solar system so rationally there is really no reason to keep pluto as 
planet and exclude the other ones sean carroll the iau the international astronomical union eventually decided to just invent 
new category call them all dwarf planets if anyone is responsible for this change in attitude towards the status 
pluto today guest dr michael brown an astronomer and colleague of mine at caltech mike was the one who 
the team that discovered these other large kuiper belt objects that are now joining pluto in the dwarf planet 
received a lot of scorn for being the person who demoted pluto but he owns it rather than denies 
twitter handle is plutokiller and his book is called how i killed pluto and why it had it coming 
the book that i read that finally changed my mind as a scientist important to be rational to try 
understand things to categorize them properly and when you face up to the evidence pluto does not belong in 
planet club sean carroll these days mike is trying to make up for what he did to the solar 
by finding a new planet he and our colleague konstantine batygin at caltech claim that there is evidence in 
motion of known kuiper belt objects for a new planet out there far beyond the orbit of neptune which 
have dubbed planet nine just to remind us that pluto is not one of the planets we already have 
can make up your own mind the astronomers have made up theirs today gonna figure out why we think 
pluto belong and what that tells us about the future of understanding going on in our solar system so 
mike brown welcome to the mindscape podcast mike brown thanks for having me sean carroll so technically an astronomer 
in a planetary sciences department here at caltech what do you tell people you are when you meet them 
an airplane mike brown so i will say if someone says do you i say an astronomer but my 
title is professor of planetary astronomy so i get to kind of have it both ways an astronomer who 
at planets in our solar system sean carroll yeah you look at stars or galaxies like a real astronomer 
brown you know they get in the way and i have to somehow figure out ways to ignore them 
i look at the real planets sean carroll how did you get interested in that what was what captured 
imagination mike brown it is not what i thought i was gonna do when i went into graduate school 
be an astronomer i went to berkeley for graduate school and i went to berkeley because i wanted to 
on the most distant galaxies known to man and sean carroll made a terrible mistake mike brown yeah so 
most distant galaxies at the time were the goal was to find things at a redshift of three which 
funny to people who know these days that people are finding things i even know how much further away 
days but at the time that was the big quest find things at redshift of three one of the 
doing this the best in the world was hy spinrad at berkeley and so i went to berkeley to 
with hy spinrad hy spinrad had a hobby of looking at comets in addition to looking at galaxies and 
just liked not sure why actually his wife claims that the reason he liked to look at comets is 
he tell the difference between galaxies and comets because they look the same sean carroll they look the same 
back in the day we even know right nebulae mike brown yeah back in the day it that long 
so we did actually but he would take spectre of comets study the composition of comets and he always 
to get his grad students interested in studying comets in addition to galaxies and he could never get anybody 
because at the time and still sort of this way at the time in astronomy a rank order of 
is the coolest and who is the least cool and the coolest kids are the ones who study the 
most distant things so what i wanted to do so if you study very distant galaxies super cool if 
study nearby galaxies probably okay if you study stars in our galaxies kind of a loser and if you 
planets or anything in our solar system like why are you even there sean carroll right like exoplanets are 
but planets that are in actual our solar system mike brown so at the time there were no known 
so even the fact that exoplanets have now made nearby things because exoplanets are closer than distant galaxies so 
the ranking is a little different but at the time if you studied planets a loser he forced his 
to study comets for one summer before they could look at galaxies cause he just wanted them to get 
work done for him sean carroll hazing ritual mike brown yeah so i did mostly i wanted to work 
comets but i worked i mean galaxies but i worked on this comet stuff and a moderately bright comet 
by at the time and we went up to the telescope leuc observatory to study it and i remember 
moment forever we were looking at comet austin i remember what year comet austin was we were looking at 
austin through the telescope getting a spectrum coming out seeing the composition and i walk out into the dome 
the telescope and i can sight up the barrel of the telescope and i see the comet sean carroll 
your eyes mike brown there in the sky and that was it i was like my god this is 
an abstract thing like a distant galaxy with coordinates that measuring this is that thing in the and i 
stuck since then i have always sean carroll your heart beat a little faster mike brown it really did 
my thesis my phd thesis i studied jupiter and its moons and i would be there with the telescope 
i would get out my binoculars and stand outside and look at the moons and see the same thing 
was seeing and it was just i love that visceral feeling that what studying is actually real as opposed 
this very distant smudge sean carroll those are also real by the way just so our listeners know mike 
not convinced sean carroll but they are less visceral they are further away mike brown you so you see 
almost everything studied these days i study some pretty faint things but at the time they were all bright 
that you could take out your binoculars and see them and that was pretty cool sean carroll and you 
spectra one of the things i was an undergraduate astronomy major i know if you knew that i have 
degrees in physics my phd and degree are both in astronomy mike brown all right sean carroll forgotten it 
by now but one of the things that absolutely was drilled into me was the ability of astronomers to 
an incredibly tiny amount of data and spin an incredibly elaborate story about what they were looking at so 
you say a little bit about we take a picture of a comet what does that tell us how 
we get information about it mike brown yeah so for the studies that we were doing in particular the 
you take a the up in the sky you collect the light from the comet you stick it into 
big elaborate prism and you split it up into all its colors and all of the chemicals in the 
in the atmosphere of the comet in that coma that makes a comet a comet each one of them 
a different fingerprint of basically colors that it emits and so we were simply trying to see what all 
chemicals were in that coma by looking at the very we had a very very very fine spectrograph called 
prism where we could really break up the light into an incredible number of colors and we could really 
very detail see not just what the chemicals were but they slightly change their characteristics based on their temperatures 
their velocities and so we could map out all these things just by looking at that one little spot 
light sean carroll because these comets are moving around the sun and catching them not when at their furthest 
but when more of less close to the sun and moving by mike brown because we needed it to 
pretty bright to be able to break up the light into all those components so the comets that people 
to study in detail are ones that are pretty much the same distance away from the sun as the 
is when they really start to get they heat up their surfaces evaporate they get all that stuff in 
atmosphere and when you can really study their details sean carroll and dirty snowballs roughly speaking what i remember 
my astronomy classes mike brown dirty snowballs and then the interesting question is what is the dirt and what 
the snow sean carroll right mike brown cause yes mostly water in the snow and mostly we know what 
on the dirty part but that studying the other parts of the comet are really been sean carroll and 
really snow there was never a snowfall on the comet ice mike brown ice sean carroll yeah an ice 
so you moved on though from comets to mike brown i did sean carroll planetlike things mike brown well 
then as my phd i studied the volcanic emissions from moon io as they exploded off the surface of 
and then they would go into orbit around jupiter and then the magnetic field of jupiter would grab a 
of them and start spinning it around and so i was studying this elaborate dance of all these objects 
you could do and the same thing actually the same instrument that broke up the light into very small 
that allowed me to see this and that and where going and that it was fantastic sean carroll looking 
all the chemicals that io i always said eo is it really io mike brown i can say both 
the same sentence sean carroll a professional okay so yeah so the volcano this huge volcano right on io 
brown there are a bunch of them sean carroll a bunch of them spewing stuff out int to the 
the whole neighborhood of jupiter is like a mess with magnetic fields and radiation and a whole bunch of 
mike brown and junk from io actually junk from io is one of the main components of the magnetosphere 
on there sean carroll which would make it tough to go visit jupiter and hang around in a spaceship 
brown this is actually why when spacecraft go to jupiter they usually spend most of their time pretty far 
and in fact the juno spacecraft there right now on this very very very elongated orbit it comes in 
close but then it goes off super far away and it does that because it cannot spend that much 
very close because get smacked basically by stuff that came from volcanoes at io sean carroll huh okay so 
though studying things that we know to have existed so galileo discovered io mike brown yes yes sean carroll 
was a long time ago mike brown that is true sean carroll what made you move on to the 
reaches of the solar system mike brown so while i was a graduate student at berkeley the very first 
beyond neptune since pluto was discovered first new kuiper belt objects one thousand nine hundred ninetytwo is its license 
number and at the time i remember hearing abut it at the time from the discoverer actually the day 
it went public jane luu told me about it she was in an office right down the hall from 
and i thought interesting but who sean carroll just a rock mike brown yeah an ice ball big deal 
very quickly it became apparent that this region beyond neptune was full of stuff and that it was in 
sense the most pristine region of the solar system not pristine but the most pristine like these things are 
been in deep freeze since the beginning of the solar system and you can study more and more about 
the solar system formed by finding these very distant things and so i thought is an interesting thing to 
mike brown but the big change was when i arrived at caltech and looking around at caltech as an 
at caltech i suddenly had access to telescopes that i had never had access to before the big telescope 
palomar observatory the relatively new at the time keck telescopes out on mauna kea are big telescopes that are 
good at seeing faint objects i made a deliberate decision to stop studying these relatively bright planetary objects because 
had unique ability to study these faint ones and i sort of changed path entirely and decided to start 
the outer parts of the solar system sean carroll so set the stage here what the solar system looks 
i mean you have your planets you have your asteroids you mentioned the word kuiper belt what is the 
of all these things and where does the planetary system end and stuff like that mike brown the inner 
of the solar system most people would say the inner part of the solar system is everything inside the 
of jupiter so got mercury venus and earth and mars all in a line there and then between mars 
jupiter is this big region of relatively small rocky asteroids the asteroid belt and the asteroid belt is not 
star wars version where you have to dodge while flying through it every time a spacecraft goes to the 
solar system they try desperately to fly near an asteroid so they can take a picture of an asteroid 
hard hard to find them unless you try really hard sean carroll not what the movies have taught me 
brown no nothing quite like that sean carroll very dangerous place as far as mike brown yes you could 
through there a million times and miss every asteroid unless you were trying hard sean carroll when i was 
kid i was absolutely convinced that it used to be a planet that got destroyed somehow and i still 
of cling to that belief apparently astronomers believe that the asteroid belt used to be a planet mike brown 
but they did believe that at first so the first asteroid was discovered january it was ceres and then 
quick succession three more were discovered imagine how strange this was there were you could look up in the 
the most recent discovery had been uranus and uranus was the first thing discovered with a telescope the first 
that we knew about in the sky that we know about before found with the telescope and kind of 
minds sean carroll well sorry galileo and the moons right mike brown yeah okay so there were moons and 
that were being found actually moons herschel discovered them i think of the year that herschel discovered them but 
right sean carroll uranus is out there all by itself mike brown all by itself and so it actually 
people to search for a new planet systematically and at the time there was this sort of numerology the 
that suggested there should be a planet right about where it turns out the asteroid belt is because easy 
make up numbers that make you think something might be true mike brown and so people started looking they 
themselves the celestial police and they started scanning the skies actually the celestial police did not find the first 
there was an accidental discovery from the first one but the celestial police found many of the next three 
they found four in quick succession four maybe four years three years four years and they all had very 
orbits so people were looking for a planet at about this location and they find four small things and 
was the not unreasonable at the time assumption like it must have been a planet that seems plausible sean 
or it was exploded mike brown yeah something happened sean carroll it was blown up yeah mike brown and 
else was found until i actually know when the fifth asteroid was found but it was i think it 
sean carroll how many do we know about now mike brown oh maybe down to the size of a 
or something tiny things out there that are found and now we know that there was no planet that 
there in fact the opposite that a planet would have formed there but jupiter messed with everything whenever anything 
on in the inner solar system probably fault sean carroll right exactly but i think that a lesson that 
back to you i think we think of the solar system as big the planets are relatively tiny and 
sort of treat them independently i think in the mind of a non astronomer mike brown yeah sean carroll 
the lessons are over these millions and billions of year time scales a lot of influence on going on 
different parts of the solar system from the planets that are there and this fact that a whole bunch 
things in more or less similar orbits between mars and jupiter has to do with gravity and dynamics and 
jupiter does things mike brown yeah if it been for jupiter all these objects would have been able to 
together to form a planet but instead jupiter is so close by every time an object gets close but 
even really that close to jupiter it gets a little tug and its orbit is kind of perturbed and 
up so basically as these things are trying to coagulate jupiter comes by and shakes them they try to 
jupiter shakes them in the end never able to form a planet sean carroll or the jovians want the 
so they destroyed the planet in its early days mike brown that is actually possible sean carroll jupiter be 
close minded the establishment is hiding some things here read them so good mike brown so the inner solar 
sean carroll the inner solar system and then we get to jupiter mike brown so jupiter so then the 
of the giant planets so jupiter and saturn are the two really big giant planets funny people have a 
poor understanding of the sizes of planets because mostly they see them on lunch boxes where all more or 
the same size sean carroll and pretty close together mike brown a little smaller than jupiter but not that 
smaller so jupiter and saturn are huge sean carroll whopping big planets mike brown and so these are the 
we measure everything in is astronomical units one being the distance from the earth to the sun is one 
unit at five so five times further from the sun and then the giant planets are nicely arranged a 
a uranus is at be nice if neptune were at but no at close enough so those are pretty 
to remember so neptune is the end of this realm of the giant planets but uranus and neptune are 
not nearly as large as jupiter and saturn are they are i think uranus and neptune are maybe three 
four times the physical size of the earth big but not sean carroll i think that they were that 
mike brown yeah really kind of small jupiter saturn huge jupiter is three hundred fifteen i think is the 
times more massive than the earth neptune is about seventeen times more massive than the earth sean carroll and 
gas giants does that mean all gas or little rocky cores right mike brown so the big ones well 
this is actually one of the prime reasons that the juno spacecraft is at jupiter right now in orbit 
jupiter is trying to answer that exact question we think probably that they all have rocky cores but we 
for sure and trying to find the answer to that with these sorts of spacecraft sean carroll i mean 
great red spot has been on jupiter for hundreds of years it do people think that maybe the reflection 
that some feature on the surface of the core mike brown no sean carroll or purely atmosphere mike brown 
purely atmosphere the core is tiny the core so i said that jupiter weighs about three hundred fifteen times 
than earth the core might be fifteen earth masses of that so really a very tiny fraction a critical 
that actually leads to the formation of jupiter itself but in terms of going on with jupiter actually a 
insignificant chunk going on so jupiter and saturn is very much like a slightly smaller version of jupiter mike 
uranus and neptune are very very different although we think of them all as gas giants many astronomers call 
and neptune ice giants so a better description of uranus and neptune let me step back a good description 
jupiter and saturn is mostly gas with a little bit of core uranus and neptune are mostly core with 
little bit of gas not like you can stand on their surface and not like they have a solid 
in the core this weird metastable liquid that i understand the physics of but i really even understand what 
means when i say it some people say that liquid on the interior not really liquid int eh interior 
very different from jupiter and saturn sean carroll never landed on any of these planets mike brown well sent 
into a probe into jupiter it scratched the tiniest bit of the surface before it was imploded due to 
pressure of the sean carroll the metaphorical surface it actually reach the core mike brown yeah it went in 
tiny tiny bit people would love to send probes into the other ones in particular uranus and neptune would 
fascinating because so different and we know so little about them and because planets like those seem to be 
common throughout the galaxy and so it would be very interesting to learn about what those planets are more 
so uranus and neptune have been flown by once by voyager one or two i forget which one went 
of them diverted so it could do a fly by of the rings of saturn and to do that 
had to basically go up out of the solar system and never go by anymore but one of them 
by uranus and neptune it we know very little about these planets sean carroll which means a lot of 
for young astronomers to grow up and study these more mike brown yeah find out sean carroll a lot 
we know right okay and it was always true about pluto that it was a little weird if you 
a picture of the solar system that was a little bit more accurate the orbit was way more eccentric 
like all these planets have circular orbits a very strong ellipse tilted compared to everything else and not even 
own orbit it crosses inside neptune occasionally mike brown yeah a weird i remember before we understood place in 
rest of the solar system it really was just considered sort of this oddball at the edge of the 
system no one really knew why it was there how it got there it really make any sense but 
was like i sean carroll it was found kind of by accident like they were kind of looking for 
mike brown yeah so well this is how the whole problem with pluto and planet hood started is that 
were looking for planet x now when you say planet x people just think that means anything out there 
you know about but planet x was an actual thing there was a prediction of a specific planet from 
lowell percival lowell had letters for all of his predictions and x just happened to be the one that 
was predicting and the reason he thought that there was planet out there is because he looked at the 
of uranus and neptune and they appeared to be being tugged by something mike brown and of course this 
how neptune itself was found and so the day that neptune was found in one thousand eight hundred fortyfive 
everywhere were like leverrier predicted a planet based on perturbations and dude got super famous gonna do the same 
sean carroll i can do that mike brown literally from that day people have been saying predict a planet 
predict a planet i predict a every single one of them has been wrong until very recently but lowell 
predicted that there was this planet and set out to find it and mike brown had predicted that there 
this planet and set out to find it and he actually one of the very first times he looked 
it he sent a team up to mount wilson right here above us here in pasadena you know you 
look out the window and see the telescopes the big telescopes exist yet this was something like there was 
small station up there he said look in this and they took a big photographic plate of the sky 
there and brought it back down and he looked at it and was like sean carroll a lot of 
mike brown i see this giant planet that looking mike brown so he eventually passed away but had founded 
observatory with one of the goals was to find his planet x that he predicted and why clyde tombaugh 
hired off the farm to come take pictures of the sky looking for this planet clyde tombaugh took a 
pictures and realized that he know what a planet looked like because he just it looks like a star 
carroll right a spot on your photographic plate mike brown percival lowell thought that it was going to be 
so he thought he would know what it looked like it would be a big spot instead of a 
one clyde tombaugh said and so he realized that you take a picture one night and then you take 
picture the next night and all the stars and all the galaxies are in the same place planets move 
brown so we did that we took photographic plates looked for things that moved and very quickly and very 
to the predicted location of planet x he found pluto sean carroll it was a little dot moving mike 
and you know this is i think about this a lot because this is one of the ways that 
can get it wrong at first and then eventually correct itself there was a prediction of a giant planet 
this location something was found at this location therefore it must be that thing so if you go to 
new york times headlines of the when they announced the discovery ninth planet discovered in the solar system blah 
blah and right below the headline new planet four billion miles from the sun i think the right number 
do miles well but four billion miles from the sun possibly as large as jupiter and meets predictions and 
meets predictions is where science can get itself in trouble mike brown so because it was a prediction people 
so people thought at first that pluto was as big as jupiter that is only wrong by a factor 
but it you know if you think as big as jupiter if it were as big as jupiter there 
be no question that a planet in its own right it took a long time for that mass of 
to slowly work its way down to the realization now that like a tiny fraction smaller than our moon 
a tiny fraction of the mass of the moon because just a little ice ball so in the grand 
of things in the solar system pretty small sean carroll and then this thing called the kuiper belt which 
a kind of interesting history of its own right it discovered by kuiper mike brown it was vaguely predicted 
kuiper sean carroll yeah mike brown so it was named after kuiper i think this is a long standing 
good tradition in astronomy that it was basically named by those people who found one thousand nine hundred ninetytwo 
was i would say the second kuiper belt object after pluto being the first but we know it at 
time and they said kuiper belt and they named it after kuiper because kuiper had written a paper that 
that possibly there is this belt of ice balls out beyond pluto they said at the time out beyond 
the source one of the sources of comets that come into the inner solar system mike brown the kuiper 
was really nearly a throwaway it was not a very detailed calculation or really much of a prediction but 
was you know kuiper is a large figure in planetary astronomy so actually very happy that it was named 
him there are people who argue that was the inappropriate name it should be called the blah blah blah 
but not should be the discoverers named it and i think i respect the naming of the discoverers sean 
absolutely and different than the oort cloud which heard about in terms of where comets come from also so 
do we need an oort cloud and a kuiper belt mike brown there are tow flavors of comet one 
of comet comes in basically in the disc of the solar system and we see a lot of comets 
are basically on the same types of orbits as all the planets are tilted by a little bit but 
very much and then we see a second set of comets that come from everywhere all directions equally with 
preference those come from the oort cloud and cloud because this uniform very distinct cloud around the sun and 
kuiper belt belt because a taurus of material out beyond neptune just like the asteroid belt is mostly stuff 
the plane of the solar system the kuiper belt is the same way sean carroll and are these really 
clearly distinct populations would they kind of blend into each other mike brown well so this is an active 
that we would like to know the answer to they probably come from the same original source but we 
very much about the transition from the kuiper belt to the oort cloud i used to think i did 
now i know less than i used to sean carroll science mike brown yeah true so the kuiper belt 
as continuing our tour of the solar system so neptune is the edge of the what we know of 
the realm of the giant planets and then out beyond neptune there is this belt of icy material that 
completely analogous to the asteroid belt not the same as the asteroid belt icy instead of rocky but the 
for it the way it behaves are exactly the same mike brown the reason there is a kuiper belt 
of a planet beyond neptune is because neptune messed with stuff neptune did the same thing to the kuiper 
that jupiter did to the asteroid belt there would have been a planet beyond neptune had neptune not formed 
and then shock up everything out there and let it form into a planet so no planet out there 
a belt of debris basically that never got a chance to form a planet sean carroll and some of 
moons and things of the planets we know about in the solar system might have been captured from the 
belt is that a reasonable hypothesis mike brown so the moons yeah the moons that you generally know of 
the big ones like the galilean satellites titan around saturn those all formed in place so those are all 
of the planetary system but all of the giant planets have called irregular satellites regular meaning that the regular 
are in the plane of the planet they rotate the same direction as the rotation of the planet so 
part of that initial disc but they all have you know it almost sounds like the oort cloud that 
was talking about they all have these clouds of small moons around them that are just going in all 
of crazy directions and those are absolutely captured from the kuiper belt or from the region where the kuiper 
got started to begin with so some of them they were probably captured early on before there was even 
kuiper belt but the same stuff those same icy things that are out there sean carroll yeah okay all 
good so i think that more or less finishes our tour able to catch up where jane luu i 
it was had discovered a new kuiper belt object mike brown this new yeah sean carroll now what year 
that mike brown why it gets that license plate number of one thousand nine hundred ninetytwo sean carroll okay 
that in a similar orbit to pluto or similar size mike brown about two hundred kilometers across so small 
to pluto which is about kilometers across and it does not have the same sort of orbit as pluto 
little further away further out a little bit more circular than pluto is what we now know is that 
are several different classes of objects in the kuiper belt there are many many many many objects with orbits 
like pluto and an orbit just like pluto i mean exactly the same orbit i mean it is it 
inside the orbit of neptune tilted by anywhere from zero to thirty degrees elongated like pluto is elongated if 
drew a diagram of all those objects and put orbit in there too you could not distinguish sean carroll 
mike brown so one flavor like that a little bit further out a flavor of ones that are like 
one thousand nine hundred ninetytwo a little bit more circular a little bit more they cross the orbit of 
to cross the orbit of neptune and to live you have to be on a very special orbit in 
residence called so pluto and all of these other objects that are called plutinos sean carroll plutinos mike brown 
that i think is a good name too mike brown all of those objects neptune they go around two 
the sun they go around the sun two times precisely for every three times neptune goes around the sun 
locked into this very precise dance that they are through complicated gravitational mechanism forced to be locked into that 
escape it but by being locked into that they never come close to neptune so every time they cross 
orbit of neptune neptune is on the other side sean carroll somewhere else mike brown of the sun so 
pluto comes closer to uranus than it ever does to neptune even though it crosses neptune sean carroll another 
of this sort of gentle but crucially important dynamical influence that the planets have on each other mike brown 
sean carroll and random objects in the solar system be in any old orbit certain orbits that are happy 
a planet to be in mike brown yeah sean carroll and good so but this is this discovery of 
kuiper belt objects this is somewhat your fault or in fault anyway for giving you telescopes mike brown yeah 
something so yeah so this is when i started here there were boy i probably when i started as 
young naïve assistant professor there might have been a hundred known kuiper belt objects sean carroll okay mike brown 
is a going from one in one thousand nine hundred ninetytwo to was a lot of work for a 
of people and i realize this is going to be big i want to get into this and so 
started doing a couple projects studying the known objects and what i really got excited about was the realization 
it was very clear it was obvious to people who had looked carefully at it that there would be 
large kuiper belt objects out there large i mean pluto size bigger than pluto size we know but that 
was not an outlier it just happened to be the one that was found first by clyde tombaugh but 
should be other things very much like sean carroll plutoesque mike brown like pluto the hard thing is that 
objects the small number of large objects is a lot harder to find than the large number of small 
the analogy i used to always make when i was doing this is that if you you know if 
go out into the ocean and you get a big net and you scoop it find a ton of 
fish but probably not going to get a whale sean carroll ah okay mike brown finding a whale is 
lot harder sean carroll i caught that analogy a good one mike brown you have to go sail all 
so we have a good way of we have a big net astronomers at the time were really good 
were just developing these electronic detectors the ccd that everybody now has in their cameras were pretty new then 
pretty small if you remember your first digital camera it might have been one of those like three hundred 
by five hundred pixels that was you know tiny compared to what we have now astronomers were the same 
we could only look at a tiny area of the sky but these things were so good you could 
carroll and this is late mike brown late so if you wanted to cover large swaths of the sky 
with these digital detectors so i actually i did one of the very last projects i think with photographic 
that i probably the youngest astronomer to ever do a project using photographic plates that might actually be a 
statement not sure true but i used this old telescope at palomar observatory which had been built at the 
time as the big two hundred inch telescope the fortyeight inch schmidt telescope had been built basically to take 
field pictures of the sky to help the two hundred inch know where to look sean carroll right mike 
what was interesting in the sky and there are these famous at the time these famous sky pictures that 
could go to any astronomical library and they would all have drawers that you would pull out and get 
palomar prints for that point in the sky and you could see what was in the sky now you 
get them all online and less fun but at the time if you were going to look at something 
would go to the library pull out the print you would take a picture of it you were about 
go to the telescope and need to make sure you were looking at the right thing they had these 
cameras designed specifically to you mounted it here and you could take a picture and walk back with your 
of where you were looking in the sky your finding chart we called them now you know kids these 
they just look on their computers sean carroll their internets and their twitters yeah mike brown yeah but it 
pretty fun back then mike brown so it was built to do that sort of thing and it was 
was doing things with photographic plates anymore so it was spending a lot of time just sitting around doing 
i like it when telescopes sit around and do nothing it makes me very upset sean carroll yeah mike 
so i realized that i could use it to take pictures of vast areas of the sky the disadvantage 
photographic plates are not very sensitive compared to digital detectors and so in a the difference is in about 
half an hour of exposing a photographic plate on the sky i can see things about the same faintness 
i can now from the same telescope still being used but with digital detectors in about thirty seconds sean 
okay mike brown so it was a painfully sean carroll this is why the last one to have done 
mike brown painfully inefficient but it means i could cover big areas of the sky so i spent a 
years doing that and and just sort of caught the bug i really was pretty convinced that we were 
to find something big sean carroll you were just papering the sky you were just looking all over the 
mike brown we have enough time to paper the whole sky and so we had to pick where to 
and so we did a swath right along the ecliptic the plane of the planets you know if we 
up in the sky and you see where the moon is and where mars is and where jupiter that 
this line across the sky the line across the sky that we looked at and we looked a little 
and a little below and went along there and spent three years it was pretty exciting we found not 
thing sean carroll pretty exciting mike brown zero literally zero there were no objects in the sky bright enough 
we could find them in that part of the survey that we did mike brown turns out had we 
i told you we looked at the ecliptic and we looked a little bit above and a little below 
we gone more below or more above we would have found things back in sean carroll okay mike brown 
we know that at the time it turns out the bright kuiper belt objects are preferentially above and below 
ecliptic not on the ecliptic who knew mike brown so we find anything but i just it just really 
to me that this is something that you just just needed to do somebody needs to go out there 
cover the whole sky photographic plates were a little bit of a pain but it this was right about 
time when the digital detectors were getting better and bigger they great but you could kind of string a 
of them together kind of like taking one hundred of those five hundred eighty by three hundred cameras and 
them all on a big board and pointing them at the sky i mean it was as sort of 
as that but in the end we could cover inefficiently still but we could cover vast parts of the 
and so it took about six more years seven more years to cover the whole sky but we covered 
whole sky much better than we could do with the photographic plates and slowly as we were covering the 
sky we would find we found a lot of moderately big kuiper belt objects say moderately big to me 
a five hundred kilometer object in the sky which is kind of cool sitting there looking and in your 
looking at the images from the night before and suddenly you see this thing a big chunk of ice 
no human has ever seen before sean carroll and literally billions of miles away mike brown pretty cool yeah 
fun sean carroll hanging out in the middle of nowhere mike brown i still get a charge every time 
find one of these new ones but every once in a while and actually more as we got further 
further off of the ecliptic be one that you would you know just looking through the data and be 
oh and you know i would do quick calculations of how big it was how far away what was 
on and it was pretty cool we find you know it started out we found one that was half 
size of pluto we thought that was pretty good sean carroll pretty good mike brown we know how big 
was at the time we thought maybe it was going to be bigger than pluto but we learned later 
was about half the size of pluto it was the biggest new thing that had been found at the 
it was the largest new object that had been found since i think it still is true largest object 
in the solar system since sean carroll okay well mike brown other than pluto sean carroll other than pluto 
okay mike brown i guess the largest oh when we found i used to say that phrase what was 
talking about i was talking about eris when we found eris which is later and not actually the largest 
i was wrong mike brown so at the time it was like the it was the largest object found 
pluto how that sean carroll pretty good mike brown that was good and then we found as time went 
find one that was slightly bigger like three quarters the size of pluto they just kept stacking up and 
by chance we found the smaller ones first and the bigger ones next and then one of the last 
we found was in fact eris eris was this one that i remember seeing it on my screen when 
first saw it and it was moving very slowly across the screen and it was really bright and my 
was did i do sean carroll all going to die mike brown did i do wrong this because you 
of your best discoveries are mistakes sean carroll oh yeah yeah yeah mike brown maybe maybe i mean i 
a lot of really exciting discoveries and most of them are wrong sean carroll had some really great theoretical 
too mike brown yeah so same thing so i was like did i moving slowly our typical sequence was 
would take an image every hour and a half we would take three images over the course of three 
and see how fast the things were moving so i thought if it just screwed up and i accidentally 
them every ten minutes and i see this thing not moving very much because actually an asteroid really close 
moving fast why bright what did i do i went and checked everything like that actually is right that 
right too oh right and i was like sean carroll real mike brown so i called up my wife 
i said just found a because it was obviously sean carroll back in those days mike brown as big 
pluto sean carroll yeah mike brown and a planet sean carroll right mike brown pretty clear that this thing 
a planet sean carroll eris mike brown eris sean carroll you name it that mike brown i did at 
time i did not name it that it we had code names for all the things that we found 
the time that we would talk about just we needed the first thing that it was called was the 
that the computer gave it which was oh i believe i even remember this one anyway some string of 
and numbers most of which used to mean a lot to me and now i remember it but we 
it code name xena which i had been reserving for sean carroll something mike brown something bigger than sean 
some warrior princess like thing mike brown something that was so you know with the idea being that people 
always talk about planet x i wanted an x i thought it would be nice to have an x 
wanted to have it a good mythological name and so okay so tv mythology sean carroll still mike brown 
pluto was named after a cartoon dog so that seemed okay to us not actually true but mostly true 
brown and then there were not enough female planet names and so i thought good if you wanted a 
x female name sean carroll choices are limited you picked a good one mike brown you do better you 
not do better it was an awesome we found a satellite there was an obvious name for this satellite 
was gabrielle so what we called it for the first the time while we were still studying it before 
were working on our papers to announce it to the world by the time it got announced it still 
a name so i told i believe i told one reporter that we called it xena and that story 
out and everybody now knows sean carroll the lead right there mike brown for many years it was mostly 
as xena or the other official license plate was two thousand three that was the international astronomical license plate 
sean carroll but clearly the stuffed shirts at the international astronomical union are not going to let you get 
with xena as a longterm name for an important celestial object mike brown yeah probably not sean carroll right 
brown although sean carroll so now eris mike brown so now eris which is i have to say a 
name sean carroll a good name mike brown so we get to name it they held off on allowing 
to name it until they could decide what it was sean carroll right mike brown there were some people 
were pushing very hard that it be called a planet when we announced it we said because i figured 
at the time i did not think pluto deserved to be a planet and so i actually believe that 
deserved to be a planet but i thought if you guys are going to call pluto a planet going 
call this a and the worst that could happen is you can say no not and then pluto get 
be a planet either so i you know winwin for me mike brown so we called it the planet 
were other people who were very adamant that it should be classified as a planet and other people were 
way and we just got to hand out and watch the arguments go but it meant that we name 
because if it was a planet well sean carroll different standards mike brown nobody knows how you name planet 
carroll yeah mike brown but if just a regular kuiper belt object ways to name it so sean carroll 
look when pluto was officially relabeled as a dwarf planet not a planet billions of hearts were broken mike 
yeah sean carroll people got very upset considered to be a bad person because of all this mike brown 
sean carroll and yet you kind of revel in that you back down you lean into it as they 
today mike brown yeah yeah sean carroll what is the best sales pitch for saying we call these things 
at least call pluto a planet why we just let pluto be a planet and call these other things 
objects or something like mike brown you will often hear arguments from astronomers who were tired of talking about 
that it matter is pluto no matter what you call it blah blah semantics it and i get what 
to say but i actually disagree completely with the statement that this is just semantics it matter not semantics 
word planet the word that you use is semantics but classification sean carroll right mike brown and classification is 
we do as scientists to try to understand phenomena in whatever field studying bad classification lead to a lack 
understanding of what going on you could be somebody who studies birds and you decide to classify them all 
you might classify them as you know sea birds and birds that live here and birds that borrow in 
ground and all these things and you know you would study them in different ways and be good or 
could be a scientist who studies birds and you could say going to study all the ones that have 
on their and you know a classification and a perfectly valid classification just not mean very much sean carroll 
on to anything real out there in the world mike brown it lead you to ask any important questions 
so when you look at the solar system and you think about a classification in the solar system the 
should lead you to the important questions so if you had the eight planets plus pluto as a planet 
main question you would ask about the solar system is the heck is pluto doing it you ask any 
about it because planet the word is the classification there is sort of meaningless mike brown there are other 
who suggested that you should have all round things should be planets which would include pluto and eris and 
hundred other objects in the kuiper belt sean carroll the moon mike brown the moon many moons so there 
many things and true they are different because the being round means you have enough gravity that you have 
yourself into a sphere which is very different and so the question you would ask yourself about the difference 
round things and not round things is why are there round things that seems like the obvious question well 
just told you gravity sean carroll yeah gravity mike brown we know the answer to that actually if instead 
classify the solar system and you were to say there are four terrestrial planets rocky planets mercury venus earth 
there are four giant planets or maybe two giant planets and two ice giants jupiter saturn uranus neptune between 
and jupiter between the terrestrials and the giant planets an asteroid belt beyond neptune a kuiper belt even further 
an oort cloud that leads to profound questions and the profound question the obvious question is why and that 
is the main question that we as planetary scientists are trying to answer how did the solar system get 
be the way that it is and by classifying it correctly you mike brown get to be the way 
it is by classifying it correctly you are led to that question by not we as scientists would still 
the right questions but i still feel like a public disservice to pretend that going to call all these 
things planets it help people understand what the solar system is like i would like people to understand what 
solar system is like sean carroll before we forget what is the definition of a planet mike brown not 
to say sean carroll nobody knows mike brown i refuse sean carroll better off that no one knows mike 
it is better off that no one knows because the definition there are people who are like a stupid 
yes it is a stupid definition the fact that there is a definition is stupid in astronomy can you 
of anything else a phenomenon in astronomy an object type in astronomy in the sky for which there is 
definition that somebody has to check sean carroll right mike brown in fact planet sean carroll they argue about 
mike brown planet has a three part definition that you have to fulfill all three parts the lawyers can 
about whether you fulfill sean carroll lay it on us tell us the three parts we need to know 
brown the iau says you have to be sean carroll round mike brown the last one you have to 
in orbit around the sun people get confused by this one too the definition of a planet in the 
system is that you have to be in orbit around the sun sean carroll i thought part of the 
for going through these arguments is because we thought we would be discovering planets elsewhere and we better have 
definition mike brown no the only motivation for this argument is to deal with pluto sean carroll okay mike 
literally there is no other reason for this definition of a planet than pluto had to be dealt with 
way or the other mike brown the definition is in orbit around the sun round big enough to be 
and then the third part kicker which is where all the arguments come about phrased terribly but i understand 
trying to say it has to clear its orbit sean carroll clear its orbit of other stuff mike brown 
other stuff sean carroll right mike brown instantly the amateur astronomical lawyers say neptune is not a planet because 
crosses sean carroll i was just going to say that yeah mike brown yes not because neptune is not 
planet because the definition is both poorly worded and a bad idea to have to begin with what trying 
say is that the planets are the gravitationally dominant things out there super easy to make a calculation of 
that you would call gravitation dominance and see that the eight planets are incredibly different from everything else in 
solar system they are big dominant bodies that kick around everybody else you could say the argument is the 
all the things that are not planets are sort of flitting in and out of the orbits of all 
planets getting kicked around by the planets and the planets are the ones doing the kicking nobody kicks planets 
a pretty good definition sean carroll by this definition we have the eight planets and pluto is just one 
the various dwarf planets in the kuiper belt as you sort of alluded to alternatively the only sensible alternative 
sort of just make pluto a thing all by itself would be to have dozens of planets mike brown 
actually sean carroll hundreds mike brown hundreds sean carroll be the discoverer of many many planets mike brown yeah 
is what i always find funny when people like just hate pluto so you want them to be a 
do you know that if i used your definition i would be the biggest planet discoverer in human history 
you know the answer is no they know sean carroll no they know that mike brown like just do 
to someone asked me back in that first year when xena was still being generally called the tenth planet 
was doing an interview and somebody said does it feel like to have discovered the tenth i stopped and 
thought about it i said know how it feels it feels sean carroll imposter syndrome mike brown no i 
say imposter syndrome say it actually feels fraudulent herschel opened up his brand new fancy telescope pointed to the 
and found uranus this thing seventeen times more massive than the earth a big chunk of the solar system 
verrier did calculations on how the orbits were going realized there was something else out there had someone point 
telescope and boom there was neptune those are significant things in our solar system if you removed any of 
our solar system would be a different place if you removed eris or pluto or any of these other 
the solar system is in exactly the same place they define the solar system in the same way mike 
it really did feel fraudulent to pretend that this was a major part of the solar system you really 
to pretend if you wanted to call it the tenth planet sean carroll the good news is now basically 
right we have the kuiper belt we have eight planets no more planets ever to be found in the 
system mike brown yeah not done sean carroll saying there could be other planets mike brown what saying there 
at least one other planet not saying could be sean carroll bold bold move mike brown not saying might 
i am as close to convinced as you can be in this business that we have found gravitational evidence 
a ninth planet if you recall i am about the person to say this since sean carroll a long 
lineage yes mike brown not distinguished it is really scary to say this it was scary for me and 
colleague who came up with this idea konstantin batygin he and i came up with this idea a couple 
ago we were very reluctant we started doing the calculations we started seeing what we were seeing and we 
like it really makes sense that a we do not want to be that person saying predict a planet 
right and everybody else is the interesting thing is that we predict a planet and right and everybody else 
wrong sean carroll just pause for a moment before getting to the evidence that right i want to just 
again or highlight this way that science works not only do we look for evidence and so forth but 
have prior beliefs part of those prior beliefs are colored by history and what has happened through history mike 
absolutely sean carroll rather than you and konstantin just running out and saying maybe a you say we all 
that this has been claimed before we should be extremely cautious and really make sure the are dotted and 
are mike brown we also knew that there were no other planets i was in graduate school when the 
nail was put in the coffin of planet x i should have mentioned this when we were talking about 
discovery of pluto and the perturbations and all this stuff is in the end the reason that percival lowell 
there was a planet x is because some of the earlier observations of planetary positions were not exactly right 
have the precise mass of uranus and neptune we have those until voyager flew by uranus and neptune at 
final neptune flyby we got the precise mass of neptune and redid all those calculations of where the planets 
where supposed to be there is no planet x sean carroll done with perturbations of planet x mike brown 
knew that in graduate school that paper came out we all knew there were no new planets to be 
and to think otherwise was sean carroll heresy mike brown yeah of course there are no new planets this 
when konstantin and i first started looking at these phenomena it was to prove that there a planet sean 
right what kind of phenomena do you look at mike brown one specific thing that we eventually found it 
us a while that if you look at the most distant objects in the kuiper belt most of the 
belt objects are in these kind of either kind of circularish orbits a little outside of neptune or maybe 
mildly elongated like pluto some of them actually are on hugely elongated orbits and go out ten twenty times 
than the orbit of neptune and then come back on these big ellipses like this if you look at 
ones that go the furthest we realized something unexpected which is the ones that go the furthest are preferentially 
up in a particular way the direction that going when they go out the furthest is a specific direction 
reason that should be so sean carroll where the aliens put them when they left their mike brown even 
the aliens sean carroll listening stations mike brown even if the aliens put them there they would very quickly 
themselves each of the objects in the whole solar system but in particular these distant ones their orbits change 
carroll be scrambled by the planet mike brown over time sean carroll basically mike brown they precess is what 
the direction of their orbits changes over a couple tens to hundreds of millions time period all these objects 
like hands on a clock that are moving at different speeds we happen to look up and all aligned 
could be you just happen to look up when all aligned or something else going on mike brown we 
of split in two my job was to decide whether or not it could be that they just happened 
be all aligned and it was coincidence konstantin started doing calculations to sean carroll math mike brown he started 
math he actually started out by writing equations on his board like what do you think about like sean 
looks good i like the greek letters mike brown those are my favorite so we really were trying to 
out what could have done this we knew a planet could do that you see that and like my 
must be a kind of the last one hundred fifty sean carroll because it would be similar to how 
trans neptunian objects are sort of certainly places they could fit in without being disturbed by neptune mike brown 
right sean carroll saying similar to that mike brown exactly right we know the details but we knew yeah 
get that there must be some gravitational perturbation that work we know that of course that works but a 
thing to jump to initially so figure out really going on because not a planet we tried really hard 
make it not be a planet nothing else there is no other way to make those objects line up 
way that they do sean carroll has the story gotten more convincing over time mike brown the convincing aspect 
it this has been two and a half years now our paper has been out sean carroll planet nine 
brown planet nine as we called it at the time sean carroll do you secretly in the back of 
mind have a name you want to give it mike brown no no i am suspicious suspicious also but 
but definitely suspicious too superstitious enough to feel like if you really start to think about a name you 
not find it sean carroll okay mike brown i honestly do not have a name which is pretty amazing 
have blocked that part of my brain so strongly sean carroll should we come up with a name mike 
no sean carroll should we invent something mike brown no no no no no sean carroll all right go 
mike brown planet nine we did have a nickname we have nicknames for everything the nickname was phatty at 
time sean carroll okay mike brown spelled with a ph it was because that was elsa when i had 
daughter she had a nickname before she was born i seem to make a habit of that we had 
picked out in case it was a boy it was going to be phatty an old family name of 
is jehosaphat there were many jehosaphat we always talked about naming our names jehosaphat but we would call him 
we would make sure that he was a jazz saxophonist because be phatty brown that sound it has a 
good name sean carroll yeah totally plays mike brown that was what we called planet nine at first eventually 
nine was such a good name that we just kept with planet nine two and a half years ago 
carroll it also is a little poke to people who think that pluto is still mike brown that was 
unintentional i promise mike brown two and a half years one of the things that always happens in astronomy 
in physics everything else is that theorists are really good at explaining anything sean carroll yeah sure mike brown 
if you sean carroll twelve different ways mike brown yeah if you said no sorry i mean that i 
found that like oh okay then i can explain that too theorists are good their job we knew that 
soon as we published both the observations that these things are lined up and our hypothesis of planet nine 
quickly there would be papers coming up with alternative explanations alterative physics we were curious what they were going 
be because we come up with any in two and a half years there are zero that baffles me 
no one has come up with another way to make that alignment sean carroll i mean dark matter cosmic 
aliens black holes i can come up with half a dozen mike brown yeah but write that paper sean 
okay mike brown it has to actually work sean carroll a higher level of you want it to work 
brown yeah no i always get the explanations of like if real physics really working seen no explanation mike 
the one potential explanation and the one part that we still worried about is the idea that it was 
a random coincidence and not only a random coincidence but a random coincidence can be helped along by some 
of bias in your observations there are many ways that these observations could have been biased you can imagine 
if saying that all of your objects are lined up in one particular way well what if the only 
you looked sean carroll exactly mike brown for example that would be an extreme version of the bias we 
about that it turns out to be very difficult to do that calculation right it has taken us in 
two and a half years to do that calculation right i just finished the paper on the final calculation 
morning literally sean carroll mazel tov mike brown the answer is the probability that just due to chance taking 
account all the biases of all the observations and everything else is a percent percent i think sean carroll 
mike brown it means possible sean carroll those things happen but not likely mike brown a small number sean 
yeah yeah mike brown what i say in the paper i say you have to believe in planet nine 
you but you have to believe in planet sean carroll you have to yeah mike brown the effect is 
if you believe in planet nine there needs to be another explanation for sean carroll why you go look 
it mike brown we are looking for it sean carroll okay mike brown the two and a half years 
bee both understanding those biases because understanding the biases is critical to then using the observations to predict where 
is as of right now now that i understand the biases i have a very tight prediction of the 
of planet nine in the sky sean carroll do you know where it should be mike brown i know 
path that its orbit traces out in the sky that is not the same as where it should be 
is where it should be except that i know where along the phat sean carroll when it should be 
mike brown yeah the bad news is not as good as le verrier le verrier said a planet right 
literally looked one night and found it it was right where le verrier said it was he got a 
lucky he had a couple things going for him one is he could make some assumptions like a circular 
in the plane of the solar system ours is definitely not a circular orbit and actually not in the 
of the solar system tilted by thirty degrees sean carroll okay does it perturb neptune mike brown it does 
perturb neptune so far out sean carroll circular orbit far away mike brown not a circular orbit an eccentric 
sean carroll sorry eccentric orbit mike brown its average distance away is about five hundred au remember neptune was 
nearly twenty times further away than neptune it has no effect on neptune or even the relatively nearby kuiper 
objects the only thing it affects are these very distant ones that go out into that realm they go 
into where it is and get affected by it sean carroll how big is planet nine supposed to be 
brown now we know right around seven times the mass of the earth it might be six it might 
five it might be eight but not that much different from that sean carroll okay mike brown seven times 
mass of the earth is again neptune is about smaller than neptune bigger than the earth probably like neptune 
that a mostly an ice giant mostly a liquidy core surrounded by gas sean carroll way bigger than the 
star for example mike brown it could swallow the death star quite easily sean carroll because you must be 
why is there such a thing out there why is it in the wrong orbit why is it so 
away mike brown we think we know the we have ideas the idea that an object out there is 
as to how it got there our evidence for its existence is solid then we just get to make 
stories on how it could have gotten there interestingly as soon we figured out that it was something like 
earth masses ten earth masses and on this eccentric orbit konstantin and i both the same light bulb went 
in our heads at the same time like oh i know where it came from yep me too the 
is ten earth masses is a special mass in the solar system ten earth masses is as talked about 
mass of the cores of the giant planets konstantin and i had actually written this paper six or seven 
eight years ago now about what would happen in the solar system if instead of four giant planets you 
out with five giant planets in the regular giant planet region the answer is nearly all the time one 
those giant planets gets destabilized gets a little too close to jupiter and gets tossed out mike brown we 
interested in how that affects the outer solar system and everything else we really once it got tossed out 
never worried about it again sean carroll the solar system is full in some sense planet wise mike brown 
wise yeah you stick new ones inside where the old ones are if you try they are most likely 
get ejected no reason why there should have only been four cores formed there should have actually been many 
cores formed probably there were cores being tossed out all the time we never really thought about what happens 
they get tossed out the idea that one gets tossed out and then gets still a little bit of 
waving of a magic wand that has to happen because it has to then get stabilized in the outer 
of the solar system and not come back in and not go back out we think that happens when 
sun is formed in a giant cluster of other stars we think we know how that our hypothesis is 
it happens sean carroll sure mike brown it all kind of makes sense it fits perfectly it mean true 
the idea that there was a core that got ejected and recaptured is so uncontroversial that when you suggest 
to theorists working on the solar system like yeah sean carroll yeah totally happened mike brown sure sean carroll 
out there does planet nine sometimes perturb kuiper belt objects and turn them into comets to come into mike 
absolutely it does something really interesting to them it does that by twisting their orbits instead of just perturbing 
and throwing them in it slowly perturbs them so things that used to be in more or less the 
plane as the solar system get their orbits twisted by about ninety degrees plunging into the solar systema and 
out again and then it drives them into the sun and past neptune mike brown the reason the transition 
konstantin and i took from thinking this was a cute theory that could explain things easy to come up 
theories that explain things but you believe them most of the time when we started believing it is when 
realized that we were predicting these orbits twisting and coming into the solar system we went out and realized 
those things exist and that nobody had an explanation for them they would be found and people would just 
is so weird i know why these things are coming our hypothesis now explains the alignment some of the 
detail dynamics these are other objects sean carroll fitting together yeah mike brown at that moment literally the moment 
did that i think both of just kind of look at each other like oh actually oh a oh 
planet out it went from cute idea to holy cow a planet go find it sean carroll optimistic about 
it by finding it we mean literally taking a picture mike brown yes in the end a hypothesis that 
am convinced is true no one else need believe it until we go see it sean carroll are people 
optimistic about it or are people scoffing mike brown some of each a whole group of people who are 
trying to find it because convinced we had a workshop here at cal tech in late spring of all 
people around the globe who are in search of it and exchanged ideas on where we thought it was 
who was searching and how they were finding it there are people who are like there are the general 
like i think most scientists should be probably not looked very hard at the evidence until you look at 
really carefully your default is always going to on really sean carroll it should be right mike brown right 
way to be then there are the no way impossible going to prove you wrong they try sean carroll 
knock yourself out mike brown yeah they succeeded yet sean carroll meanwhile flying to hawaii going up on top 
a mountain where big telescopes and taking snapshots and hoping to see a dot moving is that basically what 
mike brown yes i started in one thousand nine hundred seventyeight with photographic plates and now continuing it now 
for something even more distant and a lot fainter sean carroll do you really have to fly to hawaii 
have robots now mike brown it depends on the telescope actually the telescope that using the subaru telescope on 
of mauna kea the japanese national telescope they require you to be there they need to require you to 
there but they do sean carroll a philosophical dilemma of necessity and requirement that not quite qualified to adjudicate 
brown no actual reason for us to be there it would work just fine with us on video link 
else sometimes they actually do do that they do make us come up there which i mind at all 
spectacular place to go sean carroll when you see a moving dot how quickly will you know and with 
level of certainty that it actually is the planet been looking for mike brown i think that if we 
a moving dot in the subaru survey the things that you want to know are how fast is it 
because that tells you how far away it is and how bright it is because that tells you about 
big it is basically if we find anything that is five or six or seven hundred au away we 
things that far away unless planets basically sean carroll right okay mike brown if we see something moving at 
predicted speed we see it that night at the telescope we bring all the data home and have it 
through a computer basically be sitting in my office be looking through candidates and one will come up and 
consistent with everything i will be certain at that point sean carroll very quickly mike brown really sean carroll 
mike brown what do one is assume real and think about what doing about it but the other thing 
do is very quickly predict where it should be this will probably be a week or two later predict 
it should be that night based on what we did and we will find some astronomer somewhere in the 
at some telescope and say take a picture right here and tell me sean carroll take a picture not 
to tell you why but you know mike brown tell them it depends on who it is i have 
friends who would do it sean carroll right mike brown if where we predict then it is no questions 
is there we know it then the fun starts finding it is fun sean carroll yeah but learning mike 
actually studying it and learning about this new giant planet that we only have four we get a new 
pretty cool we have our day zero things that we want to do that start doing immediately sean carroll 
killed pluto for which we really forgive you but it will compensate somewhat if you find another replacement planet 
for you there mike brown this was all suggested by my daughter about four years ago she said do 
know how to get people to stop hating i was like gosh no i sean carroll nobody knows mike 
should i do sean carroll why is my four year old daughter thinking about these things mike brown she 
should go find a new planet and then people hate you mike brown i laughed and said ha but 
new now i realize sean carroll the delusion of age mike brown she knew what she was talking about 
carroll all right we are rooting for you mike brown thanks so much for coming on the podcast mike 
it was fun i really enjoyed this what would have made it even better is if brown spoke about 
relationship if any between planet nine and the oort cloud and what became of the heliopause that word mentioned 
nevertheless i really enjoyed this again with the highly unprofessional obsession that he planet pluto he did not as 
pluto still lives as a very geologically active world and the debate over planet definition and status remains ongoing 
active if the theorized giant planet exists in the outer system it is not the solar ninth planet and 
not be called numerous planetary scientists have requested that it be referred to by the usual term for a 
but undiscovered planet which is planet x could you please consider interviewing me or another person from the other 
of the planet definition debate for the sake of being fair and balanced i can recommend several people if 
want to interview someone other than me thank you in advance wow that was good sean i liked your 
intervention explanations or concerns i sure hope mike finds planet bob i have a book published in the by 
morrison about exploring the planets in it he states that there are ten planets including pluto and convidently excepted 
we will never find an one should i throw the book away was an interesting episode though i hope 
listen the comment a bit above this one and the other on in sake of the definition of a 
is only interesting to a point and are ultimately irrelevant it is nice that there were discovered many planetoids 
if there wasnt ignorance to oldest astronomical records what we have to detailed analysis of milagro cosmic rays survay 
planet nine and planet ten could be discovered pavel smutny i hope you listen to erik comment as he 
proposing to shut down debate without allowing the public to even hear the other side of this issue and 
it is of interest to many people and definitely relevant brown deliberately inserted the debate into the possibility of 
solar system planet by choosing the highly controversial term this latest article in the journal icarus discusses the relevance 
the issue and makes the case against the iau definition comments are closed sean carroll hosts conversations with the 
most interesting thinkers science society philosophy culture arts and ideas
