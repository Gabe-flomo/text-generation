cool thing about ecologists is that one question leads us to another to another if i were to be super general of course all about food resources and water resources the dry parts of the savanna where no fresh water going to avoid those areas no herbivores going to the watering
thing about ecologists is that one question leads us to another to another if i were to be super general of course all about food resources and water resources the dry parts of the savanna where no fresh water going to avoid those areas no herbivores going to the watering holes
about ecologists is that one question leads us to another to another if i were to be super general of course all about food resources and water resources the dry parts of the savanna where no fresh water going to avoid those areas no herbivores going to the watering holes and
ecologists is that one question leads us to another to another if i were to be super general of course all about food resources and water resources the dry parts of the savanna where no fresh water going to avoid those areas no herbivores going to the watering holes and so
is that one question leads us to another to another if i were to be super general of course all about food resources and water resources the dry parts of the savanna where no fresh water going to avoid those areas no herbivores going to the watering holes and so they
