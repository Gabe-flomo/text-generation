sean carroll hello everyone welcome to the mindscape podcast i am your host sean carroll and if youre like 
you remember maybe in high school maybe in college in some psychology course being taught about abraham maslows hierarchy 
needs there was this pyramid diagram and at the bottom of it there were your basic physiological needs food 
things like that then you built up through other higher level psychological needs until at the top you reach 
so todays guest scott barry kaufman is a psychologist who is proposing that we update maslows hierarchy of needs 
done two things thirtyseven sc number one hes actually dug into many of the writings that maslow himself did 
learned things like maslow himself never drew a pyramid and maslow himself had a lot of ideas that go 
beyond the famous hierarchy of needs and the second thing that scott does is propose an entirely new metaphor 
on a different kind of hierarchy he thinks that the pyramid metaphor is a little bit stationary and it 
you the idea that theres just something to achieve that would make us once and for all selfactualized one 
eight sc scotts idea is that instead what we should aim for is not selfactualization but transcendence and the 
he uses for this is not a pyramid but a sailboat theres the hull of the boat which has 
of your more basic needs and then theres the sails of the sailboat which have more dynamic needs and 
like this imagery because as a physicist as someone who knows about entropy and the arrow of time in 
big picture and elsewhere ive absolutely emphasized that we should think of life as a process as a series 
changes inevitable changes things like happiness which are very popular are a little bit overrated because we get the 
that you can just achieve happiness and stay there and life is not like that one hundred fiftyone sc 
and i talk about different ways of being psychologically healthy the different needs that hes identified the empirical research 
hes used to identify these needs and i push back a little bit because i dont agree with everything 
says but you know what thats psychology were not anywhere near done its not a mature field in the 
that particle physics or cosmology are that gives us a little bit of a way to think about ways 
we could do better in understanding who we as human beings really are how we can live our best 
two hundred nineteen sc i should also mention that scott has his own podcast called the psychology podcast he 
lucky enough to get that name early on where you can find him talking to a bunch of professional
