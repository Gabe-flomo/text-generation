      "Twenty-six people inside the school, including twenty children, were mas-\n",

      "ernor of Connecticut, Dannel Malloy, give his annual “State of the State” \n",
      "speech on television. He spoke in a strong and animated voice for the first \n",
      "three minutes, thanking individuals for their service. And then he began to \n",

      "\n",
      "We have all walked a very long and very dark road together. What befell \n",
      "Newtown is not something we thought possible in any of Connecticut’s \n",

      "sacrificed their lives protecting students.1\n",
      "\n",
      " As the governor spoke the last two words, “protecting students,” his voice \n",
      "caught in his throat ever so slightly. If you weren’t paying close attention, \n",
      "you might have missed it. But that tiny waver devastated me. My stomach \n",

      " Humanity has understood sadness and other emotions in this way for \n",
      "over two thousand years. But at the same time, if humanity has learned \n",
      "anything from centuries of scientific discovery, it’s that things aren’t always \n",
      "what they appear to be.\n",
      " The time-honored story of emotion goes something like this: We all have \n",
      "emotions built-in from birth. They are distinct, recognizable phenomena \n",
      "inside us. When something happens in the world, whether it’s a gunshot \n",
      "or a flirtatious glance, our emotions come on quickly and automatically, \n",
      "as if someone has flipped a switch. We broadcast emotions on our faces by \n",
      "way of smiles, frowns, scowls, and other characteristic expressions that any-\n",
      "one can easily recognize. Our voices reveal our emotions through laughter, \n",
      "shouts, and cries. Our body posture betrays our feelings with every gesture \n",
      "and slouch.\n",
      " Modern science has an account that fits this story, which I call the classi-\n",
      "cal view of emotion. According to this view, the waver in Governor Malloy’s \n",
      "voice launched a chain reaction that began in my brain. A particular set of \n",
      "neurons  —  call it the “sadness circuit”  —  leaped into action and caused my \n",
      "face and body to respond in a certain, specific way. My brow furrowed, I \n",
      "frowned, my shoulders stooped, and I cried. This proposed circuit also trig-\n",
      "gered physical changes inside my body, causing my heart rate and breathing \n",
      "to speed up, my sweat glands to activate, and my blood vessels to constrict.* \n",
      "This collection of movements on the inside and outside of my body are said \n",
      "to be like a “fingerprint” that uniquely identifies sadness, much like your \n",
      "own fingerprints uniquely identify you.\n",
      " The classical view of emotion holds that we have many such emotion cir-\n",
      "cuits in our brains, and each is said to cause a distinct set of changes, that \n",
      "is, a fingerprint. Perhaps an annoying coworker triggers your “anger neu-\n",
      "rons,” so your blood pressure rises; you scowl, yell, and feel the heat of fury. \n",
      "Or an alarming news story triggers your “fear neurons,” so your heart races; \n",

      "it seems reasonable to assume that each emotion has a defining underlying \n",
      "pattern in the brain and body.\n",
      " Our emotions, according to the classical view, are artifacts of evolu-\n",
      "tion, having long ago been advantageous for survival, and are now a fixed \n",
      "component of our biological nature. As such, they are universal: people of \n",
      "every age, in every culture, in every part of the world should experience \n",
      "sadness more or less as you do  —  and more or less as did our hominin an-\n",

      "blood flow won’t always change by the same amount. Your brow might fur-\n",
      "row slightly less by chance or by custom.2\n",
      "\n",
      " Emotions are thus thought to be a kind of brute reflex, very often at odds \n",
      "with our rationality. The primitive part of your brain wants you to tell your \n",
      "boss he’s an idiot, but your deliberative side knows that doing so would \n",
      "get you fired, so you restrain yourself. This kind of internal battle between \n",
      "emotion and reason is one of the great narratives of Western civilization. \n",
      "It helps define you as human. Without rationality, you are merely an emo-\n",
      "tional beast.\n",
      " This view of emotions has been around for millennia in various forms. \n",
      "Plato believed a version of it. So did Hippocrates, Aristotle, the Buddha, \n",
      "René Descartes, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Today, prominent \n",
      "thinkers such as Steven Pinker, Paul Ekman, and the Dalai Lama also offer \n",
      "up descriptions of emotions rooted in the classical view. The classical view \n",
      "is found in virtually every introductory college textbook on psychology, \n",

      " More significantly, the classical view of emotion is embedded in our so-\n",

      "autism spectrum disorder, are taught how to recognize facial configurations \n",
      "for specific emotions, ostensibly to help them communicate and relate to \n",
      "others.\n",
      " And yet . . . despite the distinguished intellectual pedigree of the classi-\n",
      "cal view of emotion, and despite its immense influence in our culture and \n",
      "society, there is abundant scientific evidence that this view cannot possibly \n",
      "be true. Even after a century of effort, scientific research has not revealed a \n",
      "consistent, physical fingerprint for even a single emotion. When scientists \n",
      "attach electrodes to a person’s face and measure how facial muscles actually \n",
      "move during the experience of an emotion, they find tremendous variety, \n",
      "not uniformity. They find the same variety  —  the same absence of finger-\n",

      " So what are they, really? When scientists set aside the classical view and \n",
      "just look at the data, a radically different explanation for emotion comes to \n",
      "light. In short, we find that your emotions are not built-in but made from \n",

      "They are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination \n",

      "metaphors to help understand brain activity; neurons are not wired in a \n",
      "strict hierarchy.) The first hierarchy in chapter 6 illustrates how the brain \n",
      "uses sensory input to form concepts, as a hierarchy of similarities and dif-\n",
      "ferences. This hierarchy is bottom-up and should be familiar to neuroscien-\n",

      "level, efficient, multisensory summary of the instance.\n",
      " The second hierarchy in chapter 4 illustrates how concepts unpack as \n",
      "predictions, based on the structure of the cortex. This hierarchy is top-down \n",
      "and incorporates some of my own discoveries. Body-budgeting circuitry \n",
      "(more commonly called visceromotor limbic circuitry), the loudmouth of \n",

      "don’t issue them to other cortical regions. In this manner, body-budgeting \n",

      "on the fly, for use in a specific situation, degeneracy is in play. Each instance \n",
      "is created with its own pattern of neurons. The more conceptually similar \n",
      "the instances are, the more the neural patterns will be close to one another \n",
      "in the default mode network, and some will even overlap, using some of the \n",

      "anything from centuries of scientific discovery, it’s that things aren’t always \n",
      "what they appear to be.\n",
      " The time-honored story of emotion goes something like this: We all have \n",
      "emotions built-in from birth. They are distinct, recognizable phenomena \n",
      "inside us. When something happens in the world, whether it’s a gunshot \n",
      "or a flirtatious glance, our emotions come on quickly and automatically, \n",
      "as if someone has flipped a switch. We broadcast emotions on our faces by \n",
      "way of smiles, frowns, scowls, and other characteristic expressions that any-\n",
      "one can easily recognize. Our voices reveal our emotions through laughter, \n",
      "shouts, and cries. Our body posture betrays our feelings with every gesture \n",
      "and slouch.\n",
      " Modern science has an account that fits this story, which I call the classi-\n",

      "voice launched a chain reaction that began in my brain. A particular set of \n",
      "neurons  —  call it the “sadness circuit”  —  leaped into action and caused my \n",

      "This collection of movements on the inside and outside of my body are said \n",
      "to be like a “fingerprint” that uniquely identifies sadness, much like your \n",

      " The classical view of emotion holds that we have many such emotion cir-\n",

      "\n",
      " Emotions are thus thought to be a kind of brute reflex, very often at odds \n",
      "with our rationality. The primitive part of your brain wants you to tell your \n",
      "boss he’s an idiot, but your deliberative side knows that doing so would \n",

      "emotion and reason is one of the great narratives of Western civilization. \n",
      "It helps define you as human. Without rationality, you are merely an emo-\n",

      " This view of emotions has been around for millennia in various forms. \n",
      "Plato believed a version of it. So did Hippocrates, Aristotle, the Buddha, \n",

      "metaphors to help understand brain activity; neurons are not wired in a \n",
      "strict hierarchy.) The first hierarchy in chapter 6 illustrates how the brain \n",
      "uses sensory input to form concepts, as a hierarchy of similarities and dif-\n",
      "ferences. This hierarchy is bottom-up and should be familiar to neuroscien-\n",

      "level, efficient, multisensory summary of the instance.\n",
      " The second hierarchy in chapter 4 illustrates how concepts unpack as \n",
      "predictions, based on the structure of the cortex. This hierarchy is top-down \n",
      "and incorporates some of my own discoveries. Body-budgeting circuitry \n",
      "(more commonly called visceromotor limbic circuitry), the loudmouth of \n",

      "don’t issue them to other cortical regions. In this manner, body-budgeting \n",

      "on the fly, for use in a specific situation, degeneracy is in play. Each instance \n",
      "is created with its own pattern of neurons. The more conceptually similar \n",
      "the instances are, the more the neural patterns will be close to one another \n",
      "in the default mode network, and some will even overlap, using some of the \n",
